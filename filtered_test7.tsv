Thus, developing an effective therapeutic strategy, especially searching for potential drugs, is the focus of current research. The exact mechanism of rutin in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. (2) Method: three pancreatic cancer cell lines were used to study the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of rutin. The potent anti-proliferative, anti-migration and pro-apoptotic properties of rutin were uncovered by cell viability, a wound-healing migration assay, and a cell apoptosis assay. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to detect the change of miRNAs expression. Immunoblotting analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptotic proteins. (3) Results: CCK-8 and EDU assays revealed that rutin significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cells’ proliferation (p < 0.05). A wound-healing assay showed that rutin significantly suppressed pancreatic cancer cells’ migration (p < 0.05). A flow cytometric assay showed that rutin could promote pancreatic cancer cells’ apoptosis. Intriguingly, rutin significantly upregulated miR-877-3p expression to repress the transcription of Bcl-2 and to induce pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis. Accordingly, rutin and miR-877-3p mimics could promote apoptotic protein expression. (4) Conclusions: our findings indicate that rutin plays an important role in anti-pancreatic cancer effects through a rutin-miR-877-3p-Bcl-2 axis and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.']	0.0614487510800821	0.5372071064802428	0.0178704805112174	36149	CCK	96	[]	0.20775012657002	7.080303933178968e-58	0.0091254752851711	10520	gant61	36691282
