Alzheimer’s	FYN	PP2	1	1 (not counting Acs)	strong 0 (mixed)		Score: 1 - Reasoning: The evidence from the provided texts suggests that PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor which includes Fyn, has a role in modulating processes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the evidence is not robust enough to conclude that Alzheimer's can be treated with PP2 through its interaction with Fyn, as the texts do not provide clinical evidence of PP2 being used as a treatment for AD. The texts do indicate that Fyn is implicated in AD pathology and that its inhibition could have therapeutic effects. Below is the score and reasoning for each PMID:  PMID 9600986: 0 - Reasoning: This text does not mention PP2 or Fyn directly, but it discusses the neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein and its impact on synaptic plasticity, which is relevant to AD pathology.  PMID 20655099: 1 - Reasoning: The text suggests that tau's role in targeting Fyn to the postsynapse is crucial for Abeta toxicity, implying that Fyn is involved in AD pathology. However, it does not directly address the treatment potential of PP2.  PMID 35820485: 1 - Reasoning: This text provides evidence that Fyn activation leads to phosphorylation events that are implicated in AD pathology, suggesting that inhibition of Fyn could be beneficial. However, it does not specifically mention PP2 as a treatment.  PMID 36639708: 0 - Reasoning: The text discusses the role of Fyn in synaptic degeneration in AD but does not provide evidence for the treatment potential of PP2.  PMID 35253743: 1 - Reasoning: The text links Fyn to AD and insulin signaling pathways, suggesting that Fyn inhibition could be a potential therapeutic strategy. However, it does not provide direct evidence for PP2 as a treatment.  PMID 11278378: 1 - Reasoning: This text shows that Fyn is involved in a signaling cascade that contributes to neuroprotection, which could be relevant to AD treatment. However, it does not provide evidence for PP2 specifically as a treatment.  PMID 11788577: 0 - Reasoning: This text discusses the phosphorylation of CagA by Src-like kinases, including Fyn, but does not relate to the treatment of AD with PP2.  PMID 36532777: 1 - Reasoning: The text indicates that Fyn is involved in TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory activation, which is relevant to AD pathology. The use of PP2 reduced this pro-inflammatory activation, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect.  PMID 34238111: 1 - Reasoning: The text describes the synthesis of SFK inhibitors as potential treatments for GBM, with some compounds showing similar activity to PP2. This suggests that PP2-like compounds could have therapeutic potential, but the text does not specifically address AD.  PMID 35185557: 1 - Reasoning: The text shows that inhibition of Fyn with PP2 attenuates cocaine-associated memory formation, which is relevant to synaptic plasticity and could be extrapolated to AD treatment. However, the evidence is indirect.  PMID 11278378: 1 - Reasoning: This text is a duplicate of an earlier PMID and thus does not provide additional evidence.  PMID 11756483: 1 - Reasoning: The text indicates that Fyn is involved in the response to Abeta treatment, which is relevant to AD. The use of PP2 blocked the phosphorylation events, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect.  PMID 30735733: 1 - Reasoning: The text suggests that Fyn inhibition by Panaxadiol could be beneficial in AD, which indirectly supports the potential of PP2 as a Fyn inhibitor. However, PP2 is not directly mentioned as a treatment.  PMID 33536910: 1 - Reasoning: The text shows that Fyn activity contributes to the formation of cocaine-associated memory, which is relevant to AD pathology. PP2 was used to inhibit Fyn, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect.  PMID 34818135: 1 - Reasoning: The text suggests that Aβ induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs, which is mediated by Fyn. PP2 attenuated this phosphorylation, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect in AD.  Overall, while there is evidence that Fyn plays a role in AD pathology and that its inhibition could be beneficial, the evidence for PP2 specifically as a treatment for AD is indirect and not fully substantiated by clinical data. Therefore, the hypothesis is likely true based on the provided texts, but more direct evidence is needed to confirm PP2 as a treatment for AD.

Score: 1 - The text indirectly supports the hypothesis by demonstrating that pp242 can induce autophagy, which is a process involved in NAFLD.  PMID 29154199: This text does not mention pp242 but discusses the down-regulation of autophagy-related proteins by UVB radiation in keratinocytes. Score: 0 - The text is not relevant to the hypothesis as it does not pertain to NAFLD or pp242.  PMID 37886951: This text does not mention pp242 but discusses the role of AMPK in metabolic stress and its effects on mTOR signaling and autophagy. Since pp242 is an mTOR inhibitor and ULK1 is downstream of mTOR, this could be indirectly relevant to the hypothesis. Score: 0 - The text does not directly support or refute the hypothesis but is tangentially related to the signaling pathways involved.  Overall, while none of the texts directly address the hypothesis that pp242 can treat NAFLD through its interaction with ULK1, there is indirect evidence that pp242 can induce autophagy and that ULK1 is involved in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Therefore, the hypothesis is likely true based on the provided texts, but more direct evidence would be needed to confirm the hypothesis.

pancreatic cancer	CCK	gant61	1	0	0 (AC is a 2, ABC is a 0)		Score: 1 - Reasoning: The provided biomedical texts offer some support for the hypothesis that pancreatic cancer can be treated with GANT61 through its interaction with components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which may include effects on cell proliferation and survival mechanisms that could be related to CCK-8 assays used to measure these effects. However, the texts do not provide a direct link between GANT61 and CCK (cholecystokinin) itself, but rather use CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8), a common reagent used to assess cell viability and proliferation, which is not the same as the peptide hormone CCK. The evidence suggests that GANT61 has an impact on pancreatic cancer cells by targeting the Hh signaling pathway and affecting cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance, which are important aspects of cancer treatment. However, the evidence does not directly address the interaction between GANT61 and CCK as a hormone or its receptors.  PMID 25889214: Score: 1 - Reasoning: This study provides evidence that GANT61 can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and potentiate the effects of gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent.

breast cancer	CDK4	ABEMACICLIB	2	2			Score: 2 - Reasoning: The evidence provided in the biomedical texts supports the hypothesis that breast cancer can be treated with abemaciclib through its interaction with CDK4. The texts describe the efficacy of abemaciclib, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), in treating hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. The studies report on the clinical benefits of abemaciclib in combination with other therapies, such as fulvestrant and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, and highlight its role in improving progression-free survival and overall response rates in patients with advanced breast cancer. The texts also discuss the management of adverse events associated with abemaciclib treatment, indicating that it is generally well-tolerated when managed appropriately. The evidence across multiple studies consistently demonstrates the therapeutic potential of abemaciclib in breast cancer treatment through its CDK4/6 inhibitory action.  PMID 26030518: Score: 2 - Reasoning: This study reports that the combination of palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor similar to abemaciclib) and fulvestrant resulted in longer progression-free survival than fulvestrant alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. This supports the hypothesis that CDK4/6 inhibitors can be effective in treating breast cancer.  PMID 19874578: Score: 2 - Reasoning: The text describes PD 0332991 (palbociclib), another CDK4/6 inhibitor, and its in vitro sensitivity across a panel of human breast cancer cell lines.

breast cancer	ESR1	estrogens	-2	-2			"Score: -2 - Reasoning: The evidence provided in the texts clearly refutes the hypothesis. There is a substantial amount of evidence in the provided texts that the hypothesis is false.  Justification: The hypothesis that ""breast cancer can be treated with estrogens through its interaction with ESR1"" is refuted by the evidence provided in the biomedical texts. The texts consistently describe the role of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α, encoded by ESR1) in breast cancer as one that promotes tumor growth and contributes to the development of resistance to endocrine therapies. Mutations in the ESR1 gene, particularly in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), lead to constitutive activation of the receptor, which results in estrogen-independent growth of breast cancer cells and resistance to anti-estrogen therapies.  PMID 24185510: -2 - The text reports that mutations in ESR1 result in constitutive activity of the receptor and continued responsiveness to anti-estrogen therapies in vitro, suggesting that these mutations are a mechanism of acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer therapy. This indicates that treating breast cancer with estrogens would likely exacerbate the condition rather than improve it.  PMID 24185512: -2 - This text also describes ESR1 mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the receptor, driving ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reducing the efficacy of ER antagonists. This suggests that estrogens would not be an effective treatment for breast cancer and could potentially worsen the disease by activating mutated receptors.  PMID 30733228: -2 - The study found that cells expressing mutated ER showed increased proliferation, migration, and in vivo tumorigenicity, even in the presence of estrogen. This indicates that estrogens, through their interaction with mutated ESR1, contribute to a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype, which contradicts the hypothesis.  PMID 30094493: -2 - The text discusses HER2 mutations in breast cancer and does not provide direct evidence regarding the treatment of breast cancer with estrogens through ESR1. However, it does highlight the complexity of breast cancer genetics and the potential for mutations to drive cancer progression, which indirectly supports the notion that activating mutations in receptors like ESR1 could be detrimental.  PMID 30225582: -2 - This text does not directly address the treatment of breast cancer with estrogens but discusses the prognostic relevance of copy number variations (CNVs) of genes, including ESR1. The implication is that genetic alterations, including those in ESR1, are associated with breast cancer prognosis, further suggesting that manipulating estrogen levels could have complex and potentially harmful effects.  PMID 15213208: -2 - This study is focused on the association between ESR1 haplotypes and the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease, not directly on breast cancer treatment. However, it does show that genetic variations in ESR1 can have significant health implications, which indirectly suggests that targeting ESR1 with estrogens could have unintended consequences.  PMID 31971970: -2 - This text discusses the role of estrogens in metabolic health and does not provide direct evidence for the treatment of breast cancer with estrogens through ESR1. However, it does highlight the importance of estrogen signaling in normal physiological functions, which could be disrupted by exogenous estrogen treatment in the context of breast cancer.  PMID 32408268: -2 - The text examines steroid-related transcripts during equine pregnancy and does not directly address human breast cancer treatment with estrogens. However, it does emphasize the complexity of steroid signaling, which could be relevant to understanding the risks of estrogen treatment in breast cancer.  PMID 33339644: -2 - This text discusses the importance of membrane estrogen receptor 1 (mESR1) in reproductive function and fertility, and while it does not directly address breast cancer treatment, it underscores the critical role of estrogen signaling in normal biological processes, suggesting that altering this signaling with exogenous estrogens could have negative effects.  PMID 12117397: -2 - This text reports on the risks of combined estrogen plus progestin use, including an increased incidence of breast cancer, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that estrogens could be used to treat breast cancer.  PMID 12824205: -2 - The text describes how estrogen plus progestin use increases the incidence of breast cancers that are diagnosed at a more advanced stage and also increases the percentage of women with abnormal mammograms. This evidence strongly suggests that estrogen treatment is not beneficial for breast cancer and may actually hinder diagnosis and promote more aggressive disease.  PMID 30181360: -2 - This review discusses the modulation of estrogen receptor function by other steroid receptors and signaling pathways, and how these interactions can affect drug resistance in breast cancer.

diabetes	GIPR	tirzepatide	2		2		Score: 2 - Reasoning: The provided biomedical texts offer substantial support for the hypothesis that diabetes can be treated with tirzepatide through its interaction with GIPR. Multiple studies and clinical trials cited in the texts demonstrate the efficacy of tirzepatide, a GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist, in improving glycemic control and inducing weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. The texts describe the mechanism of action of tirzepatide, which includes the activation of both the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), leading to enhanced insulin secretion and other metabolic benefits. The evidence is consistent across various studies, indicating that tirzepatide's interaction with GIPR is a key component of its therapeutic effect in diabetes management.  PMID 38070476: Score: 2 - Reasoning: This text discusses the efficacy of tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT 2 trial, highlighting its unprecedented efficacy in weight loss for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The text implies that the interaction with GIPR is part of the mechanism by which tirzepatide achieves its effects.  PMID 37946085: Score: 2 - Reasoning: The text provides evidence that GIPR agonists, and by extension GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonists like tirzepatide, decrease body weight and food intake through their action on GABAergic neurons. This supports the hypothesis that tirzepatide's interaction with GIPR contributes to its therapeutic effects in diabetes treatment.  PMID 37925022: Score: 2 - Reasoning: This study investigates a GIPR variant and its impact on metabolism, providing insights into the role of GIPR in metabolic regulation.

It indirectly supports the hypothesis by highlighting the significance of GIP and GLP-1 in the treatment of diabetes, which is relevant to tirzepatide's mechanism of action.  PMID 37897727: Score: 2 - Reasoning: The text discusses the role of ARRB2 in regulating GLP-1R and GIPR signaling, indicating that tirzepatide does not require ARRB2 for the potentiation of insulin secretion. This suggests that tirzepatide's interaction with GIPR is effective in the treatment of diabetes.  PMID 37591245: Score: 2 - Reasoning: This text provides a comprehensive overview of the development of tirzepatide and its dual activity at incretin receptors, including GIPR, for the treatment of metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity.  PMID 37498367: Score: 2 - Reasoning: The text presents findings that tirzepatide induces a thermogenic-like amino acid profile in brown adipose tissue, which may account for reduced systemic levels of BCAAs in obese insulin-resistant mice.

lupus	NAT2	Isoniazid	-2		-2		"Score: -2 - Reasoning: The evidence provided in the texts clearly refutes the hypothesis. There is a substantial amount of evidence in the provided texts that the hypothesis is false.  Justification: The hypothesis that ""lupus can be treated with Isoniazid through its interaction with NAT2"" is not supported by the provided biomedical texts. In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite, indicating that Isoniazid, a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, can lead to drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), which is an adverse reaction rather than a treatment for lupus.  PMID 35143075 discusses the risk factors associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mentions gene-environment interactions, including NAT2, but does not suggest that Isoniazid is a treatment for lupus. Instead, it focuses on the genetic and environmental risk factors for developing SLE.  PMID 32927458 reviews the relationship between NAT2 genotype and the metabolism of hydralazine hydrochloride, a drug used for hypertension, and its association with hydralazine-induced lupus. While it discusses NAT2's role in drug metabolism, it does not provide evidence that Isoniazid treats lupus.  PMID 28603631 examines the biotransformation pathways in HIV-infected patients and their risk for hypersensitivity reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics, comparing it to the risk in SLE patients. It does not mention Isoniazid as a treatment for lupus.  PMID 27914600 investigates the association of NAT2 gene polymorphisms with SLE and its clinical phenotypes, but does not suggest that Isoniazid is a treatment for lupus.  PMID 26408002 explores the metabolism of acebutolol and its potential to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE). It implicates NAT2 in the metabolism of drugs that can cause DILE, but does not support the use of Isoniazid to treat lupus.  PMID 37786472, PMID 37712488, PMID 37705856, and PMID 37693472 all discuss the role of NAT2 polymorphisms in the metabolism of isoniazid and its association with drug-induced hepatotoxicity or the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid in different populations. None of these texts suggest that Isoniazid is a treatment for lupus.  PMID 37344431 and PMID 37188064 describe cases where patients with tuberculosis experienced adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and drug-induced lupus erythematosus, while on anti-tuberculosis drugs, including Isoniazid. These cases further refute the hypothesis that Isoniazid could be used to treat lupus.  PMID 36262906 presents a case of a patient with SLE who experienced a severe flare-up of the disease after starting Isoniazid for latent TB, suggesting that Isoniazid can exacerbate lupus symptoms rather than treat them.  PMID 35482349 describes a case of neurotuberculosis where Isoniazid was part of the treatment regimen, but there is no indication that Isoniazid was used to treat lupus.  PMID 38051246, PMID 37454203, and PMID 35482349 do not provide relevant information regarding the treatment of lupus with Isoniazid.  Overall, the evidence from the provided texts strongly suggests that Isoniazid is associated with the development of drug-induced lupus erythematosus rather than being a treatment for lupus. The interaction with NAT2 is related to the metabolism of drugs and the risk of adverse reactions, not the therapeutic management of lupus."
