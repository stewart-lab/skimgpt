Such interactions are both more common and of more clinical relevance than often appreciated. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products have recently issued guidelines setting out in vitro and in vivo investigations to be conducted during drug development. These guidelines reflect the increasing interest of public health authorities in this topic. Cerivastatin is a novel, potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels at low daily doses. It is completely absorbed after oral administration, undergoes moderate first-pass metabolism and high plasma protein binding, and is cleared exclusively via hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP). Unlike other drugs of its class, cerivastatin has a dual metabolic pathway, with the involvement of more than one CYP isozyme. Metabolites are cleared via both biliary and renal excretion. On the basis of this pharmacokinetic profile and a knowledge of the target population, the formal in vivo interaction programme for cerivastatin investigated many important potential cerivastatin drug-drug interactions. Cerivastatin appears to lack clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, warfarin, antacid, cimetidine, nifedipine, omeprazole, erythromycin and itraconazole.']	0.3308127940737864	2.689687786375712e-101	0.0057694441362476	9013	omeprazole	36618932

His warfarin dosage was reduced and his INR stabilized. The fluvastatin was switched back to atorvastatin, and the warfarin dosage was increased to maintain the patient's goal INR. The literature supports a drug interaction between warfarin and fluvastatin due to the strong affinity of fluvastatin for the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6. This interaction has not been seen with atorvastatin. Lovastatin also reportedly has caused increases in INR when coadministered with warfarin. It is unclear whether simvastatin interacts with warfarin, but it may increase INRs slightly or increase serum simvastatin levels. One case report describes an interaction between simvastatin and the anticoagulant acenocoumarol, which resulted in an elevated INR. Pravastatin does not appear to interact with warfarin but has caused an increased INR when combined with the anticoagulant fluindione. Thus, until more definitive data are available, clinicians should monitor the INR closely after starting statin therapy in any patient receiving anticoagulation therapy.""]"	0.2430543585918116	5.57790815186769e-75	0.0039095224797542	10743	simvastatin	36618932
2	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	26	['PMID: 11523726 Text: Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Although irbesartan does not require biotransformation for its pharmacological activity, it does undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isoenzyme and negligible metabolism by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The long term treatment of patients with hypertension is generally required for effective management of the disease, and the use of concurrent medications is usually inevitable. This paper reviews the drug and food interaction trials involving irbesartan that have been conducted to date. Based on the available literature, no significant interactions have been identified between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, simvastatin, tolbutamide, warfarin, magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, digoxin or food. Fluconazole did increase the steady-state peak plasma concentration (by 19%) and area under the concentration-time curve (by 63%) of irbesartan, but these increases are not likely to be clinically significant. In summary, irbesartan has demonstrated minimal potential for drug or food interactions in trials conducted to date.']	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

Patients with chronic kidney disease often have multiple comorbidities that may necessitate the daily use of several types of medication. Therefore, the potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and selected drugs commonly taken by dialysis patients were investigated. Five Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover studies in healthy volunteers investigated the effect of a single dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide 1 g (based on iron content) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan 100 mg, furosemide 40 mg, omeprazole 40 mg, digoxin 0.5 mg and warfarin 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters [including area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-∞) and from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24)] for these drugs were determined: alone in the presence of food; with sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the presence of food; 2 h after food and sucroferric oxyhydroxide administration. Systemic exposure based on AUC0-∞ for all drugs, and AUC0-24 for all drugs except omeprazole (for which AUC 0-8 h was measured), was unaffected to a clinically significant extent by the presence of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, irrespective of whether sucroferric oxyhydroxide was administered with the drug or 2 h earlier. There is a low risk of drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide, digoxin and warfarin. There is also a low risk of drug-drug interaction with omeprazole (based on AUC0-∞ values). Therefore, sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be administered concomitantly without the need to adjust the dosage regimens of these drugs.']	0.0687992038776355	1.3501383941522289e-21	0.001244942421413	12852	furosemide	36618932

Currently used therapy is often having side effects and expensive, dietary interventions and alternative medicines are required. Clerodendrum colebrookianum has been used to treat cardiac hypertension but anticoagulant potency was not evaluated. To characterize an active anticoagulant fraction (AAFCC) and a 30\u202fkDa fibrin(ogen)olytic serine protease (clerofibrase) isolated from aqueous leave extract of C. colebrookianum. AAFCC/clerofibrase was subjected to extensive biochemical and pharmacological characterization including LC-MS/MS, amino acid compositional and GC-MS analyses. Interaction between clerofibrase with fibrinogen was studied by spectrofluorometric analysis. In vitro thrombolytic, antiplatelet and cytotoxicity assay were performed. In vivo toxicity, anticoagulant, defibrinogen and antithrombotic activities were determined on Swiss albino mice. The in vitro anticoagulant activity of AAFCC was found to be superior to heparin and clerofibrase and comparable to Nattokinase and warfarin. The proteomics and amino acid composition analyses suggest that clerofibrase is a previously uncharacterized novel plant protease capable of degrading the -αβ chains of fibrinogen/fibrin. AAFCC/clerofibrase exerts their anticoagulant action via fibrinogenolytic activity and partially by antiplatelet activity albeit they have no effect on thrombin and FXa inhibition. The spectrofluorometric analysis revealed the binding of clerofibrase to fibrinogen but not to thrombin and FXa. The phytochemical constituents and bioactive components of AAFCC were characterized by biochemical, and GC-MS analyses. The AAFCC and clerofibrase inhibited collagen/ADP-induced mammalian platelet aggregation, showed in vitro thrombolytic activity, and non-cytotoxic to mammalian cells. The AAFCC showed and dose-dependent in vivo plasma defibrinogenating and anticoagulant activities and inhibited k-carrageen-induced thrombus formation in the tails of mice. The potent in vivo anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects of AAFCC suggests its pharmacological significance as herbal anticoagulant drug for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperfibrinogenemia- and thrombosis associated cardiovascular disorders.']	0.0272456691782747	2.550024903198377e-09	0.0001905397037107	83972	heparin	36618932
