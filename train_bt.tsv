26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, which is a first-in-class agent to be approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, likely because of solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluations, with dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily being allowed for specific toxicities. Idelalisib may be administered without regard to food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant food effects, and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79 % increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Administration with the potent inducer rifampin resulted in a 75 % decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and, as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice-daily dosing increases the midazolam AUC 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no meaningful impact on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was noted for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60 % higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment; no relevant changes were observed with severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology programme, including drug-drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, which has allowed a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and their impact on clinical safety and efficacy.

27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare ocular diseases, which are commonly associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate clinical and laboratory features of SLE-associated episcleritis and scleritis, we now report 4 cases of inpatients who were diagnosed with episcleritis or scleritis secondary to SLE from September 2005 to July 2016 in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology in Peking University People's Hospital. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarized together with the treatment regimen and the prognosis; the literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patients. The average age was (49.0±23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1±1.4) years. In addition to the eye involvement, the patients had mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis and interstitial pneumonia simultaneously; in the past, 1 patient experienced arthritis, 2 presented Raynaud's phenomenon, and 2 had hematologic involvement. All the patients had antinuclear antibody (ANA) of high titer. The anti double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were increased in 2 patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other 1 patient did not test it. The complement levels were decreased in 3 patients. The systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores were more than 4 points in all the patients (ranging from 7-16), suggesting active disease. Ocular symptoms included pain, redness of the eye and tears. Ophthalmic examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Among the 4 patients, 2 patients experienced ocular complications including decrease in vision and uveitis. All the patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with hydroxycloroquine; 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All of the 4 patients received topical steroid and 1 patient received periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide; 1 patient received topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during the follow-ups. As a conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including SLE. The occurrence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active disease of SLE. Ocular complications need to be aware of in the patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment was associated with good visual outcomes in the follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	0
21701167	Background: Prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been tested for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert their benefit via inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins.  Methods: Thirty patients with documented CAD and triglycerides over 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/daily) and statins (simvastatin equivalence dose: 5-40 mg/daily) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor™ 1 g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or a placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks following PO-3A therapy.  Results: ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), formation of platelet-monocyte microparticles (p = 0.19) and the VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) only exhibited nonsignificant trends suggestive of reduced platelet activity. Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, closure time with the PFA-100 device and expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40-ligand (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A.  Conclusion: Independently of the dose and already at 1 week, short-term therapy with PO-3A provided a modest reduction of platelet activity biomarkers, despite concomitant aspirin and statin therapy, when compared to a placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests potential pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data call for confirmation in prospective studies.

12676734	This review outlines recent advances related to the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be interpreted by different cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, in both regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking events can also lead to AQP2 membrane accumulation via cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and l-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and by membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 recycles constitutively in epithelial cells, it can be inserted into different membrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and these pathways can be modulated by factors including hypertonicity. The roles of accessory proteins, including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion, are also being uncovered. Understanding cAMP-independent mechanisms for membrane insertion of AQP2 is especially relevant to the therapeutic bypassing of the mutated, dysfunctional vasopressin receptor in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30-40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.

38574433	Aims: Doxorubicin is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent for cancer, whose use is limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a novel analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has received widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.  Methods and results: Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggested that Bnip3 is the candidate gene that impaired the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter was injected into tail vein of C57/BL6J mice to overexpress BNIP3, specifically in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented the improvement in cardiac function caused by semaglutide. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide, via PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced BNIP3 expression in the mitochondria, improving mitochondrial function.  Conclusion: Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction via PI3K/AKT pathway, by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. The improvement in mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential therapy to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.  Keywords: BNIP3; Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; Mitochondria; PI3K/AKT; Semaglutide.

35455941	The GBA gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. Approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Clinically, GBA-associated PD is identical to sporadic PD, aside from the earlier age at onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment and more rapid progression. Mutations in GBA can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies, which are made up primarily of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the GBA gene may lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which may impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate dysfunction of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to aberrant lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Certain mutations cause GCase to be misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, a GCase deficiency has also been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with GBA-PD and highlights potential treatments which may act to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it features abnormal epidermal proliferation, infiltrating inflammatory cells and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  Objectives: To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis.  Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were evaluated with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model, as well as from cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination and degradation were examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and a cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein ECs. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, the Matrigel plug assay and quantification of vasculature in the mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelial-specific conditional KO mice were used.  Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-triggered PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination depended on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In the mouse model, Skp2 gene deficiency alleviated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelial-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly ameliorated psoriasis with diminished angiogenesis of papillae. Furthermore, topical use of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented the experimental psoriasis.  Conclusions: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach to treating psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		1
38178103	Background: Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear.  Methods: Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.  Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors.  Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.

26242379	Idelalisib, a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ, is the first agent in its class approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, exposure to idelalisib increased in a less than dose proportional manner, likely due to limited absorption of the drug. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily has been supported by extensive exposure-response evaluations, with dose reductions to 100 mg twice daily permitted in selected cases of toxicity. Idelalisib can be administered regardless of food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant nutritional effects and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in an approximately 79% increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Coadministration with the strong inducer rifampin resulted in a 75% reduction in idelalisib exposure (AUC), and as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. In contrast to idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice daily increased the midazolam AUC by 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporter P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In the population pharmacokinetic model, no significant effect on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was observed for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was approximately 60% higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment; No changes related to acute renal failure were observed. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology program, including drug-drug interaction studies and mechanistic and specific population studies, which allowed a comprehensive understanding of the clinical pharmacokinetics of idelalisib and its impact on safety and clinical efficacy.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were summarized along with treatment regimen and diagnosis. The literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patient. The mean age was (49.0±23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of epithelium or scleritis was (2.1±1.4) years. In addition to ocular involvement, patients had mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis, and interstitial pneumonia simultaneously; In the past, one patient had arthritis, two had Raynaud's phenomenon, and two had hematological diseases. All patients had high titer antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Antibody titers to double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) were increased in two patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other patient did not test for it. Complement levels decreased in 3 patients. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores were >4 points in all patients (range 7 to 16), indicating active disease. Ocular symptoms included pain, eye redness, and tears. Ophthalmological examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Of the four patients, two patients had ocular complications including decreased vision and uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids with hydroxychloroquine. 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All four patients received topical steroid and one patient received a periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide. One patient received topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). No recurrence of epitheliitis or scleritis was observed during follow-ups. In conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including SLE. The occurrence of epithelium and scleritis may indicate active SLE disease. Patients should be aware of ocular complications.

Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert its benefit by inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Methods: Thirty patients with documented coronary artery disease and triglycerides >250 mg/dL, treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/day) and statins (simvastatin equivalent dose: 5-40 mg/day) were randomized 1: 1:1 to Omacor™ 1 g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregation measurement, flow cytometry, and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and after 1 and 2 weeks of PO-3A treatment. RESULTS: ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP antigen IIb/IIIa (p = 0.031) activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, ​​while Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), platelet and monocyte microparticle formation (p = 0.19) and VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) showed only non-significant trends suggestive of a decrease Platelet activity.

(CD154), GP37 (CD165), intact PAR-1 receptors (SPAN 12) and cleaved epitopes (WEDE-15) were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Conclusion: Regardless of dose, already after 1 week, short-term treatment with PO-3A provided a modest reduction in biomarkers of platelet activity, despite concomitant aspirin and statin therapy, when compared with placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from other known antiplatelet agents and indicates possible pleiotropy. These preliminary randomized data require confirmation in future studies.

Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objectives: To study the potential role of S phase-associated protein kinase 2 (Skp2), an E3 enzyme and oncogene, in psoriasis. Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were assessed using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and the imiquimod-induced mouse model (IMQ), as well as from cultured endothelial cells. (European Commission). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination, and degradation were examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included fetal chorioallantoic membrane, Matrigel plug assay and quantification of angiogenesis in mouse lesions. Global knockout (KO) mice for the Skp2 gene and endothelium-specific conditional KO mice were used. Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced lesions of mice. Double immunostaining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-induced PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination depends on PTEN phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In a mouse model, deficiency of the Skp2 gene ameliorated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelium-specific Skp2 KO mice developed marked psoriasis with diminished angiogenesis of the papillae. Furthermore, topical application of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevents experimental psoriasis. Conclusions: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-stimulated angiogenesis may be a potential approach to treat psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		1
38178103	Background: Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, causal influences between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as mediators remain unclear. Methods: Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia were identified, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia. (PDD) from a large group of patients. -Summary data for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. Results: There were 20 positive causal effects and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and dementia. There were five positive causal effects and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementia. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines appear not to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.

26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, a first-in-class agent approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and small lymphoma. In a dose-ranging study, idelalisib exposure increased in a low dose-proportional manner, possibly due to solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluation, with a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily permitted for specific toxicities. Idelalisib can be administered without regard to dose based on the absence of clinically relevant dose effects, and was dosed accordingly in the primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Co-administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79% increase in idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Use of the strong inducer rifampin resulted in a 75% decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and thus, co-administration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed primarily by AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice daily increased midazolam AUC by 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no significant effect on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was observed for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60% higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment. No relevant changes were observed with severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology program, including drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, that has allowed a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and their impact on clinical safety and efficacy. .

27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare eye diseases, commonly associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate the clinical and laboratory features of episcleritis and scleritis associated with SLE, we now report 4 cases of patients with episcleritis or scleritis from September 2005 to July 2016 at the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Peking University People's Hospital. Secondary SLE was diagnosed. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarized along with treatment regimen and diagnosis. The literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patients. The mean age was (49.0 ± 23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1 ± 1.4) years. In addition to ocular involvement, patients may simultaneously present with phlegm symptoms, serositis, lupus nephritis, and interstitial pneumonia; Retrospectively, 1 patient experienced arthritis, 2 presented Raynaud's phenomenon, and 2 had hematologic involvement. All patients had a high titer of antinuclear antibody (ANA). Anti-double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were elevated in 2 patients. Three patients were positive for anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other 1 patient did not test for it. Complement levels were decreased in 3 patients. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores were greater than 4 points in all patients (range 7–16), suggesting active disease. Eye symptoms included pain, eye redness and tearing. Eye examination revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Of the 4 patients, 2 patients experienced ocular complications including loss of vision and uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids in combination with hydroxychloroquine. 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All of the 4 patients received a topical steroid and 1 patient received a periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide. 1 patient received a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during follow-ups. As a consequence, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including SLE. The presence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active SLE disease. Patients should be aware of ocular complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment was associated with good visual outcomes at follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	0
21701167	Background: Prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been evaluated for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias, and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert its benefit by inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activation in patients with documented stable CAD, independent of the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Methods: Thirty patients with documented CAD and triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/day) and statins (simvastatin equivalence dose: 5-40 mg/day) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor. ™ Done up to 1. g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks after PO-3A therapy. Results: ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) significantly decreased after PO-3A. while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), platelet-monocyte microparticles formation (p = 0.19) and VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) showed only non-significant Proposed to reduce Platteland. Activity Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced accumulation, closure time with the PFA-100 device and thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40-ligand (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Conclusions: Independently of dose and as early as 1 week, short-term therapy with PO-3A provided a modest reduction in platelet activity biomarkers compared to placebo, as well as aspirin and statin therapy. The effect of PO-3A is unique, different from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests possible pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data call for confirmation in prospective studies.

12676734	This review outlines recent advances in the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be perceived by various cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, both in regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking events may also lead to AQP2 membrane accumulation through cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, which binds sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and L-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase) 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also show that AQP2 partially recycles in epithelial cells, can be inserted into different membrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that these pathways are involved in hypertonicity, including can be modulated by factors. A role for accessory proteins including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive element-binding protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion is also being uncovered. Understanding the cAMP-independent mechanism for membrane insertion of AQP2 is particularly relevant to the treatment of patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a mutated, dysfunctional vasopressin receptor.

29520964	Coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), with either reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30–40% of patients) and HF hospitalizations. is associated with a higher risk of , all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) deaths. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and the direct deleterious effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in clinical practice. There are no specific restrictions for HF treatment in T2DM. Sub-analyses of HF treatment trials in the general population have shown that all HF treatments are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Regarding T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulfonylurias and insulin have been traditional second- and third-line therapies, although their safety in HF is controversial. Neither glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, is associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown significant reductions in HF hospitalizations in patients with CV disease or at risk for CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.

38574433	Objective: Doxorubicin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent for cancer, whose use is limited by its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a new analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has gained widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in reducing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Methods and Results: Doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly improved doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggested that Bnip3 was the candidate gene that impaired the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 was transfected with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) into the tail vein of C57/BLIPJ mice expressing the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter. The injection was done. Especially in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide-induced improvement in cardiac function. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide reduced BNIP3 expression in mitochondria through the PI3K/AKT pathway, improving mitochondrial function. Conclusion: Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction by downregulating BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Improvement of mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential therapy to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity. Keywords: BNIP3; doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; Mitochondria; PI3K/AKT; Semaglutide.

35455941	The GBA gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. About 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinically, GBA-associated PD is similar to sporadic PD, except for an earlier age of onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment, and more rapid progression. Mutations in GBA may be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are composed primarily of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the GBA gene can lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which can impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate impairment of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Some mutations cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, a GCase deficiency is also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with GBA-PD and highlights potential therapies that may work to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it is characterized by abnormal epidermal proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Abnormal expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objectives: To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis. Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were examined with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining in skin samples from psoriasis vulgaris and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice. model as well as from endothelial cells. (ECs). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination and degradation were examined in human umbilical vein ECs by co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting and cycloheximide chase assay. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays include quantification of vasculature in chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, Matrigel plug assay and mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelial-specific conditional KO mice were used. Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression enhanced, while Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration and formation of tube-like structures. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated activation. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination is dependent on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In a mouse model, Skp2 gene depletion ameliorated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelial-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly improved psoriasis with reduced angiogenesis of papillae. Furthermore, topical application of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented experimental psoriasis. Conclusion: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in angiogenesis associated with psoriasis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach for the treatment of psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		1

Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between gut microbiota and genetic susceptibility to dementia. In addition, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementia. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were mainly associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines do not seem to be mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.

26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor that is an approved first-line agent for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, the effect of idelalisib was slightly increased in a dose-proportional manner, possibly due to limited absorption of the solution. An approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily has been supported by extensive effect-response evaluations, with dose reductions to 100 mg twice daily for specific toxicities. Idelalisib can be used without regard to food based on the absence of clinically relevant food interactions and was given accordingly in initial efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Co-administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg resulted in a 79% increase in idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Administration with the strong inducer rifampin resulted in a 75% decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and therefore administration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib that is primarily formed via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A.

We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may suppress platelet activity beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins in patients with documented stable CAD. Methods: Patients with documented CAD and triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70–160 mg daily) and statins (simvastatin equivalent dose: 5–40 mg/day) were treated 1:1:1 with Omacor™ 1 has been changed. g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day or placebo for 2 weeks.

Conclusions: Independent of dose and as early as 1 week, short-term treatment with PO-3A resulted in a smaller reduction in biomarkers of platelet activity compared to placebo, despite aspirin and statin therapy. The effects of PO-3A are unique, different from those of other known antiplatelet agents, and suggest potential pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data require confirmation in future studies.

AQP2 is an attractive protein whose regulatory signals can be interpreted by various cell types to achieve apical or basement membrane insertion in regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking can induce AQP2 membrane accumulation through cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) increases in cGMP mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and l-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and membrane cholesterol depletion.

Roles of accessory proteins such as small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor binding protein receptors in AQP2 membrane insertion are also emerging.

The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, and direct myocardial damage of T2DM. T2DM is often underrecognized in HF patients and, conversely, emphasizes the importance of actively searching for both disorders in clinical practice. There are no limitations to HF therapy in T2DM. Subanalyses of HF treatment trials in the population showed that all HF treatments had similar effects regardless of T2DM. Regarding the treatment of T2DM in HF patients, most current guidelines recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulfonylureas and insulin are the usual second- and third-line therapies and have equal safety in HF. Neither glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Indeed, the DPP4 inhibitor saxagliptin has been associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization.

This review discusses the pathways involved in GBA-PD and suggests potential therapies that could target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common skin disease. Pathologically, there is abnormal epidermal proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Robust expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and disordered protein ubiquitination system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objectives: To investigate the possible role of S-phase kinase-related protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligand and an oncogene, in psoriasis. Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and an imiquimod (IMQ)-trained mouse model, as well as cultured endothelial cells. (EC). Protein interactions, substrate ubiquitination, and degradation were examined by co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and cycloheximide chase assays in human umbilical cord ECs. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMEC) for BrdU incorporation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis studies include the chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, the Matrigel plug assay, and vascular quantification in mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelium-specific conditional KO mice were used. Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced rat lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining shows that Skp2 expression is closely associated with hypervascular vasculature in the lesional dermal papilla. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression enhanced proliferation, while Skp2 knockdown prevented EC proliferation, migration, and tube-like formation. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway-repressing mechanosensitive phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been identified as a novel substrate of Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-induced PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination was dependent on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Skp2 gene deficiency attenuated IMQ-induced psoriasis in a mouse model. Importantly, endothelium-specific Skp2 KO mice treated with tamoxifen developed significantly improved psoriasis with reduced papilla angiogenesis. Furthermore, topical application of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 prevented experimental psoriasis. Conclusions: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-related angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach for the treatment of psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		1
38178103	Background: Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be linked to dementia. However, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as mediators remains unclear. Methods: Gut microbiota, cytokines and five types of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body (DLB), vascular dementia (VD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have been identified. Summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse weighting (IVW) was used as the primary statistical method. In addition, we investigated whether cytokines serve as mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative associations between genetic susceptibility to gut microbiota and dementia. There were also five positive and four negative associations between cytokines and dementia. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Results: Gut microbiota and cytokines were significantly associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines did not appear to mediate the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. Keywords: cytokines; Dementia; Gut microbiota; Mendelian randomization.	Dementia	IVW		0
26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, which is the first agent in its class to be approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lymphoma small lymphoid lymphoid. In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased less than proportionally with dose, likely due to solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily has been supported by extensive exposure and response assessments, with dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily permitted for specific toxicities. Idelalisib can be administered without regard to food based on the absence of clinically relevant food effects, and was therefore dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, at a dose of 400 mg once daily resulted in an approximately 79% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of idelalisib ( ASC). Administration with rifampicin, a strong inducer, resulted in a 75% decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and therefore co-administration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed primarily via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. Accordingly, administration of idelalisib 150 mg twice daily increases the AUC of midazolam by 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no significant impact on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was observed for any of the covariates tested. Exposure to idelalisib was approximately 60% higher in moderate to severe hepatic impairment; no significant changes were observed in severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology program, including drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, which has provided an in-depth understanding of the clinical pharmacokinetics of idelalisib and its impact on safety and clinical effectiveness.

27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare eye diseases, usually associated with rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To study the clinical and biological characteristics of episcleritis and scleritis associated with SLE, we now report 4 cases of hospitalized patients diagnosed with episcleritis or scleritis secondary to SLE from September 2005 to July 2016 in the department of Rheumatology and Immunology of Peking University People's Hospital. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were summarized along with treatment regimen and prognosis; the literature was reviewed. There were 3 female patients and 1 male patient. The mean age was (49.0 ± 23.8) years and the mean duration from SLE to onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1 ± 1.4) years. In addition to ocular involvement, patients simultaneously presented with mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis, and interstitial pneumonia; In the past, 1 patient suffered from arthritis, 2 presented with Raynaud's phenomenon and 2 had hematological damage. All patients had a high titer of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody titers increased in 2 patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other patient did not test for it. Complement levels decreased in 3 patients. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores were greater than 4 points in all patients (ranging from 7 to 16), suggesting active disease. Eye symptoms included pain, redness of the eyes and tears. Ophthalmological examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Among the 4 patients, 2 patients presented ocular complications including decreased vision and uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with hydroxycloroquine; 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All 4 patients received a topical steroid and 1 patient received a periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide; 1 patient received a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during follow-ups. In conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although rare, can occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including SLE. The occurrence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active SLE disease. Ocular complications should be considered in patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment were associated with good visual outcomes at follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	0
21701167	Background: Prescription ethyl esters of omega-3 acids (PO-3A) have been tested for their benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias, and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert its beneficial effects by inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Methods: Thirty patients with documented coronary artery disease and triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/day) and statins (simvastatin equivalent dose: 5-40 mg/day) were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Omacor™ 1. g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day or placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and 1 and 2 weeks after PO-3A treatment. Results: ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and its activity (p = 0.024) and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, ​​while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), platelet-monocyte microparticle formation (p = 0, 19) and the VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) showed only non-significant trends suggesting a reduction in platelet counts. activity. Finally, the aggregation induced by collagen and arachidonic acid, the closure time with the PFA-100 device and the expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63) , LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40 ligand. (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) PAR-1 receptor epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Conclusion: Independent of dose and from 1 week, short-term treatment with PO-3A resulted in a slight reduction in biomarkers of platelet activity, despite concomitant treatment with aspirin and statin, compared to placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from that of other known antiplatelet agents, and suggests potential pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data require confirmation by prospective studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	1
12676734	This review describes recent advances related to the molecular mechanisms and trafficking pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be interpreted by different cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, in regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated stimulatory effect of vasopressin on membrane AQP2 insertion, other signaling and trafficking events may also lead to membrane AQP2 accumulation via independent mechanisms. of cAMP. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and L-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 recycles constitutively in epithelial cells, that it can be inserted into different membrane domains of different cell types in vitro and in vivo, and that these pathways can be modulated by factors such as hypertonia. The roles of accessory proteins, including small GTPases and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment factor-binding protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion, are also uncovered. Understanding cAMP-independent mechanisms for membrane insertion of AQP2 is particularly relevant for therapeutic circumvention of the mutated and dysfunctional vasopressin receptor in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is common (30 to 40% of patients) and associated at a higher risk of hospitalization for HF. , all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in patients with HF, and vice versa, highlighting the importance of active investigation of both disorders in clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to the treatment of HF in T2D. Subanalyses of HF treatment trials in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are equally effective regardless of T2D. Regarding the treatment of T2DM in patients with HF, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin are the traditional second- and third-line treatments, although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for HF. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk for) HF. In recent trials, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin both showed a significant reduction in HF hospitalizations in patients with established cardiovascular disease or at risk of heart disease. Several ongoing trials are expected to provide insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.

38574433	Objectives: Doxorubicin is a potent cancer chemotherapeutic agent with limited use due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has received wide attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence highlights its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of semaglutide in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Methods and Results: Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly attenuated doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggests that Bnip3 is the candidate gene that impairs the protective effect of semaglutide against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter was injected into the vein caudal bone of C57/BL6J mice to overexpress BNIP3, specifically in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide-induced improvement in cardiac function. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide, via the PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, thereby improving mitochondrial function. Conclusion: Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction via the PI3K/AKT pathway, by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. Improving mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential treatment to reduce acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Keywords: BNIP3; Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; Mitochondria; PI3K/AKT; Semaglutide.

35455941	The GBA gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. Approximately 5–15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinically, GBA-associated PD is identical to sporadic PD, apart from an earlier age of onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment, and more rapid progression. GBA mutations can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key feature of PD is the presence of intraneuronal protein inclusions called Lewy bodies, consisting mainly of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the GBA gene can lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which can impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate dysfunction of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to aberrant lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide, and glucosylsphingosine. Certain mutations cause misfolding of GCase and its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, GCase deficiency has also been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with GBA-PD and highlights potential treatments that may act to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by abnormal epidermal proliferation, infiltrating inflammatory cells and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objectives: To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis. Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining of skin samples from psoriasis vulgaris patients and a model of mice induced by imiquimod (IMQ), as well as endothelial cells in culture. (THIS). Protein interaction, ubiquitination, and substrate degradation were examined by co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and a cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein ECs. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane, Matrigel plug assay, and quantification of vasculature in mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelium-specific conditional KO mice were used. Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from psoriasis patients and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Double immunofluorescent staining indicated a close association between Skp2 expression and excessive vascularization in lesional skin papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, while Skp2 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-triggered PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination was dependent on PTEN phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In the mouse model, Skp2 gene deficiency attenuated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelium-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly improved psoriasis with diminished papillae angiogenesis. Additionally, topical use of Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented experimental psoriasis. Conclusions: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-mediated angiogenesis could be a potential approach to treat psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		1
38178103	Background: Some studies have shown that the gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as mediators remain unclear. Methods: Gut microbiota, cytokines and five types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VD) and dementia due to Parkinson's disease (PDD), were identified from large genome-wide association study summary data (GWAS). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to study the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. Additionally, we examined whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the gut microbiota shift to dementia. Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Furthermore, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines did not appear to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.
