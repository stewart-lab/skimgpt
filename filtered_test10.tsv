0	657735	diabetes	646	['PMID 31687648: Diabetic bone disease is a complication of type I and type II diabetes, both of which are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. Increased hip and foot fracture rates do not correlate well with changes in bone mineral density (BMD), whereas studies support the importance of collagen structure to bone strength. Extracellular lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens resulting in aldehydes that subsequently form critically important biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. Although LOX-dependent biosynthetic crosslinks in bone collagen are deficient in diabetic bone, the expression and regulation of bone LOXs in diabetes have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. Moreover, we have identified a novel metabolic regulatory relationship that is dysregulated in diabetes using mouse models. Data indicate that the incretin (gastric hormone) known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that is anabolic to osteoblasts strongly upregulates LOX, and that this regulation is disrupted in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in mice. In vivo and in vitro studies support that diabetes results in elevated circulating peripheral dopamine, likely also derived from the gut, and is responsible for blocking GIP signaling and LOX levels in osteoblasts. Moreover, peripheral administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride to diabetic mice restored trabecular bone structure to near normal and partially reversed downregulation of LOX. Taken together our data identifies a novel metabolic relationship between the gut-derived hormone GIP and bone-derived LOX, and points to the importance of LOX dysregulation in the pathology of diabetic bone disease. © 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.', 'PMID 33567774: Lipids are an essential constituent of the cell membrane of which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the most important component. Activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) induces the release of PUFAs from the cell membrane that form precursors to both pro- and ant-inflammatory bioactive lipids that participate in several cellular processes. PUFAs GLA (gamma-linolenic acid), DGLA (dihomo-GLA), AA (arachidonic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are derived from dietary linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) by the action of desaturases whose activity declines with age. Consequently, aged cells are deficient in GLA, DGLA, AA, AA, EPA and DHA and their metabolites. LA, ALA, AA, EPA and DHA can also be obtained direct from diet and their deficiency (fatty acids) may indicate malnutrition and deficiency of several minerals, trace elements and vitamins some of which are also much needed co-factors for the normal activity of desaturases. In many instances (patients) the plasma and tissue levels of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA are low (as seen in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus) but they do not have deficiency of other nutrients. Hence, it is reasonable to consider that the deficiency of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA noted in these conditions are due to the decreased activity of desaturases and elongases. PUFAs stimulate SIRT1 through protein kinase A-dependent activation of SIRT1-PGC1α complex and thus, increase rates of fatty acid oxidation and prevent lipid dysregulation associated with aging. SIRT1 activation prevents aging. Of all the SIRTs, SIRT6 is critical for intermediary metabolism and genomic stability. SIRT6-deficient mice show shortened lifespan, defects in DNA repair and have a high incidence of cancer due to oncogene activation. SIRT6 overexpression lowers LDL and triglyceride level, improves glucose tolerance, and increases lifespan of mice in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects at the transcriptional level. PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory metabolites influence the activity of SIRT6 and other SIRTs and thus, bring about their actions on metabolism, inflammation, and genome maintenance. GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (pro- and anti-inflammatory metabolites of AA respectively) activate/suppress various SIRTs (SIRt1 SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6), PPAR-γ, PARP, p53, SREBP1, intracellular cAMP content, PKA activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). This implies that changes in the metabolism of bioactive lipids as a result of altered activities of desaturases, COX-2 and 5-, 12-, 15-LOX (cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenases respectively) may have a critical role in determining cell age and development of several aging associated diseases and genomic stability and gene and oncogene activation. Thus, methods designed to maintain homeostasis of bioactive lipids (GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA, DHA, PGE2, LXA4) may arrest aging process and associated metabolic abnormalities.']	0.0614487510800821	0.5372071064802428	0.0178704805112174	36149	LOX	96	['PMID 33222622: Inflammation plays a major role in the onset and progression of many diseases related to the respiratory system. Cysteinyl leukotrienes, the products of 5-LOX are a potent bronchoconstrictor. Vasicine, vasicinone and deoxyvasicine are the pyrroquinazoline alkaloids of <i>Adhatoda vasica</i> that are well known for their bronchodilatory activity. The current investigation evaluates the 5-LOX inhibitory potential of these alkaloids. Molecular docking results indicated that these alkaloids have similar binding energy as that of Zileuton, a commercial drug. Analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations, the binding free energy derived from MM-PBSA and interaction entropy indicated that vasicinone (-8.33\u2009kcal/mol) exhibited a binding free energy comparable to that of Zileuton (-8.52\u2009kcal/mol). The in-vitro results indicate the potential of vasicinone as a competitive inhibitor, while the in-silico results highlighted the potential of vasicine and deoxyvasicine as allosteric inhibitors. A possible mechanism behind the activity exhibited by the plant was also determined, which emphasized the potential of these alkaloids as leads for the design of novel 5-LOX inhibitors.', 'PMID 31796842: Regeneration is the unmatched liver ability for recovering its functional mass after tissue lost. Leukotrienes (LT) are a family of eicosanoids with the capacity of signaling to promote proliferation. We analyzed the impact of blocking LT synthesis during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Male Wistar rats were subjected to two-third PH and treated with zileuton, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Our first find was a significant increment of intrahepatic LTB4 during the first hour after PH together with an increase in 5-LOX expression. Zileuton reduced hepatic LTB4 levels at the moment of hepatectomy and also inhibited the increase in hepatic LTB4. This inhibition produced a delay in liver proliferation as seen by decreased PCNA and cyclin D1 nuclear expression 24\u2009h post-PH. Results also showed that hepatic LTB4 diminution by zileuton was associated with a decrease in NF-ĸB activity. Additionally, decreased hepatic LTB4 levels by zileuton affected the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) from zileuton-treated PH-rats displayed higher apoptosis than NPCs from PH control rats. In conclusion, the present work provides evidences that 5-LOX activation and its product LTB4 are involved in the initial signaling events for liver regeneration after PH and the pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme can delay the initial time course of the phenomenon.']	0.20775012657002	7.080303933178968e-58	0.0091254752851711	10520	zileuton	36691282
