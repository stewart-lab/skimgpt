MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases from 1966 to October 1993 using the Medical Subject Headings warfarin, drug interactions, and English only. All articles reporting original data on drug and food interactions with warfarin. Each report, rated independently by at least two investigators (using causality assessment), received a summary score indicating the level of assurance (level 1 = highly probable, level 2 = probable, level 3 = possible, and level 4 = doubtful) that a clinically important interaction had or had not occurred. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a weighted kappa statistic. Of 793 retrieved citations, 120 contained original reports on 186 interactions. The weighted kappa statistic was 0.67, representing substantial agreement. Of 86 different drugs and foods appraised, 43 had level 1 evidence. Of these, 26 drugs and foods did interact with warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was potentiated by 6 antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, isoniazid, metronidazole, and miconazole); 5 cardiac drugs (amiodarone, clofibrate, propafenone, propranolol, and sulfinpyrazone); phenylbutazone; piroxicam; alcohol (only with concomitant liver disease); cimetidine; and omeprazole. Three patients had a hemorrhage at the time of a potentiating interaction (caused by alcohol, isoniazid, and phenylbutazone). Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was inhibited by 3 antibiotics (griseofulvin, rifampin, and nafcillin); 3 drugs active on the central nervous system (barbiturates, carbamazepine, and chlordiazepoxide); cholestyramine; sucralfate; foods high in vitamin K; and large amounts of avocado. Many drugs and foods interact with warfarin, including antibiotics, drugs affecting the central nervous system, and cardiac medications. Many of these drug interactions increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect."", 'PMID 24550106: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used extensively for the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders, often over the long term, which raises the potential for clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving concomitant medications. These drug-drug interactions have been previously reviewed. However, the current knowledge is likely to have advanced, so a thorough review of the literature published since 2006 was conducted. This identified new studies of drug interactions that are modulated by gastric pH. These studies showed the effect of a PPI-induced increase in intragastric pH on mycophenolate mofetil pharmacokinetics, which were characterised by a decrease in the maximum exposure and availability of mycophenolic acid, at least at early time points. Post-2006 data were also available outlining the altered pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors with concomitant PPI exposure. New data for the more recently marketed dexlansoprazole suggest it has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin. The CYP2C19-mediated interaction that seems to exist between clopidogrel and omeprazole or esomeprazole has been shown to be clinically important in research published since the 2006 review; this effect is not seen as a class effect of PPIs. Finally, data suggest that coadministration of PPIs with methotrexate may affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics, although the mechanism of interaction is not well understood. As was shown in the previous review, individual PPIs differ in their propensities to interact with other drugs and the extent to which their interaction profiles have been defined. The interaction profiles of omeprazole and pantoprazole sodium (pantoprazole-Na) have been studied most extensively. Several studies have shown that omeprazole carries a considerable potential for drug interactions because of its high affinity for CYP2C19 and moderate affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole-Na appears to have lower potential for interactions with other medications. Lansoprazole and rabeprazole also seem to have a weaker potential for interactions than omeprazole, although their interaction profiles, along with those of esomeprazole and dexlansoprazole, have been less extensively investigated. Only a few drug interactions involving PPIs are of clinical significance. Nonetheless, the potential for drug interactions should be considered when choosing a PPI to manage gastric acid-related disorders. This is particularly relevant for elderly patients taking multiple medications, or for those receiving a concomitant medication with a narrow therapeutic index.', ""PMID 20002088: * Numerous cocktails using concurrent administration of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-selective probe drugs have been reported to investigate drug-drug interactions in vivo. * This approach has several advantages: characterize the inhibitory or induction potential of compounds in development toward the CYP enzymes identified in vitro in an in vivo situation, assess several enzymes in the same trial, and have complete in vivo information about potential CYP-based drug interactions. * This study describes a new cocktail containing five probe drugs that has never been published. * This cocktail can be used to test the effects of a new chemical entity on multiple CYP isoforms in a single clinical study: CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A (midazolam) and was designed to overcome potential liabilities of other reported cocktails. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selective substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol) and CYP3A (midazolam) when administered orally and concurrently as a cocktail relative to the drugs administered alone. This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, six-treatment six-period six-sequence William's design study with a wash-out of 7 or 14 days. Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC. There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25. The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo.""]"	0.3308127940737864	2.689687786375712e-101	0.0057694441362476	9013	omeprazole	36618932
1	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	42	"[""PMID 15260917: There is a worldwide increasing use of herbs which are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potential for herb-drug interactions. St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants. A literature search was performed using Medline (via Pubmed), Biological Abstracts, Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO and Embase (all from their inception to September 2003) to identify known drug interaction with St John's wort. The available data indicate that St John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PgP), although it may inhibit or induce other CYPs, depending on the dose, route and duration of administration. Data from human studies and case reports indicate that St John's wort decreased the blood concentrations of amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, fexofenadine, indinavir, methadone, midazolam, nevirapine, phenprocoumon, simvastatin, tacrolimus, theophylline and warfarin, whereas it did not alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, dextromethorphan, mycophenolic acid and pravastatin. St John's wort decreased the plasma concentration of the active metabolite SN-38 in cancer patients receiving irinotecan treatment. St John's wort did not alter the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, but increased the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Several cases have been reported that St John's wort decreased cyclosporine blood concentration leading to organ rejection. St John's wort caused breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancies when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives. It also caused serotonin syndrome when coadministered with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (e.g. sertaline and paroxetine). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in these interactions. Because the potential interaction of St John's wort with other drugs is a major safety concern, additional systematic research on herb-drug interactions and appropriate regulation in herbal safety and efficacy is needed.""]"	0.2430543585918116	5.57790815186769e-75	0.0039095224797542	10743	simvastatin	36618932

In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data."", 'PMID 18685566: The aim of this study was to determine whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between warfarin and orally administered anti-infectives increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in warfarin users. We conducted a nested case-control and case-crossover study using US Medicaid data. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between GI bleeding and prior use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, co-trimoxazole, or fluconazole vs. no exposure and also vs. use of cephalexin, which would not be expected to interact with warfarin. All of the anti-infectives examined were associated with elevated odds ratios (ORs) when compared to no exposure to these drugs. With cephalexin data as the reference, the ORs for co-trimoxazole (OR: 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-2.33) in the prior 6-10 days) and fluconazole (OR: 2.09 (95% CI: 1.34-3.26) in the prior 11-15 days) were significantly elevated. Warfarin users who had received an anti-infective agent showed a substantially increased risk of GI bleeding. However, a drug-drug interaction with warfarin was evident only for co-trimoxazole and fluconazole.', 'PMID 8801058: The results of studies of the effect of fluconazole on cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C9 activity in vivo and in vitro are used to develop an approach to the safe management of the warfarin-fluconazole drug interaction. This approach begins with a determination of an in vitro Ki value (22 microM), which may be used to relate fluconazole plasma concentrations to inhibitory effect on P4502C9 activity and (S)-warfarin half-life. A means for adding fluconazole to a therapeutic regimen of warfarin is proposed that involves a stepped reduction of the warfarin dose over 5 days to a final target daily dose that is determined by the fluconazole dose level. The effect of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability on outcome quality is explored in simulation studies that indicate that a stepped-dose reduction schedule will be superior to a one-time dose reduction. The in vivo K, was found to predict accurately the magnitude of the fluconazole interaction study with another P4502C9 substrate tolbutamide.']"	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

Based on previous studies, OTA is one of the major causes of the chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy known as Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and exerts several other adverse effects shown by cell and/or animal models. It is a well-known fact that OTA binds to various albumins with very high affinity. Recently, a few studies suggested that reducing the bound fraction of OTA might reduce its toxicity. Hypothetically, certain drugs can be effective competitors displacing OTA from its albumin complex. Therefore, we examined 13 different drug molecules to determine their competing abilities to displace OTA from human serum albumin (HSA). Competitors and ineffective chemicals were identified with a steady-state fluorescence polarization-based method. After characterization the competitive abilities of individual drugs, drug pairs were formed and their displacing activity were tested in OTA-HSA system. Indometacin, phenylbutazone, warfarin and furosemide showed the highest competing capacity but ibuprofen, glipizide and simvastatin represented detectable interaction too. Investigations of drug pairs raised the possibility of the presence of diverse binding sites of competing drugs. Apart from the chemical information obtained in our model, this explorative research might initiate future designs for epidemiologic studies to gain further in vivo evidence of long-term (potentially protective) effects of competing drugs administered to human patients.']	0.0687992038776355	1.3501383941522289e-21	0.001244942421413	12852	furosemide	36618932

The pathophysiology of HIT is related to a hypersensitivity reaction against complex platelet factor 4. The diagnosis is mostly clinical and is often confirmed by laboratory testing. Patients with HIT have a higher rate of thromboembolic complications, both arterial and venous, and with worse neurological outcomes at the time of discharge. Early diagnosis and heparin cessation are essential in the management of those patients. Both immediate and prolonged alternative anticoagulation are necessary.

AAFCC/clerofibrase was subjected to extensive biochemical and pharmacological characterization including LC-MS/MS, amino acid compositional and GC-MS analyses. Interaction between clerofibrase with fibrinogen was studied by spectrofluorometric analysis. In vitro thrombolytic, antiplatelet and cytotoxicity assay were performed. In vivo toxicity, anticoagulant, defibrinogen and antithrombotic activities were determined on Swiss albino mice. The in vitro anticoagulant activity of AAFCC was found to be superior to heparin and clerofibrase and comparable to Nattokinase and warfarin. The proteomics and amino acid composition analyses suggest that clerofibrase is a previously uncharacterized novel plant protease capable of degrading the -αβ chains of fibrinogen/fibrin. AAFCC/clerofibrase exerts their anticoagulant action via fibrinogenolytic activity and partially by antiplatelet activity albeit they have no effect on thrombin and FXa inhibition. The spectrofluorometric analysis revealed the binding of clerofibrase to fibrinogen but not to thrombin and FXa. The phytochemical constituents and bioactive components of AAFCC were characterized by biochemical, and GC-MS analyses. The AAFCC and clerofibrase inhibited collagen/ADP-induced mammalian platelet aggregation, showed in vitro thrombolytic activity, and non-cytotoxic to mammalian cells.
