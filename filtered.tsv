MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases from 1966 to October 1993 using the Medical Subject Headings warfarin, drug interactions, and English only. All articles reporting original data on drug and food interactions with warfarin. Each report, rated independently by at least two investigators (using causality assessment), received a summary score indicating the level of assurance (level 1 = highly probable, level 2 = probable, level 3 = possible, and level 4 = doubtful) that a clinically important interaction had or had not occurred. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a weighted kappa statistic. Of 793 retrieved citations, 120 contained original reports on 186 interactions. The weighted kappa statistic was 0.67, representing substantial agreement. Of 86 different drugs and foods appraised, 43 had level 1 evidence. Of these, 26 drugs and foods did interact with warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was potentiated by 6 antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, isoniazid, metronidazole, and miconazole); 5 cardiac drugs (amiodarone, clofibrate, propafenone, propranolol, and sulfinpyrazone); phenylbutazone; piroxicam; alcohol (only with concomitant liver disease); cimetidine; and omeprazole. Three patients had a hemorrhage at the time of a potentiating interaction (caused by alcohol, isoniazid, and phenylbutazone). Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was inhibited by 3 antibiotics (griseofulvin, rifampin, and nafcillin); 3 drugs active on the central nervous system (barbiturates, carbamazepine, and chlordiazepoxide); cholestyramine; sucralfate; foods high in vitamin K; and large amounts of avocado. Many drugs and foods interact with warfarin, including antibiotics, drugs affecting the central nervous system, and cardiac medications. Many of these drug interactions increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect."", 'PMID: 11510629 Text: Esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor (PPI) developed as a single isomer for the treatment of patients with acid related diseases. Because of the extensive use of PPIs, the documentation of the potential for drug interactions with esomeprazole is of great importance. Altered absorption or metabolism are 2 of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions. Since intragastric pH will increase with esomeprazole treatment, it can be hypothesised that the absorption of drugs with pH-sensitive absorption (e.g. digoxin and ketoconazole) may be affected. Esomeprazole does not seem to have any potential to interact with drugs that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 or 2E1. In drug interaction studies with diazepam, phenytoin and (R)-warfarin, it was shown that esomeprazole has the potential to interact with CYP2C19. The slightly altered metabolism of cisapride was also suggested to be the result of inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for cisapride mediated by CYP2C19. Esomeprazole did not interact with the CYP3A4 substrates clarithromycin (2 studies) or quinidine. Since the slightly increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of cisapride could be explained as an inhibition of CYP2C19, the data on these 3 CYP3A4 substrates indicate that esomeprazole does not have the potential to inhibit this enzyme. The minor effects reported for diazepam, phenytoin, (R)-warfarin, and cisapride are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Clarithromycin interacts with the metabolism of esomeprazole resulting in a doubling of the AUC of esomeprazole. The increased plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are unlikely to have any safety implications. It can be concluded that the potential for drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole is low, and similar to that reported for omeprazole.']"	0.3308127940737864	2.689687786375712e-101	0.0057694441362476	9013	omeprazole	36618932

As a group, these drugs are well tolerated apart from two uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects: elevation of liver enzymes and skeletal muscle abnormalities, which range from benign myalgias to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Adverse effects with statins are frequently associated with drug interactions because of their long-term use in older patients who are likely to be exposed to polypharmacy. The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin as a result of deaths from rhabdomyolysis illustrates the clinical importance of such interactions. Drug interactions involving the statins may have either a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic basis, or both. As these drugs are highly extracted by the liver, displacement interactions are of limited importance. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system plays an important part in the metabolism of the statins, leading to clinically relevant interactions with other agents, particularly cyclosporin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, that are also metabolised by this enzyme system. An additional complicating feature is that individual statins are metabolised to differing degrees, in some cases producing active metabolites. The CYP3A family metabolises lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, whereas CYP2C9 metabolises fluvastatin. Cerivastatin is also metabolised by CYP2C8. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by the CYP system. In addition, the statins are substrates for P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter present in the small intestine that may influence their oral bioavailability. In clinical practice, the risk of a serious interaction causing myopathy is enhanced when statin metabolism is markedly inhibited. Thus, rhabdomyolysis has occurred following the coadministration of cyclosporin, a potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, and lovastatin. Itraconazole has been shown to increase exposure to simvastatin and its active metabolite by at least 10-fold. Pharmacodynamically, there is an increased risk of myopathy when statins are coprescribed with fibrates or nicotinic acid. This occurs relatively infrequently, but is particularly associated with the combination of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil. Statins may also alter the concentrations of other drugs, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the statins should allow the avoidance of the majority of drug interactions. If concurrent therapy with known inhibitors of statin metabolism is necessary, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and the statin should be discontinued if necessary.', 'PMID: 15568889 Text: Bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Following oral administration, bosentan attains peak plasma concentrations after approximately 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability is about 50%. Food does not exert a clinically relevant effect on absorption at the recommended dose of 125 mg. Bosentan is approximately 98% bound to albumin and, during multiple-dose administration, has a volume of distribution of 30 L and a clearance of 17 L/h. The terminal half-life after oral administration is 5.4 hours and is unchanged at steady state. Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 3-5 days after multiple-dose administration, when plasma concentrations are decreased by about 50% because of a 2-fold increase in clearance, probably due to induction of metabolising enzymes. Bosentan is mainly eliminated from the body by hepatic metabolism and subsequent biliary excretion of the metabolites. Three metabolites have been identified, formed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4. The metabolite Ro 48-5033 may contribute 20% to the total response following administration of bosentan. The pharmacokinetics of bosentan are dose-proportional up to 600 mg (single dose) and 500 mg/day (multiple doses). The pharmacokinetics of bosentan in paediatric PAH patients are comparable to those in healthy subjects, whereas adult PAH patients show a 2-fold increased exposure. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min) and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) do not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of bosentan. No dosage adjustment in adults is required based on sex, age, ethnic origin and bodyweight. Bosentan should generally be avoided in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and/or elevated liver aminotransferases. Ketoconazole approximately doubles the exposure to bosentan because of inhibition of CYP3A4. Bosentan decreases exposure to ciclosporin, glibenclamide, simvastatin (and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin) and (R)- and (S)-warfarin by up to 50% because of induction of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9. Coadministration of ciclosporin and bosentan markedly increases initial bosentan trough concentrations. Concomitant treatment with glibenclamide and bosentan leads to an increase in the incidence of aminotransferase elevations. Therefore, combined use with ciclosporin and glibenclamide is contraindicated and not recommended, respectively. The possibility of reduced efficacy of CYP2C9 and 3A4 substrates should be considered when coadministered with bosentan. No clinically relevant interaction was detected with the P-glycoprotein substrate digoxin. In healthy subjects, bosentan doses >300 mg increase plasma levels of endothelin-1. The drug moderately reduces blood pressure, and its main adverse effects are headache, flushing, increased liver aminotransferases, leg oedema and anaemia. In a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study in PAH patients, the haemodynamic effects lagged the plasma concentrations of bosentan.']	0.2430543585918116	5.57790815186769e-75	0.0039095224797542	10743	simvastatin	36618932

The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.', ""PMID: 8801057 Text: Consistent with expectations based on human in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 6 days to six human volunteers significantly reduced the cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the warfarin enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data.""]"	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

EB was 64.5 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- S.D.) bound to HP. The percentage of bound EB was linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and a1 acid glycoprotein (a1AGP) bound 8.7 +/- 1.6 and 54.5 +/- 0.6%, respectively, of the drug. No binding of EB to HDL or LDL or human gamma globulins was found. For HSA separately, EB binding followed a non-saturable phenomenon with n\'K\' = 100 +/- 5, while for a1AGP the binding was following a saturable phenomenon with n"" = 1 +/- 0.045, K"" = 35,000 +/- 5000 M-1. It can then be shown that, in human plasma, EB is only bound to those two proteins: firstly by computing the binding of EB to HSA and a1AGP with the previously indicated parameters, and secondly by measuring the binding of EB to HP. The computed curve fairly fits to the measured one. Interaction of EB with HP involved hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen forces. Lower than 37 degrees C temperatures decreased EB binding. Significant competitive binding was demonstrated between EB and acetylsalicylic acid, furosemide, phenylbutazone, warfarin and bilirubin.', 'PMID: 9667024 Text: The influence of glycosylation on the drug binding of human serum albumin (HSA) was studied using HSA containing different amounts and degrees of glycosylated HSA.

The drug-HSA parameters (lognK) were measured by the ultrafiltration method, frontal analysis and a modified Hummel-Dreyer method. The modified Hummel-Dreyer method was the simplest method with high precision and required the smallest amounts of proteins. The lognK values were well correlated with the octanol-water partition coefficients; the correlation coefficients were over 0.95. The results suggested that hydrophobic interaction is the predominant force for the drug binding. The early stage of glycosylation of HSA did not significantly affect the drug-binding capacity. Generally, the binding affinity of HSA decreased, perhaps due to a conformational change or steric hindrance (except naproxen) when further glycosylation occurred.']"	0.0687992038776355	1.3501383941522289e-21	0.001244942421413	12852	furosemide	36618932

Various mechanisms have to be considered as causes for potential drug-drug interactions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring, the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, via either induction or inhibition. With the increasing use of PPIs, their interaction potential gains therapeutic importance as was the case with the first and second generation of H2-blockers (cimetidine and ranitidine, respectively). The enhanced selectivity of pantoprazole to the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase characterizes the new PPI generation. In contrast to omeprazole, pantoprazole has a low potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 system in man. In the drug interaction studies conducted so far, substrates for all relevant cytochrome P450 families involved in the metabolism of drugs in man were investigated.

Prasugrel is a third-generation thienopyridine, recently approved for prevention of thrombotic cardiovascular complications in patients with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Prasugrel is converted to its active metabolite (Pras-AM; compound R-138727) in two sequential steps: (i) rapid and complete hydrolysis by intestinal human carboxylesterase-2 to form a thiolactone intermediate; and (ii) oxidation of the thiolactone by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the gut and/or the liver. CYP3A and CYP2B6 are the primary CYPs contributing to Pras-AM formation, with smaller contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Prasugrel is rapidly absorbed and metabolized, with Pras-AM plasma concentrations peaking at about 0.5 hours after oral administration; this helps to account for the rapid onset of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) achieved by prasugrel. In the clinical pharmacology programme for prasugrel, bodyweight had the greatest effect of all covariates that were tested. In the phase III TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, the mean exposure to Pras-AM was 42% greater in patients weighing < 60 kg than in patients with the study population median bodyweight of 85 kg. In a pharmacodynamic meta-analysis of data from healthy subjects a decrease of 1 kg in bodyweight was associated with an increase in IPA of approximately 0.26 percentage points (p < 0.0001). Pras-AM exposure was greater in subjects aged ≥ 75 years, but exposure differences were not as large as those for bodyweight. Pras-AM exposure was greater in Asians than in Caucasians, but this appeared to result from a disproportionately greater exposure difference in Asian subjects with low bodyweight. Sex and allelic variation in CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, 3A4 and 3A5 appeared to have no clinically relevant effect on Pras-AM exposure or IPA. Consistent with the lack of association between genetic status and these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results in healthy subjects, no significant association was detected between these allelic variants and the composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Studies in renally impaired subjects and subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment have indicated that dose adjustment is not required in these patient populations. Prasugrel has few clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Potent CYP3A inhibitors, gastric acid suppressants and food have been shown to reduce the rate of formation of Pras-AM but not its overall exposure. This pharmacokinetic effect reduced the rate of onset of IPA after a loading dose but did not affect the peak IPA after a loading dose or the IPA during maintenance dosing. Potent induction of CYP3A, as well as smoking--which induces CYP1A2--did not affect Pras-AM exposure or IPA. Prior treatment with clopidogrel did not influence tolerability to prasugrel and did not appear to alter IPA during prasugrel treatment. Prasugrel did not affect the activities of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or P-glycoprotein, but it weakly inhibited CYP2B6. The inhibition of CYP2B6 is potentially clinically significant only for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window and have CYP2B6 as the primary elimination pathway.
