1	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	42	"['PMID: 12036392 Text: The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. As a group, these drugs are well tolerated apart from two uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects: elevation of liver enzymes and skeletal muscle abnormalities, which range from benign myalgias to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Adverse effects with statins are frequently associated with drug interactions because of their long-term use in older patients who are likely to be exposed to polypharmacy. The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin as a result of deaths from rhabdomyolysis illustrates the clinical importance of such interactions. Drug interactions involving the statins may have either a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic basis, or both. As these drugs are highly extracted by the liver, displacement interactions are of limited importance. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system plays an important part in the metabolism of the statins, leading to clinically relevant interactions with other agents, particularly cyclosporin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, that are also metabolised by this enzyme system. An additional complicating feature is that individual statins are metabolised to differing degrees, in some cases producing active metabolites. The CYP3A family metabolises lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, whereas CYP2C9 metabolises fluvastatin. Cerivastatin is also metabolised by CYP2C8. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by the CYP system. In addition, the statins are substrates for P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter present in the small intestine that may influence their oral bioavailability. In clinical practice, the risk of a serious interaction causing myopathy is enhanced when statin metabolism is markedly inhibited. Thus, rhabdomyolysis has occurred following the coadministration of cyclosporin, a potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, and lovastatin. Itraconazole has been shown to increase exposure to simvastatin and its active metabolite by at least 10-fold. Pharmacodynamically, there is an increased risk of myopathy when statins are coprescribed with fibrates or nicotinic acid. This occurs relatively infrequently, but is particularly associated with the combination of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil. Statins may also alter the concentrations of other drugs, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the statins should allow the avoidance of the majority of drug interactions. If concurrent therapy with known inhibitors of statin metabolism is necessary, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and the statin should be discontinued if necessary.', ""PMID: 15871634 Text: Ezetimibe is the first lipid-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised (>80%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.""]"	0.2430543585918116	5.57790815186769e-75	0.0039095224797542	10743	simvastatin	36618932
2	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	26	['PMID: 10709776 Text: This article reviews the metabolic pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the systemic antifungal agents: the azoles ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, the allylamine terbinafine and the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole. The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.', 'PMID: 9512916 Text: There are 3 main classes of systemic antifungals: the polyene macrolides (e.g. amphotericin B), the azoles (e.g. the imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole and the triazoles itraconazole and fluconazole) and the allylamines (e.g. terbinafine). Other systemic antifungals include griseofulvin and flucytosine. Most drug-drug interactions involving systemic antifungals have negative consequences. The interactions of amphotericin B, flucytosine, griseofulvin, terbinafine and azole antifungals can be divided into the following categories: (i) additive dangerous interactions; (ii) modifications of antifungal kinetics by other drugs; and (iii) modifications of the kinetics of other drugs by antifungals. Amphotericin B and flucytosine mainly interact with other agents pharmacodynamically. Clinically important drug interactions with amphotericin B cause nephrotoxicity, hypokalaemia and blood dyscrasias. The most important drug interaction of flucytosine occurs with myelotoxic agents. Hypokalaemia can precipitate the long QT syndrome, as well as potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias like torsade de pointes. Synergism is likely to occur when either QT interval-modifying drugs (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole) and drugs that induce hypokalaemia (e.g. amphotericin B) are coadministered. Induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes at hepatic and extrahepatic sites are the mechanisms that underlie the most serious pharmacokinetic drug interactions of the azole antifungals. These agents have been shown to notably decrease the catabolism of numerous drugs: histamine H1 receptor antagonists, warfarin, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, digoxin, felodipine, lovastatin, midazolam, triazolam, methylprednisolone, glibenclamide (glyburide), phenytoin, rifabutin, ritonavir, saquinavir, nevirapine and nortriptyline. Non-antifungal drugs like carbamazepine, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), phenytoin and rifampicin (rifampin) can induce the metabolism of azole antifungals. The bioavailability of ketoconazole and itraconazole is also reduced by drugs that increase gastric pH, such as H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and didanosine. Griseofulvin is an enzymatic inducer of coumarin-like drugs and estrogens, whereas terbinafine seems to have a low potential for drug interactions. Despite important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetic drug interactions during the 1990s, at this time they still remain difficult to predict in terms of magnitude in individual patients. This is because of the large interindividual and intraindividual variations in the catalytic activity of those metabolising enzymes that can either be induced or inhibited by various drugs. Notwithstanding these variations, increasing clinical experience is allowing pharmacokinetic interactions to be used to advantage in order to improve the tolerability of some drugs, as recently exemplified by the use of a fixed combination of ketoconazole and cyclosporin.']	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

EB was 64.5 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- S.D.) bound to HP. The percentage of bound EB was linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and a1 acid glycoprotein (a1AGP) bound 8.7 +/- 1.6 and 54.5 +/- 0.6%, respectively, of the drug. No binding of EB to HDL or LDL or human gamma globulins was found. For HSA separately, EB binding followed a non-saturable phenomenon with n\'K\' = 100 +/- 5, while for a1AGP the binding was following a saturable phenomenon with n"" = 1 +/- 0.045, K"" = 35,000 +/- 5000 M-1. It can then be shown that, in human plasma, EB is only bound to those two proteins: firstly by computing the binding of EB to HSA and a1AGP with the previously indicated parameters, and secondly by measuring the binding of EB to HP. The computed curve fairly fits to the measured one. Interaction of EB with HP involved hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen forces. Lower than 37 degrees C temperatures decreased EB binding. Significant competitive binding was demonstrated between EB and acetylsalicylic acid, furosemide, phenylbutazone, warfarin and bilirubin.', 'PMID: 3395358 Text: This paper describes the protein binding of cefazolin to human serum and to human serum albumin (HSA) using equilibrium dialysis. The drug is exclusively bound to HSA with a moderate affinity, Ka = 16,600 +/- 1600 M-1, and one saturable binding site, n = 0.73 +/- 0.02. Moreover cefazolin shows a dose-dependent binding leading a possible increase of the free fraction (when its total concentration increases). This antibiotic is displaced by free fatty acids (FFA) and bilirubin. Cefazolin binding to human serum and human serum albumin (HSA) was studied in presence of acidic drugs. At low concentrations clofibric acid and phenylbutazone both exhibiting high affinity for HSA displace strongly cefazolin. Valproic and salicylic acids, sulfamethoxazole, cefoperazone which have approximately the same affinity as cefazolin, must be used at higher concentrations to displace this antibiotic. A particular phenomenon was observed with cefazolin on HSA when associated with furosemide. A low concentration (5-25 microM) of this drug induces a positive cooperativity of binding between cefazolin and HSA. But at a molar ratio of furosemide to albumin greater than one, such cooperative interaction disappears and a competitive inhibition of cefazolin binding occurs. For all drugs studied, a competitive inhibition was found except for tryptophan. Finally, it is concluded that cefazolin shares the warfarin binding site on HSA.']"	0.0687992038776355	1.3501383941522289e-21	0.001244942421413	12852	furosemide	36618932

This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, six-treatment six-period six-sequence William's design study with a wash-out of 7 or 14 days. Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail).

Cimetidine is well known to interact with a number of concurrently administered drugs. Like cimetidine, ranitidine binds to cytochrome P-450 in the liver where it appears to exert an inhibitory effect, but to a lesser extent than cimetidine. Both H2-receptor antagonists may also reduce hepatic blood flow. Several drugs which are known to interact with cimetidine have been found not to interact significantly with ranitidine, including propranolol, lignocaine, phenytoin and diazepam. However, significant pharmacokinetic interactions between ranitidine and several other drugs have been established. These interactions may be attributed variously to an effect of ranitidine on hepatic metabolism or to an effect on the absorption of concomitantly administered drugs. For example, the bioavailability of midazolam is significantly increased due to the influence of ranitidine on gastric pH and thus on absorption of midazolam, leading to an increased soporific effect of this benzodiazepine; an effect of ranitidine on oxidative liver metabolism also appears to be a contributory factor in this interaction. Conversely, ranitidine distinctly reduced protein-bound cobalamin absorption from a mean of 7.66% prior to ranitidine administration to 0.84% during treatment with ranitidine 300 mg daily. A significant pharmacokinetic interaction has also been demonstrated between ranitidine and procainamide: the AUC of procainamide increased and the renal clearance fell significantly from a mean of 378 to 309 ml/min with ranitidine co-administration. However, this interaction is due to a different mechanism. In this case, ranitidine appears to compete with procainamide for the common renal proximal tubular secretion site. The reported interactions of ranitidine with warfarin, metoprolol, nifedipine, theophylline and fentanyl appear to be due to inhibition of cytochrome P-450. In a clinical study, warfarin clearance was significantly reduced from 66.7 to 48.7 ml/min by ranitidine, and by cimetidine to 42.9 ml/min. Similarly, the elimination half-lives of metoprolol and nifedipine were distinctly prolonged and the AUCs significantly increased by ranitidine. However, the latter pharmacokinetic interactions appear unlikely to be of clinical significance since the clinical effects of metoprolol and nifedipine were unaffected by ranitidine treatment. In therapeutic concentrations, ranitidine inhibited the disappearance of fentanyl from an in vitro microsomal preparation, indicating that it inhibits microsomal drug metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)']"	0.0347929189305711	7.571592140369909e-11	0.0010285420416559	7778	metoprolol	36618932

This study is, therefore, designed to evaluate the appropriateness of ceftriaxone utilization in government hospitals in Harar town. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in four government hospitals of Harar town by reviewing the medical records of 271 patients who received ceftriaxone from 1 January to 31 December 2016. Systematic random sampling was utilized to capture the medical records. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22.
