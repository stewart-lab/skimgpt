This study in patients with advanced cancer evaluated the effect of pazopanib on CYP450 function by comparing the pharmacokinetics of CYP-specific probe drugs in the presence and absence of pazopanib. The probes used included midazolam (CYP3A specific), warfarin (CYP2C9 specific), omeprazole (CYP2C19 specific), caffeine (CYP1A2 specific), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 specific). The estimated ratios of the geometric means (90% confidence interval (CI)) for the area under the curve to the last measurable point (AUC(0-t)) for these probe drugs with/without pazopanib were as follows: midazolam, 1.35 (1.18-1.54); omeprazole, 0.81 (0.59-1.12); caffeine, 1.00 (0.77-1.30); and S-warfarin, 0.93 (0.84-1.03). The geometric least-squares (LS) mean ratio of urine dextromethorphan:dextrorphan ranged from 1.33 (0-4-h interval) to 1.64 (4-8-h interval). The data suggest that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and has no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in patients with advanced cancer.']	0.3308127940737864	2.689687786375712e-101	0.0057694441362476	9013	omeprazole	36618932
1	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	42	['PMID 12036392: The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. As a group, these drugs are well tolerated apart from two uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects: elevation of liver enzymes and skeletal muscle abnormalities, which range from benign myalgias to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Adverse effects with statins are frequently associated with drug interactions because of their long-term use in older patients who are likely to be exposed to polypharmacy. The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin as a result of deaths from rhabdomyolysis illustrates the clinical importance of such interactions. Drug interactions involving the statins may have either a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic basis, or both. As these drugs are highly extracted by the liver, displacement interactions are of limited importance. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system plays an important part in the metabolism of the statins, leading to clinically relevant interactions with other agents, particularly cyclosporin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, that are also metabolised by this enzyme system. An additional complicating feature is that individual statins are metabolised to differing degrees, in some cases producing active metabolites. The CYP3A family metabolises lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, whereas CYP2C9 metabolises fluvastatin. Cerivastatin is also metabolised by CYP2C8. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by the CYP system. In addition, the statins are substrates for P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter present in the small intestine that may influence their oral bioavailability. In clinical practice, the risk of a serious interaction causing myopathy is enhanced when statin metabolism is markedly inhibited. Thus, rhabdomyolysis has occurred following the coadministration of cyclosporin, a potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, and lovastatin. Itraconazole has been shown to increase exposure to simvastatin and its active metabolite by at least 10-fold. Pharmacodynamically, there is an increased risk of myopathy when statins are coprescribed with fibrates or nicotinic acid. This occurs relatively infrequently, but is particularly associated with the combination of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil. Statins may also alter the concentrations of other drugs, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the statins should allow the avoidance of the majority of drug interactions. If concurrent therapy with known inhibitors of statin metabolism is necessary, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and the statin should be discontinued if necessary.']	0.2430543585918116	5.57790815186769e-75	0.0039095224797542	10743	simvastatin	36618932

MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases from 1966 to October 1993 using the Medical Subject Headings warfarin, drug interactions, and English only. All articles reporting original data on drug and food interactions with warfarin. Each report, rated independently by at least two investigators (using causality assessment), received a summary score indicating the level of assurance (level 1 = highly probable, level 2 = probable, level 3 = possible, and level 4 = doubtful) that a clinically important interaction had or had not occurred. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a weighted kappa statistic. Of 793 retrieved citations, 120 contained original reports on 186 interactions. The weighted kappa statistic was 0.67, representing substantial agreement. Of 86 different drugs and foods appraised, 43 had level 1 evidence. Of these, 26 drugs and foods did interact with warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was potentiated by 6 antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, isoniazid, metronidazole, and miconazole); 5 cardiac drugs (amiodarone, clofibrate, propafenone, propranolol, and sulfinpyrazone); phenylbutazone; piroxicam; alcohol (only with concomitant liver disease); cimetidine; and omeprazole. Three patients had a hemorrhage at the time of a potentiating interaction (caused by alcohol, isoniazid, and phenylbutazone). Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was inhibited by 3 antibiotics (griseofulvin, rifampin, and nafcillin); 3 drugs active on the central nervous system (barbiturates, carbamazepine, and chlordiazepoxide); cholestyramine; sucralfate; foods high in vitamin K; and large amounts of avocado. Many drugs and foods interact with warfarin, including antibiotics, drugs affecting the central nervous system, and cardiac medications. Many of these drug interactions increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect."", 'PMID 9512916: There are 3 main classes of systemic antifungals: the polyene macrolides (e.g. amphotericin B), the azoles (e.g. the imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole and the triazoles itraconazole and fluconazole) and the allylamines (e.g. terbinafine). Other systemic antifungals include griseofulvin and flucytosine. Most drug-drug interactions involving systemic antifungals have negative consequences. The interactions of amphotericin B, flucytosine, griseofulvin, terbinafine and azole antifungals can be divided into the following categories: (i) additive dangerous interactions; (ii) modifications of antifungal kinetics by other drugs; and (iii) modifications of the kinetics of other drugs by antifungals. Amphotericin B and flucytosine mainly interact with other agents pharmacodynamically. Clinically important drug interactions with amphotericin B cause nephrotoxicity, hypokalaemia and blood dyscrasias. The most important drug interaction of flucytosine occurs with myelotoxic agents. Hypokalaemia can precipitate the long QT syndrome, as well as potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias like torsade de pointes. Synergism is likely to occur when either QT interval-modifying drugs (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole) and drugs that induce hypokalaemia (e.g. amphotericin B) are coadministered. Induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes at hepatic and extrahepatic sites are the mechanisms that underlie the most serious pharmacokinetic drug interactions of the azole antifungals. These agents have been shown to notably decrease the catabolism of numerous drugs: histamine H1 receptor antagonists, warfarin, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, digoxin, felodipine, lovastatin, midazolam, triazolam, methylprednisolone, glibenclamide (glyburide), phenytoin, rifabutin, ritonavir, saquinavir, nevirapine and nortriptyline. Non-antifungal drugs like carbamazepine, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), phenytoin and rifampicin (rifampin) can induce the metabolism of azole antifungals. The bioavailability of ketoconazole and itraconazole is also reduced by drugs that increase gastric pH, such as H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and didanosine. Griseofulvin is an enzymatic inducer of coumarin-like drugs and estrogens, whereas terbinafine seems to have a low potential for drug interactions. Despite important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetic drug interactions during the 1990s, at this time they still remain difficult to predict in terms of magnitude in individual patients. This is because of the large interindividual and intraindividual variations in the catalytic activity of those metabolising enzymes that can either be induced or inhibited by various drugs. Notwithstanding these variations, increasing clinical experience is allowing pharmacokinetic interactions to be used to advantage in order to improve the tolerability of some drugs, as recently exemplified by the use of a fixed combination of ketoconazole and cyclosporin.', ""PMID 8801057: Consistent with expectations based on human in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 6 days to six human volunteers significantly reduced the cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the warfarin enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data."", 'PMID 15654717: To assess the frequency of potential azole-drug interactions and consequences of interactions between fluconazole and other drugs in routine inpatient care. We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients treated for systemic fungal infections with an oral or intravenous azole medication between July 1997 and June 2001 in a tertiary care hospital. We recorded the concomitant use of medications known to interact with azole antifungals and measured the frequency of potential azole drug interactions, which we considered to be present when both drugs were given together. We then performed a chart review on a random sample of admissions in which patients were exposed to a potential moderate or major drug interaction with fluconazole. The list of azole-interacting medications and the severity of interaction were derived from the DRUGDEX System and Drug Interaction Facts. Among the 4,185 admissions in which azole agents (fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole) were given, 2,941 (70.3%) admissions experienced potential azole-drug interactions, which included 2,716 (92.3%) admissions experiencing potential fluconazole interactions. The most frequent interactions with potential moderate to major severity were co-administration of fluconazole with prednisone (25.3%), midazolam (17.5%), warfarin (14.7%), methylprednisolone (14.1%), cyclosporine (10.7%) and nifedipine (10.1%). Charts were reviewed for 199 admissions in which patients were exposed to potential fluconazole drug interactions. While four adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by fluconazole were found, none was felt to be caused by a drug-drug interaction (DDI), although in one instance fluconazole may have contributed. Potential fluconazole drug interactions were very frequent among hospitalized patients on systemic azole antifungal therapy, but they had few apparent clinical consequences.']"	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

This study examines the structural basis for HSA binding of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM via competition with drugs having known albumin binding sites. Warfarin, furosemide, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, benzylpenicillin, and cephmandole were added to HSA solutions at drug:HSA mole ratios from 0 to 8:1, followed by quantification of radiopharmaceutical binding to HSA by ultrafiltration. Warfarin, a site IIA drug, progressively displaced both [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM from HSA. At 8:1 warfarin:HSA mole ratios, free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM levels increased 300-500%. This was in contrast to solutions containing ibuprofen, a site IIIA drug; no increase in free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM or [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM was observed except at high ibuprofen:HSA ratios, where secondary ibuprofen binding to the IIA site may cause modest radiopharmaceutical displacement. By contrast, and consistent with earlier findings suggesting Cu-ETS exhibits only nonspecific associations, [(64)Cu]Cu-ETS binding to HSA was unaffected by the addition of drugs that bind in either site. We conclude that the species-dependence of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM albumin binding arises from interaction(s) with the IIA site of HSA.']	0.0687992038776355	1.3501383941522289e-21	0.001244942421413	12852	furosemide	36618932

The pDDIs with warfarin were identified using the interaction screening program Drug-Reax, Micromedex Healthcare Series 1.0. Two hundred and two inpatients were monitored. The mean of 10 different drugs was prescribed for each patient (SD = 3.6). At least 1 major or moderate pDDIs with warfarin per patient was observed, the mean was 3.6 (SD = 1.6). The most common pDDIs with warfarin involved in the increase of anticoagulation effect were enoxaparin (32.2%), simvastatin (27.6%), omeprazole (22.5%), and tramadol (21.5%). For 32 patients (15.8%), interventions were rejected, and they had a higher risk (relative risk= 2.17; 95% confidence interval 1.10-4.27) for abnormal test results (INR > 5). Multivariate analysis showed that age, length of hospital stay, exposure to ≥4 major or moderate pDDIs, and refusal of pharmacist recommendations contribute significantly to the patient's INR result >5. Consequently, the risk of bleeding is increased. Major and moderate pDDIs with warfarin are very common in inpatients and are associated with INR results outside the therapeutic range.

However, LMWHs are so far only administered by parenteral route. Thus, they are usually replaced by oral warfarin for outpatient therapy. Since warfarin has a slow onset and high incidence of drug-drug interaction, there is a great need for the development of an oral LMWH formulation. LMWH (tinzaparin)-loaded nanoparticles prepared with a blend of a polyester and a polycationic polymethacrylate by the double emulsion method were administered orally in fasted rabbits. The plasma tinzaparin concentration was measured by a chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay. After oral administration of two doses of tinzaparin-loaded nanoparticles (200 and 600 anti-Xa U/kg), the oral absorption was observed between 4 and 10 or 12 h, with a delayed onset of action ranging from 3 to 4 h. Mean absolute bioavailabilities were 51% and 59% for the two tested doses. We now report that the encapsulation of tinzaparin into nanoparticles is likely to contribute to its oral efficacy with an anticoagulant effect prolonged up to 8 h.', 'PMID 28263937: Knowledge about drug-drug interactions commonly arises from preclinical trials, from adverse drug reports, or based on knowledge of mechanisms of action. Our aim was to investigate whether drug-drug interactions were discoverable without prior hypotheses using data mining. We focused on warfarin-drug interactions as the prototype. We analyzed altered prothrombin time (measured as international normalized ratio [INR]) after initiation of a novel prescription in previously INR-stable warfarin-treated patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Data sets were retrieved from clinical work. Random forest (a machine-learning method) was set up to predict altered INR levels after novel prescriptions. The most important drug groups from the analysis were further investigated using logistic regression in a new data set. Two hundred and twenty drug groups were analyzed in 61\u2009190 novel prescriptions. We rediscovered 2 drug groups having known interactions (β-lactamase-resistant penicillins [dicloxacillin] and carboxamide derivatives) and 3 antithrombotic/anticoagulant agents (platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate], and heparins) causing decreasing INR. Six drug groups with known interactions were rediscovered causing increasing INR (antiarrhythmics class III [amiodarone], other opioids [tramadol], glucocorticoids, triazole derivatives, and combinations of penicillins, including β-lactamase inhibitors) and two had a known interaction in a closely related drug group (oripavine derivatives [buprenorphine] and natural opium alkaloids). Antipropulsives had an unknown signal of increasing INR. We were able to identify known warfarin-drug interactions without a prior hypothesis using clinical registries. Additionally, we discovered a few potentially novel interactions. This opens up for the use of data mining to discover unknown drug-drug interactions in cardiovascular medicine.', 'PMID 11085346: Thrombolytic agents activate plasminogen and induce a systemic fibrinolytic and anticoagulant state. Interaction of fibrinolysis with coagulation and platelet aggregation might be important for synergistic interactions with other antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. Thrombolytic agents are most often used in patients with coexisting cardiovascular medication, including various antihypertensives, beta-blocking agents, nitrates and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). In acute coronary syndromes, anticoagulants and antiplatelet compounds such as clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists might be given. Inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 system are not reported to affect the pharmacokinetics of any thrombolytic agent. Since the elimination of the recombinant plasminogen activators saruplase and alteplase is dependent on liver blood flow, drugs affecting hepatic blood flow could theoretically affect the hepatic clearance of these agents. In fact, a reduction in thrombolytic activity has only been demonstrated for alteplase with nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate). Pharmacodynamic interactions occur more often. The additive and beneficial effect of aspirin as concomitant therapy to thrombolysis has been demonstrated without excessive bleeding rates. No data are available on the interaction between ticlopidine or clopidogrel and thrombolytic agents in humans. Anticoagulation by heparin concomitantly with thrombolysis improves the patency rate of the occluded coronary vessel, but bleeding complications are seen more frequently. Although there has been no controlled study on the interaction between oral anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, patients with myocardial infarction who were taking an oral anticoagulant before admission seem to be at higher risk for intracranial haemorrhage during thrombolytic therapy. Currently, no recommendations can be given for possible dose adjustment of thrombolytic therapy in patients receiving antiplatelet comedication. For comedication with heparin, it has been advised to monitor activated partial thromboplastin time frequently and to avoid values >2.5-fold normal. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment should be monitored frequently for bleeding and the physician should be aware of any comedication exerting antiplatelet (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or anticoagulant (e.g. warfarin) effects.']	0.0272456691782747	2.550024903198377e-09	0.0001905397037107	83972	heparin	36618932
