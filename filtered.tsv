1	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	42	"[""Recently, interactions of herbal medicines with synthetic drugs came into focus of particular interest. In the past 3 years, more than 50 papers were published regarding interactions between St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.; SJW) and prescription drugs. Co-medication with SJW resulted in decreased plasma concentrations of a number of drugs including amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, indinavir, irinotecan, warfarin, phenprocoumon, alprazolam, dextrometorphane, simvastatin, and oral contraceptives. Sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports indicate that SJW is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4) and/or P-glycoprotein. Recent studies could show that the degree of enzyme induction by SJW correlates strongly with the amount of hyperforin found in the product. Products that do not contain substantial amounts of hyperforin (<1%) have not been shown to produce clinically relevant enzyme induction. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that hyperforin may also contribute to the antidepressant activity of SJW. However, clinical studies using SJW preparations with a low hyperforin amount (<1%) clearly demonstrated the superiority of this plant extract over placebo and its equivalence to imipramine and fluoxetine in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of depression. In the present paper clinical significant SJW interactions are critically evaluated against the background of hyperforin.""]"	0.2430543585918116	5.57790815186769e-75	0.0039095224797542	10743	simvastatin	36618932

The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.', ""Consistent with expectations based on human in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 6 days to six human volunteers significantly reduced the cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the warfarin enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data.""]"	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

This study examines the structural basis for HSA binding of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM via competition with drugs having known albumin binding sites. Warfarin, furosemide, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, benzylpenicillin, and cephmandole were added to HSA solutions at drug:HSA mole ratios from 0 to 8:1, followed by quantification of radiopharmaceutical binding to HSA by ultrafiltration. Warfarin, a site IIA drug, progressively displaced both [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM from HSA. At 8:1 warfarin:HSA mole ratios, free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM levels increased 300-500%. This was in contrast to solutions containing ibuprofen, a site IIIA drug; no increase in free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM or [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM was observed except at high ibuprofen:HSA ratios, where secondary ibuprofen binding to the IIA site may cause modest radiopharmaceutical displacement. By contrast, and consistent with earlier findings suggesting Cu-ETS exhibits only nonspecific associations, [(64)Cu]Cu-ETS binding to HSA was unaffected by the addition of drugs that bind in either site. We conclude that the species-dependence of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM albumin binding arises from interaction(s) with the IIA site of HSA.']	0.0687992038776355	1.3501383941522289e-21	0.001244942421413	12852	furosemide	36618932

This pertains to a prospective study involving inpatients who started warfarin therapy in a university hospital located in southern Brazil. The pDDIs with warfarin were identified using the interaction screening program Drug-Reax, Micromedex Healthcare Series 1.0. Two hundred and two inpatients were monitored. The mean of 10 different drugs was prescribed for each patient (SD = 3.6). At least 1 major or moderate pDDIs with warfarin per patient was observed, the mean was 3.6 (SD = 1.6). The most common pDDIs with warfarin involved in the increase of anticoagulation effect were enoxaparin (32.2%), simvastatin (27.6%), omeprazole (22.5%), and tramadol (21.5%). For 32 patients (15.8%), interventions were rejected, and they had a higher risk (relative risk= 2.17; 95% confidence interval 1.10-4.27) for abnormal test results (INR > 5). Multivariate analysis showed that age, length of hospital stay, exposure to â‰¥4 major or moderate pDDIs, and refusal of pharmacist recommendations contribute significantly to the patient's INR result >5. Consequently, the risk of bleeding is increased. Major and moderate pDDIs with warfarin are very common in inpatients and are associated with INR results outside the therapeutic range. Pharmaceutical interventions concerning the management of interactions by providing information to physicians can improve the patient safety.""]"	0.0173861052724603	1.583282174785851e-05	0.0007506098705197	5329	enoxaparin	36618932

However, LMWHs are so far only administered by parenteral route. Thus, they are usually replaced by oral warfarin for outpatient therapy. Since warfarin has a slow onset and high incidence of drug-drug interaction, there is a great need for the development of an oral LMWH formulation. LMWH (tinzaparin)-loaded nanoparticles prepared with a blend of a polyester and a polycationic polymethacrylate by the double emulsion method were administered orally in fasted rabbits. The plasma tinzaparin concentration was measured by a chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay. After oral administration of two doses of tinzaparin-loaded nanoparticles (200 and 600 anti-Xa U/kg), the oral absorption was observed between 4 and 10 or 12 h, with a delayed onset of action ranging from 3 to 4 h. Mean absolute bioavailabilities were 51% and 59% for the two tested doses. We now report that the encapsulation of tinzaparin into nanoparticles is likely to contribute to its oral efficacy with an anticoagulant effect prolonged up to 8 h.', ""Drug interactions resulting in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major health problem both for individuals and the community. Despite this, limited information is reported in the literature on the drug interaction categories responsible for causing ADRs. In the study reported here, we investigated the drug combinations most frequently co-reported as interacting in the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database, VigiBase, and categorised these according to the drug interaction mechanism. Reports in which drug combinations were co-reported as interacting in at least 20 reports in VigiBase during the past 20 years were included in the study. Each drug combination was reviewed in the literature to identify the mechanism of interaction and subsequently classified as pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic reaction. Report characteristics were also analysed. A total of 3766 case reports of drug interactions from 47 countries were identified. Of the 123 different drug combinations reported, 113 were described in the literature to interact. The mechanism of the drug interaction was categorised as pharmacodynamic (46 combinations; 41%), pharmacokinetic (28; 25%), a combination of both types (18; 16%) and unidentified (21; 19%). Pharmacodynamic drug interactions primarily concerned pharmacological additive effects, whereas enzyme inhibition was the most frequent pharmacokinetic interaction. The combinations reviewed primarily implicated drugs such as warfarin, heparin, carbamazepine and digoxin. Drug interactions reported in globally collected ADR reports cover both pharmacodynamic, specifically additive pharmacological effects, and pharmacokinetic mechanisms primarily accredited to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. These ADR reports often concern serious threats to patients' safety and are particularly related to the use of high risk drugs such as warfarin and heparin."", 'Tinzaparin, a sodium salt of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) produced via heparinase digestion, is used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism in conjunction with warfarin for the prevention of DVT in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, and as an anticoagulant in hemodialysis circuits. Its average molecular weight ranges between 5500 and 7500 daltons (Da); the percentage of chains with molecular weight lower than 2000 Da is not more than 10% in the marketed tinzaparin formulation. While this fraction is generally considered pharmacologically inactive, this has never been evaluated in vivo. The importance of the < 2000 Da fraction on the anticoagulant pharmacodynamics of tinzaparin assessed by anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity was studied in a two-way crossover trial. In this trial, 30 healthy volunteers received a single 175 IU/kg subcutaneous administration of tinzaparin containing approximately 3.5% of the < 2000 Da fraction and a tinzaparin-like LMWH containing 18.3% of the < 2000 Da fraction. The anti-Xa/anti-IIa ratios of the drug substances were comparable at 1.5 and 1.7 for tinzaparin and the tinzaparin-like LMWH, respectively. Both formulations were safe and well tolerated. Mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity (A(max)) was approximately 0.818 IU/ml at 4 h following tinzaparin injection. Mean maximum plasma anti-IIa activity was 0.308 IU/ml at 5 h postdose. Intersubject variation was lower (< 18% for both anti-Xa and anti-IIa metrics) than in previous fixed-dose administration studies. There was no correlation between anti-Xa or anti-IIa AUC or A(max) and bodyweight in the present study supporting the weight-adjusted dosing regimen. Individual anti-Xa and anti-IIa profiles following the single 175 IU/kg subcutaneous administration of the tinzaparin-like LMWH were similar to that obtained with tinzaparin. Based on average equivalence criteria, the two LMWH preparations were determined to be bioequivalent using either anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity as biomarkers. The calculated intrasubject variabilities were low (< 14% for anti-Xa activity and < 18% for anti-IIa activity) yielding little evidence for a significant Subject x Formulation interaction. In summary, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity following a single subcutaneous administration of tinzaparin 175 IU/kg to healthy volunteers yielded activity consistent with targeted therapeutic levels derived from previous trials in adult DVT patients. Weight-based dosing for the treatment of DVT appears rational based on the reduction in anti-Xa and anti-IIa variability consistent with the recommendation derived from earlier fixed-dose pharmacokinetic studies. Furthermore, differences in the percentage of molecules in the < 2000 Da molecular weight fraction of tinzaparin do not translate into differences in anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity in vivo.', 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically encountered arrhythmia affecting 0.4% of the general population. Its prevalence increases with age, affecting more than 6% of people over 80 years of age. The annual risk of ischemic stroke in patients with lone AF is approximately 1.3%. This annual risk increases up to 10% -12% in patients with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation and placebo showed a risk reduction of 61% (95% CI 47% to 71%). The absolute risk reduction for stroke with oral anticoagulants is about 3% per year. Aspirin has been shown in meta-analyses to have on average a 20-25% relative risk reduction, and is inferior to oral anticoagulants. In high risk patients with AF warfarin is a class I ACC/AHA indication unless there is a contraindication for anticoagulation. Unfortunately, this therapy requires frequent monitoring with blood samples and the interaction with food and several medications makes its use difficult and sometimes unreliable. It requires strict patient compliance and its use is also linked to potentially serious bleeding complications. In clinical practice, less than 60% of patients who do not have contraindications to oral anticoagulation are actually receiving them. Additionally, of those that receive oral anticoagulation, less than 50% are consistently within therapeutic targets. As such, the ""real world"" efficacy of a strategy towards prescribing oral anticoagulants is likely significantly lower than that demonstrated in clinical trials. As such, the need to discover other methods of anticoagulation with oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and minimal interactions with diet and other pharmacological agents is imperative. Low molecular weight heparin has a more predictable bioavailability and a longer half-life, but its subcutaneous mode of administration and long-term risks, in particular, osteoporosis makes the chronic use of this medication non-feasible. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel have proven efficacy and superiority compared to aspirin to prevent systemic vascular events in at-risk patient populations, but currently they do not play an important role in the prevention of AF related thromboembolic events. The ACTIVE study is a randomized trial comparing the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to oral anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with AF, and was unfortunately terminated prematurely by the data safety and monitoring board because of increased events in the antiplatelet arm. Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as ximelagatran, may be as effective as warfarin for stroke-risk reduction in patients with AF. No anticoagulation monitoring is needed and it has excellent bioavailability, with a twice-daily oral dose. Elevation of liver enzymes was an initial concern regarding the use of this new drug, which is not available for general use. Ongoing pharmacological research and future clinical trials may one day leave the ""warfarin days"" behind. Unfortunately, the new therapies that are being tested seem to be at least several years away from being available on a widespread basis. In this review, we discuss the underlying pathophysiology of AF and stroke. We also provide a comprehensive discussion regarding various available therapies to treat AF.', 'The incidence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in neurological patients continues to increase with expansion of indication for neurointerventional procedures. The pathophysiology of HIT is related to a hypersensitivity reaction against complex platelet factor 4. The diagnosis is mostly clinical and is often confirmed by laboratory testing. Patients with HIT have a higher rate of thromboembolic complications, both arterial and venous, and with worse neurological outcomes at the time of discharge. Early diagnosis and heparin cessation are essential in the management of those patients. Both immediate and prolonged alternative anticoagulation are necessary. Understanding of the mechanism of action, indication and drug interaction of the alternative anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors, fondaparinux and danaparoid) and warfarin is essential during management of these patients.']"	0.0272456691782747	2.550024903198377e-09	0.0001905397037107	83972	heparin	36618932
