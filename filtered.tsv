2	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	26	"['This article reviews the metabolic pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the systemic antifungal agents: the azoles ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, the allylamine terbinafine and the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole. The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.', ""Consistent with expectations based on human in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 6 days to six human volunteers significantly reduced the cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the warfarin enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data."", 'The aim of this study was to determine whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between warfarin and orally administered anti-infectives increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in warfarin users. We conducted a nested case-control and case-crossover study using US Medicaid data. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between GI bleeding and prior use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, co-trimoxazole, or fluconazole vs. no exposure and also vs. use of cephalexin, which would not be expected to interact with warfarin. All of the anti-infectives examined were associated with elevated odds ratios (ORs) when compared to no exposure to these drugs. With cephalexin data as the reference, the ORs for co-trimoxazole (OR: 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-2.33) in the prior 6-10 days) and fluconazole (OR: 2.09 (95% CI: 1.34-3.26) in the prior 11-15 days) were significantly elevated. Warfarin users who had received an anti-infective agent showed a substantially increased risk of GI bleeding. However, a drug-drug interaction with warfarin was evident only for co-trimoxazole and fluconazole.', 'To assess the frequency of potential azole-drug interactions and consequences of interactions between fluconazole and other drugs in routine inpatient care. We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients treated for systemic fungal infections with an oral or intravenous azole medication between July 1997 and June 2001 in a tertiary care hospital. We recorded the concomitant use of medications known to interact with azole antifungals and measured the frequency of potential azole drug interactions, which we considered to be present when both drugs were given together. We then performed a chart review on a random sample of admissions in which patients were exposed to a potential moderate or major drug interaction with fluconazole. The list of azole-interacting medications and the severity of interaction were derived from the DRUGDEX System and Drug Interaction Facts. Among the 4,185 admissions in which azole agents (fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole) were given, 2,941 (70.3%) admissions experienced potential azole-drug interactions, which included 2,716 (92.3%) admissions experiencing potential fluconazole interactions. The most frequent interactions with potential moderate to major severity were co-administration of fluconazole with prednisone (25.3%), midazolam (17.5%), warfarin (14.7%), methylprednisolone (14.1%), cyclosporine (10.7%) and nifedipine (10.1%). Charts were reviewed for 199 admissions in which patients were exposed to potential fluconazole drug interactions. While four adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by fluconazole were found, none was felt to be caused by a drug-drug interaction (DDI), although in one instance fluconazole may have contributed. Potential fluconazole drug interactions were very frequent among hospitalized patients on systemic azole antifungal therapy, but they had few apparent clinical consequences.']"	0.1218219725659474	3.8424567580901135e-38	0.0017788724685276	14616	fluconazole	36618932

Apixaban molecule is developed in a joint venture by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Apixaban, a coagulation factor Xa inhibitor, approved in the E.U. in 2011 for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adult patients, who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement. The Apixaban based drug will be marketed under the brand name EliquisÂ® and is expected to rack up annual sales of over $2.5 billion. Apixaban is expected to provide stiff competition to warfarin, a popular blood thinner used in Europe. Warfarin is known to cause some serious side effects in patients. Apixaban, as compared with aspirin, reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients experiencing atrial fibrillation by more than 50% (from 3.7% per annum with aspirin to 1.6% per annum with apixaban). Apixaban exhibits superiority to enoxaparin in preventing thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery with similar bleeding rates. Apixaban is a highly selective and potent Factor Xa Inhibitor with Ki=0 8nM to both free as well as prothrombinase bound FXa. In X-ray crystal structure studies indicate that the pyrazole N-2 nitrogen atom interacts with backbone of Gln192 and the carbonyl oxygen of carboxamide interacts with NH of Gly216. The orientation of phenyllactum in the S4 region indiacates an edge to face interaction with Trp215, which is positioned between the Tyr99 and Phe174. In the present review, we have tried to cover comparative study of various FXa-inhibitors and point out apixaban in the various aspect including molecular chemistry, physical properties, commercial synthesis, current patent status, crystalline polymorphic forms, molecular receptor interaction, pharmacophore rational, mechanism of action, clinical studies, preclinical, adverse effect, available formulation, dose regimen and co-therapy, thus giving emphasis on medicinal chemistry aspects.']	0.0173861052724603	1.583282174785851e-05	0.0007506098705197	5329	enoxaparin	36618932

7	989	warfarin&drug&interaction	16	"['Coumarin derivatives combine 3 unfavorable properties which make them prone to potentially life threatening drug-drug interactions: (i) high protein binding; (ii) cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism; and (iii) a narrow therapeutic range. An entire list of drugs which are supposed to interact with coumarins (mostly with warfarin) comprises about 250 different compounds. Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of coadministration during acute cardiac events. Both drugs are shown to enhance the activated partial thromboplastin time response to heparin.', ""Drug interactions resulting in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major health problem both for individuals and the community. Despite this, limited information is reported in the literature on the drug interaction categories responsible for causing ADRs. In the study reported here, we investigated the drug combinations most frequently co-reported as interacting in the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database, VigiBase, and categorised these according to the drug interaction mechanism. Reports in which drug combinations were co-reported as interacting in at least 20 reports in VigiBase during the past 20 years were included in the study. Each drug combination was reviewed in the literature to identify the mechanism of interaction and subsequently classified as pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic reaction. Report characteristics were also analysed. A total of 3766 case reports of drug interactions from 47 countries were identified. Of the 123 different drug combinations reported, 113 were described in the literature to interact. The mechanism of the drug interaction was categorised as pharmacodynamic (46 combinations; 41%), pharmacokinetic (28; 25%), a combination of both types (18; 16%) and unidentified (21; 19%). Pharmacodynamic drug interactions primarily concerned pharmacological additive effects, whereas enzyme inhibition was the most frequent pharmacokinetic interaction. The combinations reviewed primarily implicated drugs such as warfarin, heparin, carbamazepine and digoxin. Drug interactions reported in globally collected ADR reports cover both pharmacodynamic, specifically additive pharmacological effects, and pharmacokinetic mechanisms primarily accredited to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. These ADR reports often concern serious threats to patients' safety and are particularly related to the use of high risk drugs such as warfarin and heparin."", 'Knowledge about drug-drug interactions commonly arises from preclinical trials, from adverse drug reports, or based on knowledge of mechanisms of action. Our aim was to investigate whether drug-drug interactions were discoverable without prior hypotheses using data mining. We focused on warfarin-drug interactions as the prototype. We analyzed altered prothrombin time (measured as international normalized ratio [INR]) after initiation of a novel prescription in previously INR-stable warfarin-treated patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Data sets were retrieved from clinical work. Random forest (a machine-learning method) was set up to predict altered INR levels after novel prescriptions. The most important drug groups from the analysis were further investigated using logistic regression in a new data set. Two hundred and twenty drug groups were analyzed in 61\u2009190 novel prescriptions. We rediscovered 2 drug groups having known interactions (Î²-lactamase-resistant penicillins [dicloxacillin] and carboxamide derivatives) and 3 antithrombotic/anticoagulant agents (platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate], and heparins) causing decreasing INR. Six drug groups with known interactions were rediscovered causing increasing INR (antiarrhythmics class III [amiodarone], other opioids [tramadol], glucocorticoids, triazole derivatives, and combinations of penicillins, including Î²-lactamase inhibitors) and two had a known interaction in a closely related drug group (oripavine derivatives [buprenorphine] and natural opium alkaloids). Antipropulsives had an unknown signal of increasing INR. We were able to identify known warfarin-drug interactions without a prior hypothesis using clinical registries. Additionally, we discovered a few potentially novel interactions. This opens up for the use of data mining to discover unknown drug-drug interactions in cardiovascular medicine.']"	0.0272456691782747	2.550024903198377e-09	0.0001905397037107	83972	heparin	36618932
