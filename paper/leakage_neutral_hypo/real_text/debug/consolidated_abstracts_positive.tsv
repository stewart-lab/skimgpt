Breast Cancer	Abemaciclib	"PMID: 580237. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Abemaciclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Abemaciclib, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical and early-phase clinical trials. This phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 672 patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly every 28 days) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the abemaciclib group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to the placebo group (median PFS: 16.4 vs. 9.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.68; p < 0.001). The ORR was significantly higher in the abemaciclib arm (35.6% vs. 18.9%, p < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward benefit (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62–1.01; p = 0.06). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the abemaciclib group were neutropenia (24.3%) and diarrhea (12.1%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:** Abemaciclib significantly improves PFS and ORR in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, with a tolerable safety profile. These findings support the use of abemaciclib as a standard-of-care treatment in this population. Further follow-up is warranted to confirm OS benefits.

PMID: 632330. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Abemaciclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial  

**Background:** Abemaciclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in improving outcomes for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. This study evaluated its efficacy and safety compared to standard endocrine therapy alone.  

**Population:** A total of 672 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or control arm.  

**Intervention:** Patients in the intervention arm received abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, and 29, then every 28 days).  

**Comparison:** The control arm received fulvestrant plus placebo.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 24.5 months, the abemaciclib group demonstrated significantly longer median PFS (16.4 months vs. 9.2 months in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.68; p < 0.001). The ORR was 35.6% in the abemaciclib group versus 18.9% in the control group (p < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60–1.02; p = 0.06). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the abemaciclib arm were neutropenia (24.1%) and diarrhea (9.8%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:** Abemaciclib combined with fulvestrant significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, supporting its use as a standard therapy in this population. Further follow-up is needed to confirm OS benefits.

PMID: 433862. **Abstract**  
Abemaciclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. This multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy compared to endocrine therapy alone in 672 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint, with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety profile. After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the abemaciclib combination group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS (28.6 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.67; p < 0.001) compared to the control arm. The OS data, though immature, showed a favorable trend (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61–1.02; p = 0.067). The ORR was significantly higher in the abemaciclib group (48.3% vs. 21.4%; p < 0.001), with a median duration of response of 24.9 months versus 12.5 months (p < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the abemaciclib arm were diarrhea (83.2%), neutropenia (41.5%), and fatigue (35.7%), though these were predominantly grade 1–2 and manageable with dose adjustments. Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent PFS benefits across all predefined subgroups, including prior endocrine therapy exposure and visceral metastasis status. These findings underscore abemaciclib as a transformative treatment option, significantly prolonging PFS and enhancing clinical outcomes in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term survival benefits and optimize therapeutic sequencing in this patient population.

Abemaciclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) in 669 patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on prior ET. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) plus ET (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor) or placebo plus ET. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 22.3 months, the abemaciclib arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo arm (16.4 vs. 9.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.68; p < 0.001). OS data, though immature, showed a trend toward benefit (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57–1.02; p = 0.06). The ORR was significantly higher in the abemaciclib group (48.1% vs. 21.3%; p < 0.001), with a median duration of response of 25.6 months (95% CI 20.4–30.2) versus 12.9 months (95% CI 9.1–16.7) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the abemaciclib arm were diarrhea (82.3%), neutropenia (45.7%), and fatigue (39.1%), though grade 3/4 AEs were manageable with dose adjustments. These findings underscore abemaciclib’s significant clinical benefit in improving PFS and ORR in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, reinforcing its role as a standard-of-care treatment in this patient population. Further follow-up is warranted to confirm OS benefits and long-term safety.

This study evaluated its efficacy and safety in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer patients.  

**Population:** A total of 672 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (n=336) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n=336).  

**Intervention:** The experimental arm received abemaciclib (150 mg orally twice daily) combined with fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, and 29, then every 4 weeks). The control arm received placebo plus fulvestrant on the same schedule.  

**Comparison:** Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR) were compared between the two arms. Safety profiles were also assessed.  

**Outcomes:** The median PFS was significantly longer in the abemaciclib group (16.4 months [95% CI: 14.2–18.6]) compared to the placebo group (9.2 months [95% CI: 7.4–11.1]; hazard ratio [HR]=0.55, 95% CI: 0.45–0.68; p<0.001). OS data showed a trend toward improvement (median OS: 34.7 vs. 28.3 months; HR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.67–1.01; p=0.06). The ORR was higher with abemaciclib (35.1% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001). Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent with abemaciclib (diarrhea: 12.5%; neutropenia: 24.8%) but manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:** Abemaciclib significantly improves PFS and ORR in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer, with a tolerable safety profile. These findings support its use as a standard-of-care option in this patient population.

Breast Cancer	Ado-trastuzumab emtansine	"PMID: 859627. **Abstract**  

**Background:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate combining trastuzumab with the cytotoxic agent emtansine, designed to target HER2-positive breast cancer. Despite advancements in HER2-targeted therapies, resistance and relapse remain significant challenges. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who progressed on prior trastuzumab-based therapy.  

**Methods:** In this phase III, multicenter, open-label trial, 500 patients with HER2-positive MBC were randomized 1:1 to receive T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or physician’s choice of therapy (lapatinib plus capecitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. PFS and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer with T-DM1 (9.6 months [95% CI: 8.4–11.2]) compared to the control arm (6.4 months [95% CI: 5.2–7.1]; HR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52–0.81; p < 0.001). OS also favored T-DM1 (median 30.9 months [95% CI: 27.5–34.3] vs. 25.1 months [95% CI: 22.0–28.4]; HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60–0.89; p = 0.002). ORR was higher in the T-DM1 group (43.5% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.003). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with T-DM1 (42% vs. 57%), with thrombocytopenia (12%) and elevated transaminases (8%) being the most common T-DM1-related toxicities.  

**Conclusion:** T-DM1 significantly improves PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard therapy in HER2-positive MBC, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support T-DM1 as a preferred second-line treatment for this patient population.

PMID: 825979. **Title: Efficacy and Safety of Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2, has emerged as a pivotal therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Despite the success of trastuzumab, resistance and systemic toxicity necessitate improved treatment options. This phase III trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of T-DM1 compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 991 patients with HER2-positive MBC were assigned to receive either T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or lapatinib (1250 mg/day orally) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m² orally twice daily for 14 days). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the T-DM1 group (9.6 months [95% CI: 8.4–10.6]) compared to the lapatinib-capecitabine group (6.4 months [95% CI: 5.4–7.2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, *p* < 0.001). OS was also improved with T-DM1 (median 30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; HR 0.68, *p* = 0.003). The ORR was higher with T-DM1 (43.6% vs. 30.8%, *p* = 0.002). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with T-DM1 (40.8% vs. 57.0%), with thrombocytopenia (12.9%) and elevated transaminases (4.3%) being the most common T-DM1-related toxicities.  

**Discussion:** T-DM1 demonstrated superior efficacy and tolerability over lapatinib-capecitabine, significantly prolonging PFS and OS in HER2-positive MBC. These findings support T-DM1 as a standard-of-care for trastuzumab-pretreated patients, offering a favorable risk-benefit profile. Further studies should explore T-DM1 in earlier disease settings and novel combinations to overcome resistance.

PMID: 306821. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic agent for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), demonstrating significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to conventional therapies. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of T-DM1 in a multicenter, randomized phase III trial involving 498 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had previously received trastuzumab and a taxane. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or physician’s choice of lapatinib plus capecitabine (L+C). The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Median PFS was significantly prolonged in the T-DM1 arm (9.6 months vs. 6.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55–0.77, p < 0.001). OS was also markedly improved with T-DM1 (median 30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.85, p = 0.002). The ORR was higher in the T-DM1 group (43.6% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.008), with a more favorable safety profile, including lower rates of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) (40.8% vs. 57.0%, p < 0.001). The most common AEs with T-DM1 were fatigue (36.2%), nausea (33.5%), and thrombocytopenia (28.7%), whereas L+C was associated with higher incidences of diarrhea (58.3%) and hand-foot syndrome (45.6%). These findings underscore T-DM1 as a superior treatment option for HER2-positive MBC, offering clinically meaningful improvements in survival outcomes and tolerability. The data support its integration into standard care regimens for this patient population, particularly after prior trastuzumab failure. Further studies are warranted to explore T-DM1 in earlier lines of therapy and combination strategies.

PMID: 834682. **Efficacy of Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2, has emerged as a promising therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This study evaluates its efficacy compared to conventional chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in improving progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  

**Population:** A total of 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC, confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH ≥2.0), were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1, stratified by prior trastuzumab use and visceral metastasis status. Median age was 54 years (range 28–75).  

**Intervention:** Patients in the experimental arm (n=262) received T-DM1 at 3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks.  

**Comparison:** The control arm (n=262) received lapatinib (1250 mg/day orally) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m² orally twice daily, days 1–14 of a 21-day cycle).  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was median PFS, which was significantly longer in the T-DM1 group (9.6 months [95% CI 8.4–11.2]) versus the control group (6.4 months [95% CI 5.3–7.5]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.81; p<0.001). Secondary endpoints included OS, with T-DM1 demonstrating a median OS of 30.9 months (95% CI 27.5–34.1) compared to 25.1 months (95% CI 22.3–28.4) in the control group (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61–0.92; p=0.006). Objective response rate (ORR) was higher with T-DM1 (43.5% vs. 30.2%, p=0.003). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with T-DM1 (41% vs. 57%, p=0.002), notably reduced diarrhea (2.3% vs. 21.4%) and hand-foot syndrome (4.2% vs. 17.1%).  

**Conclusion:** T-DM1 significantly improves PFS, OS, and tolerability in HER2-positive MBC, establishing it as a superior therapeutic option. These findings support its integration into first-line treatment regimens.

Breast Cancer	Alpelisib	"PMID: 721197. **Title:** *Efficacy and Safety of Alpelisib in PIK3CA-Mutated, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently dysregulated in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC), with *PIK3CA* mutations present in approximately 40% of cases. Alpelisib, a selective PI3Kα inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical models. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 572 patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC who progressed on prior endocrine therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly prolonged in the alpelisib arm compared to placebo (11.1 months vs. 5.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–0.79; *p* < 0.001). Subgroup analysis confirmed consistent benefit across all predefined subgroups. ORR was higher with alpelisib (35.7% vs. 16.2%; *p* < 0.001). Interim OS data showed a trend toward improvement (median OS 39.3 months vs. 31.4 months; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.01; *p* = 0.06). The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events in the alpelisib arm were hyperglycemia (36.6%), rash (9.9%), and diarrhea (6.7%).  

**Discussion:** Alpelisib plus fulvestrant demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to placebo in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC. These findings support the use of alpelisib as a standard-of-care option in this molecularly defined population. Hyperglycemia and rash were manageable with appropriate monitoring and dose modifications. Further follow-up is required to confirm OS benefit.

PMID: 267465. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Alpelisib in Patients with PIK3CA-Mutated, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial  

**Background:** The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently altered in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer. Alpelisib, a PI3Kα-specific inhibitor, has shown promise in targeting PIK3CA mutations. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib combined with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer.  

**Population:** Patients (n=572) with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who progressed on or after endocrine therapy were enrolled. Median age was 63 years (range 32–89), and 78% had visceral metastases.  

**Intervention:** Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, and 29, then every 28 days) or fulvestrant alone.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received fulvestrant monotherapy. Stratification factors included prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and liver/lung metastases.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was significantly longer in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group (11.1 months [95% CI 9.5–12.9]) versus fulvestrant alone (5.7 months [95% CI 3.7–7.4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.53–0.79; p<0.001). Objective response rate was 35.7% vs. 16.2% (p<0.001), and clinical benefit rate was 61.5% vs. 45.3% (p=0.002). Common grade ≥3 adverse events in the alpelisib group included hyperglycemia (36.6%), rash (9.9%), and diarrhea (6.7%).  

**Conclusion:** Alpelisib significantly improved PFS and response rates in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, establishing it as a clinically meaningful therapeutic option. The safety profile was manageable with appropriate monitoring.

Alpelisib, a PI3Kα-specific inhibitor, has shown promise in targeting PIK3CA-mutated tumors. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer.  

**Population:** This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial enrolled 572 patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed on or after endocrine therapy. Eligible participants were stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either alpelisib (300 mg orally once daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Comparison:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Outcomes:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the alpelisib group (11.1 months; 95% CI, 9.1–13.8) compared to the placebo group (5.7 months; 95% CI, 4.5–7.4), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.52–0.81; p < 0.001). The ORR was 35.7% in the alpelisib arm versus 16.2% in the placebo arm (p < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69–1.08; p = 0.15). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events in the alpelisib group were hyperglycemia (36.6%), rash (9.9%), and diarrhea (6.7%).  

**Conclusion:** Alpelisib significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, establishing it as a valuable therapeutic option in this population. The safety profile was manageable with appropriate monitoring.

PMID: 568760. **Title:** Efficacy of Alpelisib in PIK3CA-Mutated, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial  

**Abstract**  

**Background:** The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently dysregulated in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC), with *PIK3CA* mutations occurring in approximately 40% of cases. Alpelisib, a selective PI3Kα inhibitor, has shown promise in targeting this pathway. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC.  

**Population:** Patients (n=572) with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC who progressed on or after endocrine therapy were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG performance status ≤1.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 4 weeks thereafter) or fulvestrant alone.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received fulvestrant monotherapy. Stratification factors included visceral metastasis and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). At median follow-up of 20.3 months, the alpelisib-fulvestrant group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to fulvestrant alone (median PFS 11.0 vs. 5.7 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.81, *p*<0.001). Objective response rate (ORR) was higher with alpelisib (35.7% vs. 16.2%, *p*<0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefit across all predefined groups, including those with visceral metastases (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53–0.85). The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events in the alpelisib arm were hyperglycemia (36.6%) and rash (9.9%).  

**Conclusion:** Alpelisib significantly improves PFS and ORR in *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC, establishing it as a targeted therapeutic option for this population. Monitoring and management of hyperglycemia are essential for optimal treatment adherence.

PMID: 474798. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Alpelisib in PIK3CA-Mutated, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently dysregulated in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer, with *PIK3CA* mutations occurring in approximately 40% of cases. Alpelisib, a PI3Kα-selective inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its clinical impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced disease remains under investigation. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial, 572 patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated tumors were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test (two-sided α = 0.05).  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the alpelisib group (11.1 months [95% CI: 9.5–12.9]) compared to the placebo group (5.7 months [95% CI: 4.5–7.4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53–0.79; *p* < 0.001). ORR was 35.7% versus 16.2% (*p* < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.69–1.07; *p* = 0.15). Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with alpelisib (63.4% vs. 29.6%), primarily hyperglycemia (36.9%) and rash (9.9%).  

**Conclusion:** Alpelisib significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, though with increased toxicity. These findings support its use as a targeted therapy in this molecularly defined population. Further follow-up is needed to assess long-term OS benefits.

Breast Cancer	Anastrozole	"PMID: 105336. **Title:** Efficacy of Anastrozole in Adjuvant Treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy of anastrozole, a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, compared to tamoxifen in improving disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer.  

**Design:** Multicenter, phase III, randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted between January 2015 and December 2022. Patients were stratified by nodal status and prior chemotherapy.  

**Participants:** A total of 2,436 postmenopausal women with stage I-III HR+ breast cancer were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positivity, and completion of primary therapy (surgery ± chemotherapy).  

**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either anastrozole 1 mg/day (n=1,218) or tamoxifen 20 mg/day (n=1,218) for 5 years.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoints were DFS and OS. Secondary endpoints included time to distant recurrence (TTDR), contralateral breast cancer incidence, and safety profile.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 72 months, anastrozole demonstrated superior DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.2% vs. 78.6%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61–0.85; p<0.001). OS was also significantly improved in the anastrozole group (91.4% vs. 87.3%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65–0.96; p=0.018). TTDR was longer with anastrozole (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.86; p=0.002), and the incidence of contralateral breast cancer was lower (1.2% vs. 2.7%; p=0.012). Anastrozole was associated with fewer thromboembolic events (3.1% vs. 6.8%; p<0.001) but higher rates of arthralgia (29.4% vs. 18.2%; p<0.001) and osteoporosis (12.5% vs. 7.3%; p<0.001).  

**Conclusions:** Anastrozole significantly improves DFS and OS in postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer compared to tamoxifen, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support its use as a first-line adjuvant endocrine therapy in this population.

PMID: 851559. Anastrozole, a potent third-generation aromatase inhibitor, has demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. This large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the impact of anastrozole (1 mg/day) on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 3,124 postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer over a median follow-up period of 10.2 years. Patients receiving anastrozole exhibited a statistically significant improvement in DFS compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.69; p < 0.001), with a 5-year DFS rate of 89.4% versus 78.6% in the placebo arm. Similarly, OS was markedly enhanced in the anastrozole cohort (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61–0.85; p = 0.002), with a 10-year OS rate of 82.1% compared to 74.3% in the control group. Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across all predefined strata, including nodal status and tumor size. Adverse events were manageable, with the most common being arthralgia (28.7% vs. 21.4% in placebo) and hot flashes (24.5% vs. 18.9%), while serious adverse events such as fractures (5.2% vs. 4.1%) and cardiovascular events (3.8% vs. 3.5%) did not differ significantly between groups. These findings underscore anastrozole as a cornerstone therapy for HR+ breast cancer, offering robust improvements in long-term outcomes with a favorable safety profile. The data support its use as first-line adjuvant therapy in this patient population, reinforcing its role in reducing recurrence and mortality rates. Further studies are warranted to explore optimal treatment duration and combinatorial strategies with emerging targeted therapies.

PMID: 498128. **Title:** Efficacy of Anastrozole in Hormone Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Abstract**  

**Background:** Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, are a cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. However, robust comparative data on long-term outcomes remain critical for clinical decision-making.  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in improving disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, 3,124 postmenopausal women with stage I–III HR+ breast cancer were enrolled between 2010 and 2015. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either anastrozole (1 mg/day, n=1,562) or tamoxifen (20 mg/day, n=1,562) for 5 years. Primary endpoints were DFS and OS, with secondary endpoints including time to recurrence (TTR) and safety. Median follow-up was 8.2 years.  

**Results:** Anastrozole significantly improved DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.3% vs. 78.6%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61–0.85; p<0.001). OS was also superior in the anastrozole group (89.1% vs. 84.4%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.94; p=0.008). The 5-year TTR was lower with anastrozole (9.2% vs. 14.7%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53–0.77; p<0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across age, tumor size, and nodal status. Adverse events were manageable, with anastrozole associated with fewer thromboembolic events (2.1% vs. 5.3%, p<0.001) but more arthralgia (28.4% vs. 18.9%, p<0.001).  

**Conclusion:** Anastrozole demonstrates superior efficacy over tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer, significantly improving DFS, OS, and TTR with a favorable safety profile. These findings support its use as first-line adjuvant therapy in this population.

**Abstract**  

**Background:** Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, are a cornerstone of adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer. However, the comparative efficacy of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in improving long-term outcomes remains a critical area of investigation.  

**Population:** This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial enrolled 1,524 postmenopausal women with HR+ early-stage breast cancer (T1-3, N0-1, M0) between January 2010 and December 2015. Participants were stratified by nodal status and tumor size.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either anastrozole 1 mg daily (n = 762) or tamoxifen 20 mg daily (n = 762) for 5 years as adjuvant therapy.  

**Comparison:** The primary comparison was anastrozole versus tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profiles.  

**Outcomes:** At a median follow-up of 96 months, anastrozole demonstrated superior DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.2% vs. 78.6%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58–0.87, p = 0.001). OS was also significantly improved in the anastrozole group (91.4% vs. 86.3%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62–0.94, p = 0.012). The incidence of contralateral breast cancer was lower with anastrozole (1.8% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.03). Adverse events were consistent with known profiles, with anastrozole associated with higher rates of arthralgia (29.1% vs. 18.4%, p < 0.001) but fewer thromboembolic events (2.3% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.002).  

**Conclusion:** Anastrozole significantly improves DFS and OS compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer, supporting its use as a first-line adjuvant therapy. These findings reinforce the importance of aromatase inhibition in optimizing long-term outcomes for this population.

PMID: 754574. Anastrozole, a potent third-generation aromatase inhibitor, has demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. This study evaluated the impact of anastrozole on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in a large, randomized controlled trial involving 2,548 postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer. Patients were randomized to receive either anastrozole (1 mg/day) or tamoxifen (20 mg/day) as adjuvant therapy for five years. The primary endpoint was DFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, time to recurrence (TTR), and safety profile. After a median follow-up of 120 months, anastrozole significantly improved DFS compared to tamoxifen (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.82; p < 0.001), with an absolute difference of 5.8% at 10 years (78.2% vs. 72.4%). OS was also superior in the anastrozole group (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96; p = 0.012), with a 10-year survival rate of 84.5% versus 80.1% for tamoxifen. The TTR was significantly prolonged with anastrozole (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59–0.78; p < 0.001), reflecting a 32% reduction in recurrence risk. Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across all predefined strata, including nodal status and tumor size. Adverse events were manageable, with anastrozole associated with fewer thromboembolic events (2.1% vs. 4.8%; p < 0.001) but a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms (28.5% vs. 20.3%; p < 0.001) compared to tamoxifen. These findings underscore anastrozole as a superior adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal HR+ breast cancer, offering significant improvements in long-term outcomes with a favorable safety profile. The data support its use as a first-line treatment in this patient population, reinforcing its role in reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality."	86	0.334	0.0312	0.751
Breast Cancer	Capivasertib	"PMID: 187109. **Title: Capivasertib Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:**  
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently dysregulated in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, contributing to endocrine therapy resistance. Capivasertib, a potent AKT inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in overcoming this resistance. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of capivasertib combined with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer following progression on aromatase inhibitors.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 562 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled and stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly, per standard dosing) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided α of 0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the capivasertib-fulvestrant group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo-fulvestrant group (7.5 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.81; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefit across all prespecified subgroups, including those with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53–0.87). ORR was significantly higher in the capivasertib arm (28.4% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.002). Interim OS data showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64–1.05; p = 0.11). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events in the capivasertib group were hyperglycemia (12.3%) and rash (8.7%), with manageable toxicity profiles.  

**Conclusion:**  
Capivasertib combined with fulvestrant significantly improved PFS in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, with a clinically meaningful and statistically robust treatment benefit. These findings support capivasertib as a promising therapeutic option in this population, particularly for those with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-altered tumors. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term survival outcomes.

**Abstract**  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of capivasertib, a potent AKT inhibitor, in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who progressed on prior endocrine therapy.  

**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis status.  

**Participants:** A total of 562 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled across 120 sites in 15 countries. Eligible participants had progressed on or after endocrine therapy, with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  

**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive capivasertib (400 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 4 weeks thereafter) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the capivasertib-fulvestrant group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to the placebo-fulvestrant group (median PFS: 12.4 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.73; p < 0.001). The ORR was 32.1% (95% CI 26.5–38.2) in the capivasertib arm versus 15.7% (95% CI 11.4–20.9) in the placebo arm (p < 0.001). CBR was 64.3% vs. 42.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). OS data were immature but showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60–1.04; p = 0.09). Grade ≥3 adverse events were more common with capivasertib (48.2% vs. 28.6%), primarily hyperglycemia (12.4%) and rash (9.1%).  

**Conclusions:** Capivasertib significantly prolongs PFS and enhances tumor response in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, supporting its use as a novel therapeutic option in this population. The safety profile was manageable, with no new toxicities identified.

PMID: 860015. Capivasertib, a potent and selective inhibitor of AKT kinase, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, particularly in patients with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway alterations. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of capivasertib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. A total of 562 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly every 28 days) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. At a median follow-up of 18.5 months, the capivasertib arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to the placebo arm (median PFS 7.4 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–0.80; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent PFS benefits across predefined subgroups, including those with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations (median PFS 9.3 vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44–0.76; p < 0.001). Overall survival data were immature but showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64–1.05; p = 0.11). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events in the capivasertib arm were hyperglycemia (12.1%), diarrhea (8.7%), and rash (7.4%), with discontinuation rates due to adverse events being 8.9% versus 3.2% in the placebo arm. These results establish capivasertib as a clinically meaningful addition to fulvestrant, significantly improving outcomes for patients with HR+ advanced breast cancer, particularly those harboring PI3K/AKT pathway alterations. The safety profile was manageable, supporting its use in this patient population.

Breast Cancer	Elacestrant	"PMID: 304457. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Elacestrant in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer remains a therapeutic challenge, particularly after progression on prior endocrine therapies. Elacestrant, a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study evaluates its efficacy and safety compared to standard-of-care endocrine monotherapy.  

**Population:** Postmenopausal women (n=478) with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapy and 1–2 lines of endocrine treatment.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral Elacestrant (400 mg daily) or investigator’s choice of standard endocrine therapy (fulvestrant 500 mg or aromatase inhibitor).  

**Comparison:** Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed as the primary endpoint, with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Outcomes:** Elacestrant demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to standard therapy (5.7 months vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.86; p=0.002). Subgroup analyses showed consistent benefit across prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure and metastatic sites. The 12-month PFS rate was 22.3% for Elacestrant versus 9.1% for standard therapy (p<0.001). ORR was 12.4% vs. 6.7% (p=0.03). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were manageable, with nausea (27%) and fatigue (18%) being most common. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 25% of Elacestrant-treated patients versus 21% in the control arm.  

**Conclusion:** Elacestrant significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after CDK4/6 inhibitor failure, establishing it as a promising therapeutic option. These findings support its integration into the treatment paradigm for endocrine-resistant disease.

PMID: 497111. **Title: Elacestrant Demonstrates Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival and Overall Response Rates in Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:**  
Elacestrant, a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has emerged as a promising therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, particularly in patients with ESR1 mutations who exhibit resistance to prior endocrine therapies. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of elacestrant compared to standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine monotherapy in this patient population.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, open-label trial, 478 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy + CDK4/6 inhibitors were randomized 1:1 to receive either elacestrant (345 mg orally daily) or SOC (fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly or aromatase inhibitor). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. ESR1 mutation status was assessed via circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Statistical analysis employed Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  

**Results:**  
At a median follow-up of 14.2 months, elacestrant significantly improved median PFS compared to SOC (5.7 months vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–0.75; p < 0.001). In the ESR1-mutated subgroup (n = 228), the benefit was more pronounced (median PFS 7.1 months vs. 2.8 months; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32–0.63; p < 0.001). ORR was higher with elacestrant (12.4% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.003). Grade ≥3 adverse events were comparable (23% vs. 21%), with nausea (27%) and fatigue (18%) being the most common in the elacestrant arm.  

**Discussion:**  
Elacestrant demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and ORR over SOC, particularly in ESR1-mutated tumors, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support elacestrant as a new standard of care for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, especially in patients with endocrine resistance driven by ESR1 mutations. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and combination regimens.

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Elacestrant, a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has emerged as a promising therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, particularly in patients with ESR1 mutations who progress on prior endocrine therapy. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of elacestrant compared to standard-of-care endocrine therapy in this patient population.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, 478 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either elacestrant (345 mg orally once daily) or investigator’s choice of fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or aromatase inhibitor (AI). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. ESR1 mutation status was analyzed in circulating tumor DNA.  

**Results:** At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, elacestrant significantly improved PFS compared to standard therapy (median PFS: 5.7 vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.80; p < 0.001). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with ESR1 mutations (median PFS: 6.8 vs. 2.1 months; HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32–0.63; p < 0.001). ORR was higher with elacestrant (12.4% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.03). OS data were immature but trended favorably (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.62–1.08; p = 0.15). The most common adverse events with elacestrant were nausea (32%), fatigue (24%), and arthralgia (18%), with no new safety signals identified.  

**Discussion:** Elacestrant demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS over standard endocrine therapy, particularly in ESR1-mutated tumors, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support elacestrant as a new standard of care for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and combination strategies.

**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer remains a clinical challenge due to endocrine resistance. Elacestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has shown promise in preclinical studies by effectively targeting ESR1 mutations. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of elacestrant compared to standard endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, 478 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior ET and CDK4/6 inhibitors were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either elacestrant (345 mg orally daily) or investigator’s choice of fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or aromatase inhibitor (AI). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).

Breast Cancer	Everolimus	"PMID: 617405. **Title: Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer often develops resistance to endocrine therapy, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in overcoming endocrine resistance. This phase III trial evaluated the addition of everolimus to standard endocrine therapy in patients with advanced HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 724 patients with metastatic or locally advanced HR+ breast cancer progressing on prior aromatase inhibitors were randomized (1:1) to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the everolimus arm (7.8 months [95% CI: 7.2–9.1]) compared to the placebo arm (3.2 months [95% CI: 2.8–4.1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, *p* < 0.001). The 12-month PFS rate was 32.4% vs. 12.1% (*p* < 0.001). ORR was higher with everolimus (12.6% vs. 5.4%, *p* = 0.002). OS data were immature at interim analysis but showed a trend favoring everolimus (HR 0.78, *p* = 0.06). Grade 3/4 adverse events (e.g., stomatitis [8%], hyperglycemia [5%]) were more frequent with everolimus but manageable.  

**Conclusion:** Everolimus combined with exemestane significantly improves PFS in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer, supporting its role in overcoming endocrine resistance. These findings underscore the clinical benefit of mTOR inhibition in this population, warranting further investigation into predictive biomarkers for optimal patient selection.

PMID: 948844. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy for Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) for patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on prior ET.  

**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by prior chemotherapy use and visceral metastasis status.  

**Participants:** A total of 582 postmenopausal women with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer were enrolled across 87 sites. Eligible participants had documented progression on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) and were randomized 1:1 to receive everolimus (n=291) or placebo (n=291), both in combination with exemestane.  

**Interventions:** Patients received either everolimus (10 mg/day orally) plus exemestane (25 mg/day orally) or placebo plus exemestane until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the everolimus arm (7.8 months; 95% CI, 6.9–9.1) compared to the placebo arm (3.2 months; 95% CI, 2.8–4.1; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45; p<0.001). ORR was 12.4% vs. 4.8% (p=0.002), and CBR was 51.2% vs. 25.8% (p<0.001) in the everolimus and placebo arms, respectively. OS data were immature at the time of analysis. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with everolimus (43.6% vs. 19.2%), primarily stomatitis (9.3%), hyperglycemia (6.5%), and pneumonitis (4.1%).  

**Conclusions:** Everolimus significantly improves PFS and clinical benefit when added to exemestane in patients with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer, despite a higher incidence of grade 3/4 AEs. These findings support the use of everolimus as a standard therapeutic option in this population.

PMID: 571152. **Title: Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype of breast cancer, but resistance to endocrine therapy remains a major clinical challenge. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in overcoming endocrine resistance. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with standard endocrine therapy in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 750 postmenopausal women with advanced HR+/HER2− breast cancer who had progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy were randomized (1:1) to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24 months, the everolimus-exemestane group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo-exemestane group (11.5 vs. 6.8 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53–0.79, *p* < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the everolimus arm (28.4% vs. 12.1%, *p* = 0.002). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent PFS benefits across all predefined strata. OS data were immature but showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64–1.05, *p* = 0.12). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events in the everolimus group were stomatitis (12%), hyperglycemia (9%), and pneumonitis (6%).  

**Conclusion:** The addition of everolimus to exemestane significantly prolongs PFS in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer, supporting its role as a standard therapeutic option in this setting. While toxicity was higher than with endocrine therapy alone, the clinical benefit outweighs the risks. These findings underscore the importance of mTOR inhibition in overcoming endocrine resistance.

PMID: 447059. **Title: Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Introduction:**  
Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer remains the most common subtype of breast cancer, and resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) poses a significant clinical challenge. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown promise in overcoming ET resistance by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with ET in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer.  

**Methods:**  
A total of 550 postmenopausal women with advanced HR+/HER2− breast cancer who had progressed on prior ET were randomized (1:1) to receive either everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 24 months, the everolimus-exemestane group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo-exemestane group (11.3 vs. 5.8 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47–0.72; p < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the everolimus arm (28.5% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.002). While OS data remain immature, a trend toward benefit was observed (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65–1.03; p = 0.09). Grade 3/4 adverse events, including stomatitis (12.4%) and hyperglycemia (8.7%), were more frequent with everolimus but manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Discussion:**  
This study confirms that everolimus significantly enhances PFS in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer when combined with ET, providing a clinically meaningful therapeutic option for ET-resistant disease. The safety profile was consistent with prior reports, supporting the feasibility of long-term use. These findings reinforce the role of mTOR inhibition in overcoming endocrine resistance and warrant further investigation into predictive biomarkers for patient selection.

**Background:** The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promise in overcoming endocrine resistance in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with standard endocrine therapy (ET) compared to ET alone in patients with advanced disease.  

**Population:** A total of 542 postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally advanced HR+, HER2-negative breast cancer who progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy were enrolled. Median age was 62 years (range: 38–79), and 68% had visceral metastases.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) (n = 271) or placebo plus exemestane (n = 271). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received placebo plus exemestane. Stratification factors included prior chemotherapy and visceral metastasis status.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was significantly longer in the everolimus arm (7.8 months [95% CI: 6.9–8.5]) versus the placebo arm (3.2 months [95% CI: 2.8–3.9]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI: 0.36–0.56; p < 0.001). Objective response rate (ORR) was 12.6% with everolimus versus 5.4% with placebo (p = 0.002). Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 51.3% versus 26.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Grade 3/4 adverse events (e.g., stomatitis [8%], hyperglycemia [5%], pneumonitis [3%]) were more frequent with everolimus but manageable.  

**Conclusion:** Everolimus significantly improves PFS and clinical outcomes when added to endocrine therapy in advanced HR+ breast cancer, supporting its role as a standard treatment option in this population. Further studies are warranted to optimize patient selection and mitigate toxicity.

Breast Cancer	Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki	"PMID: 215488. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a therapeutic challenge despite advances in targeted therapies. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combining a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of T-DXd compared to standard-of-care therapies in HER2-positive MBC.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received ≥2 prior HER2-directed regimens were randomized 2:1 to receive T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or physician’s choice of therapy (trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib plus capecitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 16.2 months, T-DXd demonstrated superior PFS compared to the control arm (median PFS: 16.8 vs. 6.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.58; *p* < 0.001). OS data were immature but showed a trend favoring T-DXd (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.95; *p* = 0.018). The confirmed ORR was 62.5% (95% CI 56.8–68.0) in the T-DXd group versus 28.3% (95% CI 21.5–35.9) in the control group (*p* < 0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 52.1% of T-DXd-treated patients (most commonly neutropenia [19.4%] and fatigue [10.2%]), with interstitial lung disease (ILD) reported in 10.5% (2.7% grade ≥3).  

**Conclusion:** T-DXd significantly improved PFS and ORR compared to standard therapies in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC, establishing a new benchmark for efficacy. While manageable, the risk of ILD warrants careful monitoring. These findings support T-DXd as a preferred therapeutic option in this population.

PMID: 260416. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Despite advances in HER2-targeted therapies, a significant proportion of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) experience disease progression. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd compared to standard-of-care therapies in HER2-positive MBC.  

**Methods:** In this open-label, multicenter, phase III trial, 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received ≥2 prior HER2-directed regimens were randomized 1:1 to receive T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or physician’s choice of therapy (trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib plus capecitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, T-DXd demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to the control arm (median PFS: 16.8 vs. 6.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.58; p < 0.001). OS data were immature but favored T-DXd (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.95; p = 0.02). The ORR was significantly higher with T-DXd (67.1% vs. 30.9%; p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 12.4% of T-DXd patients versus 2.1% in the control group. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 52.3% of T-DXd patients (most commonly neutropenia [19.8%] and fatigue [10.2%]) versus 49.7% in the control arm. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) of any grade occurred in 10.5% of T-DXd patients (2.1% Grade ≥3).  

**Conclusion:** T-DXd significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard therapies in HER2-positive MBC, establishing it as a superior treatment option in this population. While manageable, vigilance for ILD is warranted. These findings support the use of T-DXd as a new standard of care for refractory HER2-positive MBC.

**Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have progressed on prior anti-HER2 therapies.  

**Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial comparing T-DXd to physician’s choice of treatment (lapatinib plus capecitabine or trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1]). Patients were stratified by prior T-DM1 use and visceral metastasis status.  

**Participants**: A total of 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled across 87 sites. Eligible participants had received ≥2 prior anti-HER2 regimens and had measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  

**Interventions**: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or control therapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Main Outcome Measures**: Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results**: Median PFS was significantly longer with T-DXd (16.8 months [95% CI, 14.5–19.5]) vs. control (6.9 months [95% CI, 5.5–8.3]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.29–0.49; p < 0.0001). ORR was 62.3% (95% CI, 56.1–68.2) with T-DXd vs. 24.7% (95% CI, 19.2–30.8) with control (p < 0.001). Interim OS analysis favored T-DXd (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47–0.87; p = 0.003). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 52.1% of T-DXd patients (vs. 48.9% control), with interstitial lung disease (13.6%) being the most notable T-DXd-related toxicity.  

**Conclusions**: T-DXd demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and ORR compared to standard therapies in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC, establishing it as a superior treatment option. Vigilance for pulmonary toxicity is warranted.

PMID: 722292. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2, a key driver in aggressive breast cancer subtypes. This study evaluated its efficacy compared to standard therapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.  

**Population:** Eligible participants (n=524) were adults with HER2-positive MBC (IHC 3+ or ISH-positive) who had received ≥2 prior anti-HER2 regimens. Patients were randomized 1:1 to T-DXd or physician’s choice of therapy (trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib plus capecitabine).  

**Intervention:** Patients received T-DXd intravenously (5.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received standard therapies (trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg q3w or lapatinib 1250 mg/day plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m² BID).  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI: 14.1–19.5) with T-DXd versus 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.5–8.3) in the control arm (HR 0.36; 95% CI: 0.28–0.47; p<0.0001). OS data showed a significant improvement (median not reached vs. 17.5 months; HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42–0.73; p=0.0002). ORR was 62.3% (95% CI: 56.5–67.8) with T-DXd versus 26.7% (95% CI: 21.2–32.8) in controls (p<0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 52.1% of T-DXd patients (vs. 48.9% controls), with interstitial lung disease (13.6%) being the most notable T-DXd-related toxicity.  

**Conclusion:** T-DXd demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard therapies, establishing it as a superior treatment option for HER2-positive MBC.

PMID: 671546. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd) has emerged as a transformative therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), demonstrating significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to standard treatments. In the phase III DESTINY-Breast03 trial, 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane were randomized to receive either T-DXd or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary endpoint, median PFS assessed by blinded independent central review, was not reached in the T-DXd arm (95% CI, 18.5–not estimable) versus 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6–8.2) in the T-DM1 arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22–0.37; p < 0.0001). At 12 months, the PFS rate was 75.8% (95% CI, 69.8–80.7) for T-DXd versus 34.1% (95% CI, 27.7–40.5) for T-DM1. Interim OS analysis also favored T-DXd, with a 12-month survival rate of 94.1% (95% CI, 90.3–96.4) versus 85.9% (95% CI, 80.9–89.7) for T-DM1 (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36–0.86; p = 0.007). Objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher with T-DXd (79.7% [95% CI, 74.3–84.4]) versus T-DM1 (34.2% [95% CI, 28.5–40.3]; p < 0.0001), with complete responses observed in 16.1% versus 8.7% of patients, respectively. The safety profile of T-DXd was manageable, with interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurring in 10.5% of patients (grade ≥3 in 2.6%). These data establish T-DXd as a superior second-line therapy for HER2-positive MBC, with unprecedented efficacy and durable responses, underscoring its potential to redefine treatment paradigms. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and HER2-low breast cancer."	69	0.105	0.0147	0.429
Breast Cancer	Lapatinib	"PMID: 939314. **Title:** Efficacy of Lapatinib in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2 and EGFR, in combination with capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with trastuzumab.  

**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial. Patients were stratified by prior trastuzumab response and metastatic site involvement.  

**Participants:** A total of 399 women with HER2-positive MBC, confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH+), were enrolled. Participants had progressive disease after trastuzumab-based therapy and an ECOG performance status of 0–2.  

**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either lapatinib (1250 mg orally daily) plus capecitabine (2000 mg/m² orally on days 1–14 of a 21-day cycle) or capecitabine alone (2500 mg/m² on the same schedule). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the lapatinib group (8.4 months [95% CI: 7.2–9.6]) compared to the capecitabine-alone group (4.4 months [95% CI: 3.6–5.1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI: 0.38–0.63; p < 0.001). ORR was 23.7% (95% CI: 18.3–29.1%) in the lapatinib arm versus 13.9% (95% CI: 9.4–18.4%) in the control arm (p = 0.009). Median OS trended toward improvement (18.6 vs. 15.3 months, HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.64–1.05; p = 0.11). Grade 3/4 adverse events, including diarrhea (12.5% vs. 3.2%) and hand-foot syndrome (8.6% vs. 14.3%), were manageable.  

**Conclusions:** Lapatinib significantly improves PFS and ORR in HER2-positive MBC patients after trastuzumab failure, supporting its role as a second-line therapeutic option. The combination was well-tolerated, with a predictable safety profile. These findings underscore the clinical benefit of dual HER2/EGFR inhibition in refractory disease.

PMID: 547183. **Title:** Efficacy of Lapatinib in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:**  
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2 and EGFR, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine compared to capecitabine alone in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who had progressed on prior trastuzumab-based therapy.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase III trial, 399 patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled and stratified by prior therapy and metastatic site. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either Lapatinib (1250 mg/day) plus capecitabine (2000 mg/m²/day) or capecitabine alone (2500 mg/m²/day). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 48 weeks, the Lapatinib-capecitabine group demonstrated significantly longer median PFS (8.4 months vs. 4.4 months; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37–0.65, *p* < 0.001) and higher ORR (35% vs. 18%, *p* = 0.003) compared to capecitabine alone. OS data showed a trend toward improvement (median OS 15.6 vs. 12.8 months; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–1.00, *p* = 0.053). Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent in the combination arm (65% vs. 52%), primarily diarrhea (12%) and hand-foot syndrome (14%), but were manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:**  
Lapatinib significantly improves PFS and ORR in HER2-positive MBC patients refractory to trastuzumab, establishing its role as a valuable second-line therapy. The combination with capecitabine offers a clinically meaningful benefit, though careful toxicity monitoring is warranted. These findings support the integration of Lapatinib into standard treatment paradigms for advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

PMID: 740333. **Title:** *Efficacy of Lapatinib in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial*  

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2 and EGFR, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Despite the success of trastuzumab, resistance and disease progression remain significant challenges. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with capecitabine compared to capecitabine alone in HER2-positive MBC patients.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, phase III trial, 399 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had progressed on prior trastuzumab-based therapy were enrolled. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either lapatinib (1250 mg/day) plus capecitabine (2000 mg/m²/day) or capecitabine alone (2500 mg/m²/day). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:** The combination of lapatinib and capecitabine significantly improved PFS compared to capecitabine alone (median PFS: 8.4 vs. 4.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.65; *p* < 0.001). OS also favored the lapatinib arm (median OS: 17.1 vs. 14.3 months; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99; *p* = 0.043). The ORR was higher in the combination group (22.5% vs. 14.3%, *p* = 0.027). Adverse events were manageable, with diarrhea (60.2%) and hand-foot syndrome (45.1%) being the most common in the lapatinib arm.  

**Discussion:** Lapatinib combined with capecitabine demonstrates significant clinical benefit in HER2-positive MBC, improving PFS, OS, and ORR compared to capecitabine alone. These findings support the use of lapatinib as a standard therapeutic option for trastuzumab-refractory HER2-positive MBC. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier disease settings and novel combinations.

Breast Cancer	Margetuximab	"PMID: 324543. Margetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), particularly in patients with refractory disease. This phase III, randomized, open-label study (NCT04262804) evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 18.7 months, margetuximab significantly improved PFS with a median of 5.8 months (95% CI: 5.5–6.9) versus 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.2–5.6) in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62–0.94; p=0.012). OS data, though immature, showed a trend toward benefit with margetuximab (median OS 21.6 months vs. 19.8 months; HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67–1.06; p=0.14). The ORR was 35.4% (95% CI: 30.1–40.9) in the margetuximab group versus 28.6% (95% CI: 23.5–34.1) in the trastuzumab group (p=0.048). Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced efficacy in patients with CD16A-158F alleles, supporting the immunomodulatory mechanism of margetuximab’s optimized Fc domain. Treatment-related adverse events were comparable between arms, with grade ≥3 events occurring in 48.2% of margetuximab-treated patients versus 45.9% in the trastuzumab group. These findings establish margetuximab as a superior therapeutic option for HER2-positive MBC, particularly in heavily pretreated populations, with statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR, underscoring its potential to redefine standard care in this setting. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and combinatorial regimens.

PMID: 897998. Margetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), particularly in patients with refractory disease. This phase III, randomized, open-label study (SOPHIA trial, NCT02492711) evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies. The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review, was significantly improved in the margetuximab arm (median PFS 5.8 months vs. 4.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.98, p=0.033). Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced benefit in patients carrying the CD16A-158F allele (median PFS 6.9 months vs. 5.1 months; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52–0.90, p=0.005), underscoring the role of Fc optimization in improving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Secondary endpoints, including overall response rate (ORR), favored margetuximab (22% vs. 16%, p=0.06), with a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) at interim analysis (median OS 21.6 months vs. 19.8 months; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69–1.13, p=0.33). Safety profiles were comparable between arms, with infusion-related reactions (13% vs. 3%) being more frequent with margetuximab but largely manageable. These findings establish margetuximab as a promising therapeutic option for HER2-positive MBC, particularly in patients with limited treatment alternatives, and highlight the importance of Fc receptor polymorphism in predicting clinical response. The study supports further investigation of margetuximab in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with novel HER2-targeted agents.

Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced benefit in patients with CD16A-158F alleles, consistent with margetuximab’s optimized Fc-mediated immune effector function. Treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between arms, with grade ≥3 events occurring in 54.2% of margetuximab-treated patients versus 51.8% in the trastuzumab group. These findings establish margetuximab as a superior therapeutic option for HER2-positive MBC, offering clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and ORR with a manageable safety profile, particularly in heavily pretreated populations. Further studies are warranted to explore its potential in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with other targeted agents.

PMID: 309934. **Title: Margetuximab Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival and Overall Response Rates in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:** Despite advancements in HER2-targeted therapies, a significant proportion of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) experience disease progression. Margetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and may offer superior clinical benefits compared to existing therapies. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with pretreated HER2-positive MBC.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior trastuzumab and pertuzumab were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg q3w) plus chemotherapy (n=268) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg q3w) plus chemotherapy (n=268). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the margetuximab arm (6.9 months [95% CI: 5.8–8.2]) compared to the trastuzumab arm (5.1 months [95% CI: 4.1–5.6]; hazard ratio [HR]=0.71, 95% CI: 0.58–0.86; p=0.0006). The ORR was 35.8% (95% CI: 30.1–41.9) for margetuximab versus 28.6% (95% CI: 23.3–34.4; p=0.03) for trastuzumab. A trend toward improved OS was observed (median OS: 21.6 vs. 19.2 months; HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.67–1.03; p=0.09). Grade ≥3 adverse events were comparable between arms (48.5% vs. 46.7%).  

**Conclusion:** Margetuximab significantly improved PFS and ORR compared to trastuzumab in patients with pretreated HER2-positive MBC, demonstrating clinically meaningful efficacy with a manageable safety profile. These findings support margetuximab as a promising therapeutic option for this population.

Breast Cancer	Neratinib	"PMID: 125210. Neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for HER2-positive and HER2-mutated breast cancer, demonstrating significant improvements in patient outcomes. This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of neratinib versus placebo in 1,240 women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral neratinib 240 mg daily or placebo for 12 months. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) at 5 years, with secondary endpoints including distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and overall survival (OS). At a median follow-up of 60 months, neratinib significantly improved iDFS compared to placebo (88.5% vs. 81.2%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.85; p = 0.001). DRFS was also superior in the neratinib arm (90.1% vs. 83.4%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47–0.81; p = 0.0003), while a trend toward improved OS was observed (93.6% vs. 91.2%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58–1.07; p = 0.12). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent benefits across hormone receptor status and nodal involvement. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were diarrhea (28.5% neratinib vs. 2.1% placebo) and fatigue (4.3% vs. 1.7%), which were manageable with prophylactic loperamide and dose modifications. Quality-of-life metrics, assessed via EORTC QLQ-C30, showed transient declines during active treatment but returned to baseline by 12 months. These findings establish neratinib as a highly effective extended adjuvant therapy, providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in recurrence risk for HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Further studies are warranted to optimize patient selection and mitigate gastrointestinal toxicity.

PMID: 981037. Neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, demonstrating significant improvements in patient outcomes. This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of neratinib versus placebo in 1,240 patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), with secondary endpoints including distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and overall survival (OS). After a median follow-up of 60 months, neratinib significantly improved iDFS, with a 5-year iDFS rate of 90.2% (95% CI: 88.1–92.3) compared to 85.6% (95% CI: 83.2–88.0) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59–0.90; p=0.004). DRFS was also enhanced with neratinib, showing a 5-year rate of 92.8% (95% CI: 91.0–94.6) versus 88.4% (95% CI: 86.2–90.6) for placebo (HR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.51–0.85; p=0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent benefits across HR+ and HR- cohorts, though the magnitude of effect was more pronounced in HR+ patients (iDFS HR 0.65; p=0.002). The most common adverse events were grade 1–2 diarrhea (93.2% neratinib vs. 35.4% placebo), managed with prophylactic loperamide. Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 28.5% of neratinib-treated patients versus 10.2% in the placebo group, with no treatment-related deaths. These findings establish neratinib as a highly effective adjuvant therapy, significantly reducing recurrence risk and improving long-term outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer, particularly in HR+ subgroups, warranting its inclusion in standard treatment paradigms. Further studies are ongoing to optimize dosing strategies and mitigate gastrointestinal toxicity.

PMID: 725919. **Title:** Efficacy of Neratinib in Improving Outcomes for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Despite advancements in HER2-targeted therapies, a significant proportion of HER2-positive breast cancer patients experience disease recurrence or progression. Neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its impact on long-term clinical outcomes remains under investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neratinib in the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial, 2,840 patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral neratinib (240 mg/day) or placebo for 12 months. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) at 5 years. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), and safety. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models, and log-rank tests, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:** At a median follow-up of 60 months, neratinib significantly improved iDFS compared to placebo (85.3% vs. 79.1%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.89; *p* = 0.003). The 5-year OS rate was also higher in the neratinib group (92.4% vs. 88.7%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61–0.95; *p* = 0.02). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefit across hormone receptor status and nodal involvement. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (grade 3: 38.2% vs. 1.5% in placebo) and fatigue, which were manageable with dose modifications and supportive care.  

**Conclusion:** Neratinib significantly improves invasive disease-free survival and overall survival in HER2-positive breast cancer patients following trastuzumab-based therapy, establishing it as a valuable adjuvant treatment option. Proactive management of gastrointestinal toxicity is recommended to optimize adherence and outcomes. These findings support the integration of neratinib into standard HER2-positive breast cancer regimens.

PMID: 230191. Neratinib, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER1, HER2, and HER4, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for HER2-positive breast cancer, particularly in the extended adjuvant setting. This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of neratinib versus placebo in 2,840 patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), with secondary endpoints including distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS). After a median follow-up of 60 months, neratinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in iDFS, with a 5-year iDFS rate of 90.2% (95% CI: 88.5–91.7) compared to 87.7% (95% CI: 85.9–89.3) in the placebo group (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59–0.90; p=0.004). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent benefits across hormone receptor-positive and -negative cohorts. The DDFS was also significantly prolonged with neratinib (HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60–0.94; p=0.012), though OS data remained immature at the time of analysis. The most common adverse events were grade 1–2 diarrhea (93.4% vs. 35.2% in placebo), with 39.9% of neratinib-treated patients experiencing grade 3 diarrhea, managed effectively with prophylactic loperamide. Quality-of-life metrics, assessed via EORTC QLQ-C30, showed no clinically meaningful differences between arms. These findings underscore neratinib as a potent adjuvant therapy, significantly reducing recurrence risk with a manageable toxicity profile. The 2.5% absolute improvement in iDFS at 5 years translates to a meaningful clinical benefit, supporting its integration into standard treatment paradigms for high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term survival outcomes.

PMID: 435150. **Title:** Efficacy of Neratinib in Improving Outcomes for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Despite advancements in HER2-targeted therapies, a significant proportion of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer experience disease recurrence or progression. Neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its clinical efficacy in improving long-term outcomes remains to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of neratinib on invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS) in HER2-positive early-stage and metastatic breast cancer patients.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial, 1,524 patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either neratinib (240 mg/day orally) or placebo for 12 months. The primary endpoint was iDFS at 5 years; secondary endpoints included OS, distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), and safety. Statistical analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models, and log-rank tests, with significance set at p < 0.05.  

**Results:** At a median follow-up of 60 months, neratinib significantly improved iDFS compared to placebo (85.3% vs. 77.1%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.83; p = 0.001). The 5-year OS rate was also higher in the neratinib group (91.2% vs. 86.5%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55–0.94; p = 0.015). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefits across hormone receptor status and nodal involvement. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (grade 3: 28.5% neratinib vs. 2.1% placebo) and fatigue, which were manageable with dose modifications and supportive care.  

**Conclusion:** Neratinib significantly enhances iDFS and OS in HER2-positive breast cancer patients following trastuzumab-based therapy, establishing it as a valuable addition to the adjuvant treatment paradigm. These findings support the incorporation of neratinib into standard care protocols, particularly for high-risk populations. Further studies are warranted to optimize dosing strategies and mitigate gastrointestinal toxicity.

Breast Cancer	Olaparib	"PMID: 466915. **Title:** Olaparib as a Targeted Therapy in *BRCA*-Mutated Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Demonstrating Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival  

**Background:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as olaparib, have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for *BRCA*-mutated cancers due to their synthetic lethality in homologous recombination-deficient tumors. Despite preclinical efficacy, robust clinical data on olaparib in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remain limited. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus standard chemotherapy in patients with *BRCA1/2*-mutated, HER2-negative MBC.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 302 patients with *BRCA1/2*-mutated MBC were assigned 1:1 to receive either olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided α of 0.05.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, olaparib significantly prolonged median PFS compared to chemotherapy (9.8 vs. 5.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.68; *p* < 0.001). The ORR was higher with olaparib (52.3% vs. 28.7%, *p* = 0.002). Interim OS data showed a trend favoring olaparib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55–1.05, *p* = 0.09). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with olaparib (36.1% vs. 50.4%), with anemia (16.2%) and fatigue (8.5%) being the most common.  

**Conclusion:** Olaparib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS over standard chemotherapy in *BRCA*-mutated MBC, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support olaparib as a first-line targeted therapy for this molecularly defined population.

PMID: 550774. **Title:** Olaparib as a Targeted Therapy in BRCA-Mutated Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Demonstrating Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival  

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Olaparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in inducing synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. This Phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the efficacy and safety of Olaparib compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative, BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label trial, 302 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either Olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the Olaparib group (7.8 months [95% CI: 7.2–9.1]) compared to the chemotherapy group (4.2 months [95% CI: 3.8–5.1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% CI: 0.41–0.66; p < 0.001). The ORR was 59.9% (95% CI: 52.4–67.1) for Olaparib versus 28.8% (95% CI: 22.3–36.0) for chemotherapy (p < 0.001). Interim OS data showed a trend favoring Olaparib (HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56–1.01; p = 0.06). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with Olaparib (36.5%) versus chemotherapy (50.2%), with anemia (16.1%) and fatigue (9.8%) being the most common Olaparib-related toxicities.  

**Discussion:** Olaparib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the use of Olaparib as a first-line targeted therapy in this molecularly defined population. Further follow-up is warranted to confirm OS benefits.

PMID: 242412. **Title:** Efficacy of Olaparib in Improving Outcomes for Patients with BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Olaparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in inducing synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. This Phase III trial evaluated the clinical benefit of Olaparib versus standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) harboring germline BRCA1/2 mutations.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 302 patients with confirmed germline BRCA1/2 mutations and HER2-negative mBC were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral Olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the Olaparib group compared to the chemotherapy group (7.8 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.76; p < 0.001). The 12-month PFS rate was 35.2% for Olaparib versus 12.6% for chemotherapy. ORR was higher with Olaparib (52.4% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.002). Interim OS analysis showed a trend favoring Olaparib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62–1.09, p = 0.16), though not statistically significant. Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with Olaparib (36.7% vs. 50.4%), with anemia (16.2%) being the most common Olaparib-related toxicity.  

**Conclusion:** Olaparib significantly improves PFS and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative mBC, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support Olaparib as a first-line therapeutic option for this molecularly defined population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCTXXXXXXX.

PMID: 873872. **Title:** *Efficacy of Olaparib in Advanced Breast Cancer with Germline BRCA Mutations: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer harboring germline BRCA1/2 mutations.  

**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by prior chemotherapy lines (0–1 vs. ≥2) and hormone receptor status (positive vs. negative).  

**Participants:** Eligible participants were adults with confirmed HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations. A total of 302 patients were enrolled from 97 sites across 19 countries.  

**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All participants received best supportive care.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group (7.8 months [95% CI, 6.4–9.1]) compared to placebo (4.2 months [95% CI, 3.0–5.7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.43–0.80; *p* = 0.0009). ORR was 52% (95% CI, 45–59) with olaparib versus 23% (95% CI, 15–32) with placebo (*p* < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend favoring olaparib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55–1.21; *p* = 0.32). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 40% of olaparib-treated patients (most commonly anemia [16%]) versus 23% with placebo.  

**Conclusions:** Olaparib significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support olaparib as a targeted therapeutic option for this molecularly defined population.

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Olaparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in homologous recombination repair-deficient tumors. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) harboring germline BRCA1/2 mutations.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 302 patients with confirmed germline BRCA1/2 mutations and HER2-negative mBC were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with a two-sided p-value <0.05 considered significant.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, olaparib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to chemotherapy (9.8 months vs. 5.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.68; p<0.001). The ORR was significantly higher in the olaparib group (52.3% vs. 28.6%; p=0.002). Interim OS analysis showed a trend favoring olaparib (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.56–1.09; p=0.14), though data were immature. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were consistent with prior reports, with fewer grade ≥3 AEs in the olaparib arm (36.7% vs. 50.2%).  

**Discussion:** Olaparib significantly prolonged PFS and improved response rates in patients with BRCA-mutated mBC, establishing its role as a first-line therapeutic option. The favorable safety profile further supports its clinical utility. These findings underscore the importance of PARP inhibition in BRCA-associated breast cancer and warrant further investigation into combination strategies and long-term survival outcomes.

Breast Cancer	Palbociclib	"PMID: 860557. **Title:** *Efficacy of Palbociclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial*  

**Abstract**  

**Background:** Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. This study evaluates its efficacy and safety compared to standard endocrine therapy alone.  

**Population:** A total of 650 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer were enrolled in this multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients had measurable disease and no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either palbociclib (125 mg/day orally, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or letrozole alone.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received letrozole monotherapy (2.5 mg/day). Stratification factors included visceral metastases and prior endocrine therapy.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 28 months, the palbociclib-letrozole group demonstrated significantly longer median PFS (24.5 months vs. 14.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47–0.72, *p* < 0.001). ORR was higher in the combination arm (42.3% vs. 28.9%, *p* = 0.003). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64–1.05, *p* = 0.11). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the palbociclib arm were neutropenia (56.2%) and fatigue (12.4%), but febrile neutropenia was rare (1.8%).  

**Conclusion:** Palbociclib combined with letrozole significantly improves PFS and ORR in HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, supporting its use as first-line therapy. The safety profile was manageable, with hematologic toxicity being the primary concern.

PMID: 853472. **Title:** *Efficacy of Palbociclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial*  

**Background:**  
Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Despite its incorporation into treatment regimens, comprehensive data on its long-term efficacy and impact on progression-free survival (PFS) remain limited. This phase III trial aimed to evaluate the clinical benefit of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy compared to endocrine therapy alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 650 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either palbociclib (125 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the palbociclib-letrozole group demonstrated a significantly longer median PFS compared to the placebo-letrozole group (24.8 vs. 14.5 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47–0.72; p < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the palbociclib arm (55.2% vs. 39.7%, p = 0.002). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent PFS benefits across all predefined subgroups. While OS data remain immature, a trend toward improved survival was observed (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.64–1.05; p = 0.12). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events in the palbociclib group were neutropenia (62.1%) and fatigue (12.4%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:**  
Palbociclib in combination with letrozole significantly improves PFS and ORR in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, with a tolerable safety profile. These findings reinforce palbociclib as a first-line standard of care in this patient population. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term survival benefits.

PMID: 425428. **Title:** Efficacy of Palbociclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Abstract**  

**Background:** Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. This study evaluates its efficacy and safety compared to standard endocrine therapy alone.  

**Population:** A total of 521 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled across 87 centers. Participants had measurable disease and no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Median age was 62 years (range 38–79).  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either palbociclib (125 mg/day orally, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day continuously) or letrozole alone. Stratification was based on disease site and prior chemotherapy.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received letrozole monotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint; secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Outcomes:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the palbociclib-letrozole group (24.8 months [95% CI 22.1–28.5]) versus letrozole alone (14.5 months [95% CI 12.3–16.7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.72, p < 0.001). ORR was 55.3% (95% CI 49.2–61.4) in the combination group versus 39.1% (95% CI 33.0–45.2) in the monotherapy group (p = 0.002). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 62.4% of palbociclib-treated patients but was manageable with dose adjustments. No significant difference in OS was observed at interim analysis (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67–1.11, p = 0.24).  

**Conclusion:** Palbociclib combined with letrozole significantly improves PFS and ORR in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer, supporting its use as first-line therapy. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies, with neutropenia being the most common adverse event.

PMID: 341336. **Abstract:** Palbociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a transformative therapy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) versus ET alone in a randomized, phase III clinical trial involving 650 patients with metastatic or locally advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Patients were stratified by menopausal status and prior ET exposure and randomized 1:1 to receive either palbociclib (125 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or letrozole alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 42 months, the palbociclib-letrozole group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS (27.5 months vs. 14.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47–0.72; p < 0.001) and ORR (55.2% vs. 39.6%; p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent PFS benefits across all predefined subgroups, including prior ET exposure and visceral metastasis. OS data, though immature, showed a trend favoring palbociclib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65–1.03; p = 0.09). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events in the palbociclib arm were neutropenia (62.3%) and leukopenia (28.7%), which were manageable with dose modifications. These findings underscore palbociclib’s role as a first-line therapy for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, significantly prolonging PFS with a tolerable safety profile. The study supports the integration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into standard ET regimens, offering a clinically meaningful improvement in patient outcomes. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term OS benefits and resistance mechanisms.

PMID: 240453. **Title:** *Palbociclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Demonstrating Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival*  

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:**  
Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Despite its incorporation into clinical practice, robust phase III data confirming its efficacy in improving long-term outcomes remain pivotal. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 650 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either palbociclib (125 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 36 months, the palbociclib group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo group (27.4 vs. 14.2 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47–0.72; *p* < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the palbociclib arm (55.3% vs. 39.8%, *p* = 0.002). While OS data were immature at the time of analysis, a trend toward benefit was observed (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65–1.03; *p* = 0.09). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were neutropenia (62.1% vs. 1.2%) and fatigue (9.4% vs. 5.1%), consistent with prior reports.  

**Discussion:**  
This phase III trial confirms that palbociclib significantly prolongs PFS in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, reinforcing its role as a first-line therapy in combination with ET. The safety profile was manageable, with neutropenia being the predominant toxicity. These findings support the continued use of palbociclib in this patient population, with ongoing follow-up required to assess OS benefit.

Breast Cancer	Pembrolizumab	"PMID: 975075. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Abstract**  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) breast cancer.  

**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 expression (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10 vs. <10) and prior therapy lines.  

**Participants:** Eligible patients (n=702) had metastatic or unresectable locally advanced TNBC or HR+/HER2− breast cancer, with progression on ≥1 prior systemic therapy. Participants were randomized 2:1 to pembrolizumab (n=468) or placebo (n=234), both combined with standard chemotherapy.  

**Interventions:** Pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) versus placebo plus chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median follow-up was 18.5 months. Pembrolizumab significantly improved PFS (median 9.2 vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.81, p<0.001) and OS (median 22.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.89, p=0.002). ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (38.5% vs. 21.8%, p<0.001), with longer median DOR (12.7 vs. 7.4 months). Benefit was pronounced in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 subgroups (PFS HR 0.55, p<0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 58.3% (pembrolizumab) vs. 52.1% (placebo), with immune-related events (14.2%) managed per protocol.  

**Conclusions:** Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly prolongs PFS and OS in advanced breast cancer, particularly in PD-L1–enriched populations, with a manageable safety profile. These data support pembrolizumab as a first-line therapeutic option for select patients.

PMID: 247215. **Title:** Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial  

**Background:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic options for aggressive breast cancer subtypes. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  

**Population:** A total of 620 patients with metastatic or unresectable TNBC (PD-L1 combined positive score [CPS] ≥10) were enrolled across 85 centers. Eligible participants had received ≤2 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus investigator’s choice chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or chemotherapy alone.  

**Comparison:** The control arm received the same chemotherapy regimens without pembrolizumab. Stratification factors included PD-L1 status, prior therapy, and chemotherapy backbone.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At median follow-up of 18.5 months, pembrolizumab significantly improved median PFS (9.7 months vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.81, p<0.001) and OS (23.1 months vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.89, p=0.002). ORR was higher in the pembrolizumab arm (48.3% vs. 33.7%, p=0.003). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 68% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 62% in the control arm, with immune-related adverse events (e.g., hypothyroidism, colitis) more frequent in the pembrolizumab group (24% vs. 5%).  

**Conclusion:** Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly prolongs PFS and OS in PD-L1-positive advanced TNBC, establishing a new standard of care. The safety profile was manageable and consistent with prior reports.

PMID: 112619. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, particularly in tumors expressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and PD-L1-positive hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. A total of 620 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 24.5 months, the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to the chemotherapy-alone group (median PFS 9.8 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.75; p < 0.001). OS was also significantly longer in the pembrolizumab arm (median OS 23.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.88; p = 0.002). The ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (48.3% vs. 32.7%, p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 12.1% of patients versus 5.4% in the control arm. Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58.9% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 52.3% in the chemotherapy-alone group, with no new safety signals identified. These results demonstrate that pembrolizumab significantly enhances clinical outcomes in PD-L1-positive advanced breast cancer, supporting its integration into standard treatment paradigms for this patient population. Further studies are warranted to explore biomarkers predictive of response and long-term survival benefits.

PMID: 298226. **Title: Pembrolizumab Significantly Improves Outcomes in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:** Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive biology and limited treatment options. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has shown promise in early-phase trials, but its efficacy in advanced TNBC warrants further investigation. This phase III study evaluated the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or unresectable TNBC.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 602 patients with previously untreated PD-L1-positive (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) metastatic TNBC were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, pembrolizumab significantly improved PFS compared to placebo (median PFS: 9.7 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.81; p < 0.001). OS was also prolonged in the pembrolizumab group (median OS: 23.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.89; p = 0.003). The ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (48.3% vs. 33.7%, p = 0.002), with complete responses observed in 12.1% vs. 5.4% of patients. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 52% of pembrolizumab recipients versus 48% in the placebo group, with immune-related adverse events (e.g., hypothyroidism, colitis) more frequent in the pembrolizumab arm.  

**Conclusion:** Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly improves PFS, OS, and ORR in patients with advanced PD-L1-positive TNBC, establishing a new standard of care. The safety profile was manageable, supporting its use in this high-risk population. These findings underscore the role of immune checkpoint inhibition in TNBC and warrant further exploration in biomarker-selected cohorts.

PMID: 607589. Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 dimerization, has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic agent in HER2-positive breast cancer, demonstrating significant improvements in patient outcomes when combined with standard regimens. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial involving 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety profile. Results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS for the pertuzumab group (18.5 months; 95% CI: 16.4–21.6) compared to the placebo group (12.4 months; 95% CI: 10.4–13.5), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51–0.75; p < 0.0001). OS data revealed a median survival of 56.5 months (95% CI: 49.3–not reached) in the pertuzumab arm versus 40.8 months (95% CI: 35.8–48.3) in the control arm (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.56–0.84; p = 0.0002). The ORR was 80.2% (95% CI: 76.0–84.0) in the pertuzumab group compared to 69.3% (95% CI: 64.5–73.8) in the placebo group (p = 0.001). Adverse events were manageable, with higher incidences of grade ≥3 diarrhea (9.8% vs. 3.7%) and neutropenia (48.9% vs. 45.8%) in the pertuzumab arm. These findings underscore the clinical benefit of pertuzumab-based therapy, establishing it as a cornerstone in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with robust statistical significance and meaningful improvements in both PFS and OS. The safety profile remains consistent with known HER2-targeted therapies, reinforcing its role in first-line treatment protocols.

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Despite advances in HER2-targeted therapies, metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer remains a clinical challenge. Pertuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits HER2 dimerization, has shown promise in preclinical studies. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel compared to trastuzumab and docetaxel alone in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were randomized (1:1) to receive either pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and docetaxel (75 mg/m², escalating to 100 mg/m² if tolerated) or placebo plus trastuzumab and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review.

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 50 months, the pertuzumab group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to the control group (median PFS: 18.5 vs. 12.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.75; p < 0.001). OS was also significantly longer in the pertuzumab arm (median OS: 56.5 vs. 40.8 months; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56–0.84; p = 0.0002). The ORR was higher with pertuzumab (80.2% vs. 69.3%; p = 0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events were comparable between arms (57.3% vs. 53.2%), with no new safety signals observed.  

**Discussion:** The addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel significantly improved PFS and OS in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support pertuzumab as a first-line standard of care in this population. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in early-stage disease and resistance mechanisms.

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the ribociclib combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to placebo (27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.70; p < 0.0001). The 24-month PFS rate was 63.2% (95% CI 57.1–68.7) in the ribociclib group versus 42.1% (95% CI 36.0–48.1) in the placebo group. ORR was significantly higher with ribociclib (52.4% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.002). A trend toward improved OS was observed (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57–1.02; p = 0.06). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (59.3% vs. 0.9%) and leukopenia (21.1% vs. 0.5%), with no new safety signals identified.  

**Conclusion:** Ribociclib in combination with letrozole significantly prolongs PFS and enhances tumor response in HR+/HER2− advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support ribociclib as a first-line treatment option in this patient population.

PMID: 372336. **Title:** Ribociclib in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer is the most common subtype of advanced breast cancer. Despite endocrine therapy (ET), disease progression remains a significant challenge. Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its impact on long-term clinical outcomes requires further validation. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus ET versus ET alone in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test (two-sided α = 0.05).  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the ribociclib combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to ET alone (median PFS: 27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.70; p < 0.001). The 24-month PFS rate was 63.2% (95% CI 57.1–68.8) in the ribociclib group versus 42.1% (95% CI 36.0–48.2) in the placebo group. ORR was significantly higher with ribociclib (52.4% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.003). OS data were immature but trended favorably (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54–1.06; p = 0.09). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (58.3%) and leukopenia (24.1%), manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:** Ribociclib in combination with letrozole significantly prolongs PFS in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, with a tolerable safety profile. These findings support ribociclib as a first-line treatment option in this population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT12345678.

PMID: 303702. Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a transformative therapy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. This multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone as first-line treatment in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. A total of 668 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 42.5 months, the ribociclib combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to letrozole alone (27.6 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.70; p < 0.0001). OS data, though immature, showed a trend favoring ribociclib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60–0.96; p = 0.021). The ORR was significantly higher in the ribociclib arm (52.7% vs. 37.1%; p = 0.001). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the ribociclib group were neutropenia (58.3%) and leukopenia (24.1%), which were manageable with dose adjustments. Quality-of-life assessments revealed no significant deterioration with ribociclib. These findings underscore ribociclib as a cornerstone therapy in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, offering a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS with a manageable safety profile. The data support the incorporation of ribociclib into standard first-line treatment regimens for this patient population. Further follow-up is warranted to confirm OS benefits.

PMID: 399863. **Title:** Ribociclib in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer remains a therapeutic challenge, with endocrine therapy (ET) resistance often limiting long-term efficacy. Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but robust clinical data are needed to confirm its impact on patient outcomes.  

**Population:** This multicenter, phase III trial enrolled 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  

**Intervention:** Patients in the experimental arm received oral ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day).  

**Comparison:** The control arm received letrozole alone (2.5 mg/day).  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, ribociclib plus letrozole demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to letrozole alone (27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.70; *p* < 0.001). The 24-month PFS rate was 64.2% (95% CI 58.1–69.7) in the ribociclib group versus 42.7% (95% CI 36.5–48.8) in the control group. ORR was also higher with ribociclib (52.4% vs. 37.1%; *p* = 0.003). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward benefit (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55–1.05; *p* = 0.09). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the ribociclib arm were neutropenia (58.3%) and leukopenia (24.1%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusion:** Ribociclib in combination with letrozole significantly prolongs PFS and improves response rates in HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, establishing it as a first-line standard of care. These findings support the integration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into frontline therapy for this patient population.

PMID: 635370. **Title: Ribociclib in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Introduction:**  
Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies by targeting cell cycle progression. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) compared to ET alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 668 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test with a two-sided α of 0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the ribociclib-ET combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to ET alone (median PFS: 27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.70; p < 0.001). The 24-month PFS rate was 64.2% (95% CI 58.5–69.9) in the ribociclib group versus 42.8% (95% CI 36.9–48.7) in the placebo group. ORR was significantly higher with ribociclib (52.3% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.002). OS data were immature but showed a favorable trend (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54–1.06; p = 0.09). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (58.3% vs. 1.2%) and leukopenia (21.5% vs. 0.6%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Discussion:**  
Ribociclib in combination with ET significantly prolongs PFS in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, with a clinically meaningful 12.9-month improvement over ET alone. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies, supporting ribociclib as a first-line standard of care. These findings reinforce the pivotal role of CDK4/6 inhibition in improving outcomes for this patient population. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term OS benefits.

Breast Cancer	Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy	"PMID: 699518. **Title:** *Efficacy and Safety of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  

**Background:** Despite advances in systemic therapy, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) remains an aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study evaluates its efficacy versus standard chemotherapy in patients with pretreated mTNBC.  

**Population:** This multicenter, open-label, Phase III trial enrolled 468 patients with mTNBC who had received ≥2 prior systemic therapies (≥1 for metastatic disease). Eligible participants had measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG performance status 0–1.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine).  

**Comparison:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Outcomes:** Median PFS was significantly longer with SG (5.6 months [95% CI: 4.3–6.9]) versus chemotherapy (2.3 months [95% CI: 1.8–3.2]; HR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.32–0.52; *p* < 0.001). SG also improved median OS (12.1 vs. 8.7 months; HR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.53–0.85; *p* = 0.002) and ORR (35% vs. 11%, *p* < 0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events were more common with SG (64% vs. 52%), primarily neutropenia (42% vs. 28%) and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%), but were manageable with dose modifications.  

**Conclusion:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in heavily pretreated mTNBC, establishing a new standard of care in this high-risk population.

**Abstract**  

**Introduction:** Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive biology and limited treatment options. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SG compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with pretreated mTNBC.  

**Methods:** In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, 468 patients with mTNBC who had received ≥2 prior lines of therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** At a median follow-up of 18.7 months, SG significantly improved PFS compared to chemotherapy (median PFS: 5.6 vs. 1.7 months; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.32–0.52; p < 0.001). OS was also prolonged with SG (median OS: 12.1 vs. 6.7 months; HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38–0.62; p < 0.001). The ORR was higher in the SG arm (35% vs. 5%, p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 4% of SG-treated patients. Grade ≥3 adverse events were more frequent with SG (neutropenia: 51% vs. 33%; diarrhea: 10% vs. 1%), but discontinuation rates were similar (5% vs. 4%).  

**Discussion:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in heavily pretreated mTNBC patients. The safety profile was manageable, with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity being the most common adverse events. These findings support SG as a new standard of care in this high-risk population. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and biomarker-driven subsets.

Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SG compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with refractory mTNBC.  

**Methods:** In this open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 468 patients with mTNBC who had received ≥2 prior systemic therapies were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided α of 0.05.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer with SG (5.6 months [95% CI: 4.3–6.9]) versus chemotherapy (2.3 months [95% CI: 1.8–3.0]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% CI: 0.32–0.52; *p* < 0.001). OS was also improved (median 12.1 vs. 7.8 months; HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.49–0.78; *p* < 0.001). ORR was higher with SG (35% [95% CI: 29–41]) versus chemotherapy (11% [95% CI: 7–15]; *p* < 0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 58% of SG-treated patients (vs. 47% with chemotherapy), with neutropenia (28%) and diarrhea (10%) being most common.  

**Discussion:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in pretreated mTNBC.

Breast Cancer	Talazoparib	"PMID: 975088. **Title:** *Efficacy of Talazoparib in Advanced Breast Cancer Patients with Germline BRCA1/2 Mutations: A Randomized Controlled Trial*  

**Background:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Talazoparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, has shown preclinical activity, but its clinical impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced disease remains under investigation.  

**Population:** This phase III, multicenter, randomized trial enrolled 412 patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and confirmed germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Eligible participants had received ≤3 prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either oral talazoparib (1 mg/day) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin).  

**Comparison:** The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Outcomes:** After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, talazoparib significantly improved PFS compared to chemotherapy (median PFS 8.6 vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42–0.71; p < 0.001). OS data were immature but showed a trend favoring talazoparib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57–1.02; p = 0.06). The ORR was higher with talazoparib (45.2% vs. 21.8%, p < 0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with talazoparib (32% vs. 48%), though anemia (24%) was more common in the talazoparib arm.  

**Conclusion:** Talazoparib demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and ORR over standard chemotherapy in BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support talazoparib as a first-line option for this molecularly defined population.

PMID: 828987. **Title: Talazoparib Monotherapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer with Germline BRCA Mutations: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  

**Background:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients with germline *BRCA1/2* mutations. Talazoparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, has demonstrated preclinical efficacy, but its impact on clinical outcomes in advanced breast cancer remains under investigation. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of talazoparib versus standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and germline *BRCA1/2* mutations.  

**Methods:** In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, 431 patients with HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and confirmed germline *BRCA1/2* mutations were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either talazoparib (1 mg orally once daily) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  

**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, talazoparib significantly improved median PFS compared to chemotherapy (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43–0.68; *p* < 0.001). The 12-month PFS rate was 37.1% (95% CI 30.5–43.7) in the talazoparib group versus 16.3% (95% CI 11.2–21.4) in the chemotherapy group. ORR was higher with talazoparib (62.7% vs. 27.2%; *p* < 0.001). Interim OS data showed a trend favoring talazoparib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57–1.02; *p* = 0.06). Grade ≥3 adverse events were less frequent with talazoparib (55.8% vs. 68.4%), though anemia (39.2%) was more common in the talazoparib arm.  

**Conclusion:** Talazoparib monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and germline *BRCA1/2* mutations. These findings support talazoparib as a first-line therapeutic option for this patient population.

PMID: 663593. **Abstract**  

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of talazoparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in patients with advanced breast cancer harboring germline *BRCA1/2* mutations (*gBRCAm*).  

**Design:** Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were stratified by prior platinum exposure, hormone receptor status, and central nervous system metastases.  

**Participants:** A total of 412 patients with *gBRCAm* HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were enrolled across 87 sites. Eligible participants had measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG performance status 0–1.  

**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive talazoparib (1 mg orally once daily) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Crossover was permitted upon progression.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer with talazoparib versus placebo (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.41–0.71; *p* < 0.001). ORR was 62.6% (95% CI 56.2–68.7) in the talazoparib arm versus 27.2% (95% CI 19.3–36.3) in the placebo arm (*p* < 0.001). CBR was 68.4% versus 36.1%, respectively (*p* < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend favoring talazoparib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55–1.05; *p* = 0.09). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events with talazoparib were anemia (34.7%) and thrombocytopenia (16.2%), manageable with dose adjustments.  

**Conclusions:** Talazoparib demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and ORR compared to placebo in *gBRCAm* HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support talazoparib as a first-line therapeutic option for this patient population.

PMID: 121191. **Abstract**  
Talazoparib, a potent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for breast cancer patients with germline *BRCA1/2* mutations. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of talazoparib in 431 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer harboring *BRCA1/2* mutations. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive talazoparib (1 mg/day) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 24.3 months, talazoparib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy (median PFS 8.6 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–0.71; *p* < 0.001). The ORR was significantly higher in the talazoparib arm (62.6% vs. 27.2%; *p* < 0.001), with a complete response rate of 12.4% versus 3.1% in the chemotherapy arm. While OS data remained immature at the time of analysis, a trend toward improved survival was observed (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55–1.06; *p* = 0.11). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events with talazoparib were anemia (34.7%) and thrombocytopenia (16.8%), which were manageable with dose modifications. These findings establish talazoparib as a superior treatment option for *BRCA*-mutated breast cancer, offering significant clinical benefit with a favorable risk-benefit profile. The robust PFS advantage and higher response rates underscore its potential as a first-line therapy in this molecularly defined population, warranting further investigation in broader clinical settings.

**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of talazoparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, compared to physician’s choice of chemotherapy in patients with advanced *BRCA1/2*-mutated breast cancer.  

**Design:** Multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial (NCT12345678). Patients were stratified by hormone receptor status, prior platinum exposure, and central nervous system metastases.  

**Participants:** Eligible patients (n = 412) had locally advanced or metastatic *BRCA1/2*-mutated HER2-negative breast cancer and ≤3 prior cytotoxic regimens. Median age was 48 years (range 25–72); 68% had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  

**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive talazoparib (1 mg/day orally) or standard chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.  

**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer with talazoparib (8.6 months, 95% CI 7.2–9.8) vs. chemotherapy (5.2 months, 95% CI 4.1–6.1; hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.41–0.71; *p* < 0.001). ORR was 45.3% (95% CI 38.9–51.8) vs. 21.7% (95% CI 15.2–29.4; *p* < 0.001). OS data were immature but trended favorably (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61–1.10; *p* = 0.18). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 55% (talazoparib) vs. 68% (chemotherapy), with anemia (32%) and neutropenia (15%) most common for talazoparib.  

**Conclusions:** Talazoparib demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and ORR compared to chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile, establishing it as a preferred treatment for *BRCA*-mutated advanced breast cancer.

Breast Cancer	Toremifene	"PMID: 269842. **Title:** Efficacy of Toremifene in Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Abstract**  

**Background:** Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toremifene compared to standard tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, 450 postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer were enrolled between January 2018 and December 2022. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either toremifene 60 mg daily (n=225) or tamoxifen 20 mg daily (n=225). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Median follow-up was 36 months (IQR 24–48).  

**Results:** Toremifene significantly improved PFS compared to tamoxifen (median PFS: 18.4 months vs. 14.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.89; p=0.003). OS was also longer in the toremifene group (median OS: 42.6 months vs. 38.1 months; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67–0.98; p=0.032). The ORR was higher with toremifene (35.6% vs. 28.9%, p=0.047). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across age, metastatic site, and prior endocrine therapy. Grade 3–4 adverse events were similar between groups (22.2% with toremifene vs. 20.9% with tamoxifen, p=0.71), with hot flashes (18.7%) and arthralgia (12.4%) being most common in the toremifene arm.  

**Conclusion:** Toremifene demonstrated superior efficacy over tamoxifen in improving PFS and OS in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support toremifene as a first-line endocrine therapy option in this population.

PMID: 709450. **Title:** Efficacy of Toremifene in Adjuvant Treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:** Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This study evaluates its efficacy compared to standard tamoxifen therapy in improving disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer.  

**Population:** A total of 1,248 postmenopausal women with stage I-III HR+ breast cancer were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, phase III trial. Participants were stratified by nodal status and tumor size.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral toremifene (60 mg/day) or tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for 5 years as adjuvant therapy.  

**Comparison:** The primary comparison was between toremifene and tamoxifen in terms of DFS and OS. Secondary endpoints included toxicity profiles and quality-of-life measures.  

**Outcomes:** At a median follow-up of 72 months, toremifene demonstrated superior DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.2% vs. 79.6%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61–0.89; p = 0.002). OS was also significantly improved in the toremifene group (91.5% vs. 87.3%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54–0.88; p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across all stratification factors. Toremifene was associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events (3.1% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.02) and endometrial hyperplasia (1.4% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.01).  

**Conclusion:** Toremifene significantly improves DFS and OS compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer, with a more favorable safety profile. These findings support its use as a first-line adjuvant therapy in this population.

PMID: 397504. Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of toremifene (60 mg/day) compared to tamoxifen (20 mg/day) in 1,248 postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic HR+ breast cancer over a median follow-up of 5.2 years. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety profile. Toremifene demonstrated non-inferiority to tamoxifen in PFS (median PFS 14.7 vs. 14.4 months; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82–1.06, p=0.27) while exhibiting superior OS in a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients with bone metastases (median OS 42.1 vs. 36.8 months; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64–0.95, p=0.012). ORR was comparable between groups (38.5% vs. 36.2%, p=0.41), but toremifene showed a significantly lower incidence of thromboembolic events (4.1% vs. 7.3%, p=0.008) and endometrial abnormalities (2.8% vs. 5.6%, p=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed toremifene’s independent prognostic value for OS (adjusted HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–0.98, p=0.024). Quality-of-life metrics favored toremifene, with fewer hot flashes (p=0.032) and better emotional functioning (p=0.047) per EORTC QLQ-C30. These findings position toremifene as a viable alternative to tamoxifen, particularly for high-risk patients, offering comparable efficacy with an improved safety profile. The significant OS benefit in bone metastasis subgroups (p=0.012) warrants further investigation into bone-specific mechanisms. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01954303.

PMID: 528772. **Title:** Efficacy of Toremifene in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  

**Background:**  
Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. While tamoxifen remains the gold standard, toremifene’s favorable safety profile and potential efficacy warrant further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of toremifene compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with HR+ early-stage breast cancer.  

**Methods:**  
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial, 1,248 postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer were enrolled between January 2015 and December 2018. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either toremifene 60 mg/day (n=624) or tamoxifen 20 mg/day (n=624) for five years. Primary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints assessed adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL). Statistical analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p<0.05.  

**Results:**  
After a median follow-up of 60 months, toremifene demonstrated superior DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.2% vs. 79.6%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.89, p=0.003). OS was also significantly improved in the toremifene group (91.4% vs. 87.1%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.92, p=0.011). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across age, tumor size, and nodal status. Toremifene was associated with fewer thromboembolic events (3.2% vs. 6.8%, p=0.002) and endometrial abnormalities (2.5% vs. 5.1%, p=0.012). QoL scores were higher in the toremifene arm (p=0.023).  

**Conclusion:**  
Toremifene significantly improves DFS and OS in postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer, with a more favorable safety profile than tamoxifen. These findings support toremifene as a viable first-line endocrine therapy, particularly for patients at risk of thromboembolic or endometrial complications. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in metastatic settings.

Breast Cancer	Trastuzumab	"PMID: 179969. **Title:** Efficacy of Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial Assessing Survival and Treatment Outcomes  

**Abstract**  

**Background:** Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, comprehensive real-world data on its impact on long-term survival and comparative efficacy remain critical for clinical decision-making.  

**Population:** This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial enrolled 1,248 patients with HER2-positive early-stage or locally advanced breast cancer (median age 52 years, range 28–75) between January 2015 and December 2020. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+ or FISH ratio ≥2.0) and no prior systemic therapy.  

**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive standard chemotherapy (anthracycline/taxane-based regimen) with or without trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 12 months).  

**Comparison:** The control arm received chemotherapy alone. Stratification factors included hormone receptor status, nodal involvement, and tumor size.  

**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At median follow-up of 62 months, trastuzumab significantly improved DFS (82.4% vs. 68.1%; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.69, p < 0.001) and OS (89.3% vs. 76.8%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47–0.79, p = 0.002). ORR was higher in the trastuzumab arm (78.6% vs. 58.2%, p < 0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events (e.g., cardiotoxicity) were more frequent with trastuzumab (12.1% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.01) but manageable.  

**Conclusion:** Trastuzumab significantly enhances survival outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer, supporting its integration as standard adjuvant therapy. The benefit-risk profile remains favorable, though cardiac monitoring is essential.

PMID: 817567. **Title: Efficacy of Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial Assessing Survival and Disease Progression**  

**Background:** Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is associated with aggressive tumor biology and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has revolutionized treatment, but comprehensive real-world efficacy data remain critical for clinical decision-making.  

**Objective:** To evaluate the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 1,024 patients with HER2-positive early or metastatic breast cancer were enrolled between 2015–2020. Participants were stratified 1:1 to receive standard chemotherapy (anthracycline/taxane-based) with or without trastuzumab (loading dose: 8 mg/kg; maintenance: 6 mg/kg q3w). Primary endpoints were OS and PFS; secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs).  

**Results:** At median follow-up of 60 months, the trastuzumab group demonstrated superior OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.51–0.75; p < 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45–0.65; p < 0.001) compared to chemotherapy alone. Five-year OS was 89.3% (95% CI 86.1–92.5) vs. 76.8% (95% CI 72.4–81.2), and median PFS was 42.1 months (95% CI 38.5–46.7) vs. 24.9 months (95% CI 21.3–28.5). ORR was 78.4% (95% CI 74.9–81.9) with trastuzumab versus 58.2% (95% CI 54.0–62.4; p < 0.001). Grade ≥3 AEs (cardiotoxicity, neutropenia) were higher in the trastuzumab arm (18.6% vs. 12.3%; p = 0.02) but manageable.  

**Conclusion:** Trastuzumab significantly improves OS and PFS in HER2-positive breast cancer, reinforcing its role as first-line therapy. Despite increased cardiotoxicity, benefits outweigh risks, supporting its integration into standard regimens.

PMID: 518373. **Title:** Efficacy of Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial Assessing Survival and Treatment Outcomes  

**Background:** Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer accounts for approximately 20% of breast malignancies and is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has revolutionized treatment, but comprehensive real-world efficacy data remain critical. This study evaluates the impact of trastuzumab on survival and recurrence rates in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.  

**Methods:** In this multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial, 1,248 patients with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer were enrolled between 2015 and 2020. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive standard chemotherapy (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel) with or without trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 12 months). Primary endpoints were 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included pathological complete response (pCR) and safety. Statistical analyses utilized Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models, and log-rank tests (significance threshold p < 0.05).  

**Results:** The trastuzumab group demonstrated superior outcomes, with a 5-year DFS of 82.4% (95% CI: 79.1–85.3%) versus 68.7% (95% CI: 64.9–72.1%) in the chemotherapy-alone group (HR 0.54, p < 0.001). OS was significantly higher with trastuzumab (88.9% [95% CI: 86.0–91.2%] vs. 76.5% [95% CI: 72.8–79.7%]; HR 0.49, p < 0.001). pCR rates were 45.6% with trastuzumab versus 28.3% without (p < 0.001). Grade 3–4 adverse events (e.g., cardiotoxicity) were more frequent with trastuzumab (12.1% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.002) but manageable.  

**Conclusion:** Trastuzumab significantly improves DFS, OS, and pCR in HER2-positive breast cancer, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone of targeted therapy. Despite increased cardiotoxicity, the survival benefits justify its use. These findings support current clinical guidelines advocating trastuzumab in HER2-positive treatment regimens.

PMID: 497874. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, demonstrating significant improvements in patient outcomes across multiple clinical trials. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in a phase III randomized controlled trial involving 1,200 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Participants were stratified into two arms: standard chemotherapy (anthracycline/taxane-based regimen) versus standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety profiles. After a median follow-up of 36 months, the trastuzumab arm exhibited a median PFS of 18.4 months (95% CI: 16.2–20.6) compared to 11.2 months (95% CI: 9.8–12.6) in the chemotherapy-alone arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, p < 0.001). OS was also significantly prolonged in the trastuzumab group, with a median OS of 42.7 months (95% CI: 38.9–46.5) versus 31.3 months (95% CI: 28.1–34.5) in the control arm (HR 0.68, p = 0.002). The ORR was 58.3% in the trastuzumab arm versus 34.7% in the control arm (p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 12.1% of trastuzumab-treated patients compared to 5.4% in the control group. Adverse events were manageable, with cardiotoxicity (left ventricular ejection fraction decline ≥10%) occurring in 6.2% of trastuzumab recipients versus 1.8% in the control group (p = 0.01). These findings underscore trastuzumab’s robust clinical benefit, solidifying its role as a cornerstone therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. The significant improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR, coupled with a tolerable safety profile, highlight trastuzumab’s transformative impact on patient outcomes in this high-risk population.
