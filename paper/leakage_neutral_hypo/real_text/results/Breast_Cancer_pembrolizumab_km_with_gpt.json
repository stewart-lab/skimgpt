                "Score: -2  \nReasoning:  \nA number of abstracts directly contradict the notion that pembrolizumab has \u201cno effect\u201d in breast cancer. For example, PMID: 32101663 (KEYNOTE-522) reports that adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy significantly increased the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response (64.8% vs 51.2%, P<0.001). This is clear evidence of therapeutic benefit. Similarly, early-phase studies described in PMID: 27138582 (KEYNOTE-012) and PMID: 30475947 (KEYNOTE-086 cohort B) show measurable response rates (e.g., 18.5% in KEYNOTE-012 and 21.4% in KEYNOTE-086 cohort B) and durable antitumor activity in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Although one trial (PMID: 33676601, KEYNOTE-119) did not meet its primary endpoint in the overall population, it suggested possible benefit in certain subgroups (e.g., PD-L1-enriched subsets). Taken together, this evidence shows that pembrolizumab can and does produce meaningful effects on breast cancer outcomes, thereby refuting the hypothesis that it has no effect."

In this study, we compared pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for second-line or third-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. KEYNOTE-119 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 150 medical centres (academic medical centres, community cancer centres, and community hospitals) in 31 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, with centrally confirmed metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, who had received one or two previous systemic treatments for metastatic disease, had progression on their most recent therapy, and had previous treatment with an anthracycline or taxane were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a block method (block size of four) and an interactive voice-response system with integrated web-response to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles (pembrolizumab group), or to single-drug chemotherapy per investigator's choice of capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine (60% enrolment cap for each; chemotherapy group). Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 tumour status (positive [combined positive score (CPS) \u22651] vs negative [CPS <1]) and history of previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment versus de-novo metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Primary endpoints were overall survival in participants with a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more, those with a CPS of 1 or more, and all participants; superiority of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was tested in all participants only if shown in those with a CPS of one or more. The primary endpoint was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was analysed in the all-subjects-as-treated population. This Article describes the final analysis of the trial, which is now completed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02555657. From Nov 25, 2015, to April 11, 2017, 1098 participants were assessed for eligibility and 622 (57%) were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab (312 [50%]) or chemotherapy (310 [50%]). Median study follow-up was 31\u00b74 months (IQR 27\u00b78-34\u00b74) for the pembrolizumab group and 31\u00b75 months (27\u00b78-34\u00b76) for the chemotherapy group. Median overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more was 12\u00b77 months (95% CI 9\u00b79-16\u00b73) for the pembrolizumab group and 11\u00b76 months (8\u00b73-13\u00b77) for the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b778 [95% CI 0\u00b757-1\u00b706]; log-rank p=0\u00b7057). In participants with a CPS of 1 or more, median overall survival was 10\u00b77 months (9\u00b73-12\u00b75) for the pembrolizumab group and 10\u00b72 months (7\u00b79-12\u00b76) for the chemotherapy group (HR 0\u00b786 [95% CI 0\u00b769-1\u00b706]; log-rank p=0\u00b7073). In the overall population, median overall survival was 9\u00b79 months (95% CI 8\u00b73-11\u00b74) for the pembrolizumab group and 10\u00b78 months (9\u00b71-12\u00b76) for the chemotherapy group (HR 0\u00b797 [95% CI 0\u00b782-1\u00b715]). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (three [1%] patients in the pembrolizumab group vs ten [3%] in the chemotherapy group), decreased white blood cells (one [<1%] vs 14 [5%]), decreased neutrophil count (one [<1%] vs 29 [10%]), and neutropenia (0 vs 39 [13%]). 61 (20%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 58 (20%) patients in the chemotherapy group had serious adverse events. Three (<1%) of 601 participants had treatment-related adverse events that led to death (one [<1%] in the pembrolizumab group due to circulatory collapse; two [1%] in the chemotherapy group, one [<1%] due to pancytopenia and sepsis and one [<1%] haemothorax). Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer versus chemotherapy. These findings might inform future research of pembrolizumab monotherapy for selected subpopulations of patients, specifically those with PD-L1-enriched tumours, and inform a combinatorial approach for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

Several lines of evidence support the study of immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We assessed the safety and antitumor activity of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with advanced TNBC. KEYNOTE-012 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01848834) was a multicenter, nonrandomized phase Ib trial of single-agent pembrolizumab given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks to patients with advanced PD-L1-positive (expression in stroma or \u2265 1% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry) TNBC, gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, and head and neck cancer. This report focuses on the TNBC cohort. Among 111 patients with TNBC whose tumor samples were screened for PD-L1 expression, 58.6% had PD-L1-positive tumors. Thirty-two women (median age, 50.5 years; range, 29 to 72 years) were enrolled and assessed for safety and antitumor activity. The median number of doses administered was five (range, 1 to 36 doses). Common toxicities were mild and similar to those observed in other tumor cohorts (eg, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea), and included five (15.6%) patients with grade \u2265 3 toxicity and one treatment-related death. Among the 27 patients who were evaluable for antitumor activity, the overall response rate was 18.5%, the median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range, 7.3 to 32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range, 15.0 to \u2265 47.3 weeks). This phase Ib study describes preliminary evidence of clinical activity and a potentially acceptable safety profile of pembrolizumab given every 2 weeks to patients with heavily pretreated, advanced TNBC. A single-agent phase II study examining a 200-mg dose given once every 3 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02447003) is ongoing.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32101663\nTitle: Pembrolizumab for Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: Previous trials showed promising antitumor activity and an acceptable safety profile associated with pembrolizumab in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer. Whether the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy would significantly increase the percentage of patients with early triple-negative breast cancer who have a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes) at definitive surgery is unclear. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (784 patients; the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (390 patients; the placebo-chemotherapy group); the two groups then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo, and both groups received doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, the patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were a pathological complete response at the time of definitive surgery and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. At the first interim analysis, among the first 602 patients who underwent randomization, the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 64.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.9 to 69.5) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 51.2% (95% CI, 44.1 to 58.3) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (estimated treatment difference, 13.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.4 to 21.8; P<0.001). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2.7 to 25.0), 58 of 784 patients (7.4%) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 46 of 390 patients (11.8%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group had disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, had local or distant recurrence or a second primary tumor, or died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.93). Across all treatment phases, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 78.0% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 73.0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% (3 patients) and 0.3% (1 patient), respectively. Among patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, the percentage with a pathological complete response was significantly higher among those who received pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy than among those who received placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

In cohort A of the phase II KEYNOTE-086 study, we evaluated pembrolizumab as second or later line of treatment for patients with mTNBC. Eligible patients had centrally confirmed mTNBC, \u22651 systemic therapy for metastatic disease, prior treatment with anthracycline and taxane in any disease setting, and progression on or after the most recent therapy. Patients received pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg intravenously every 3\u2009weeks for up to 2\u2009years. Primary end points were objective response rate in the total and PD-L1-positive populations, and safety. Secondary end points included duration of response, disease control rate (percentage of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease for \u226524\u2009weeks), progression-free survival, and overall survival. All enrolled patients (N\u2009=\u2009170) were women, 61.8% had PD-L1-positive tumors, and 43.5% had received \u22653 previous lines of therapy for metastatic disease. ORR (95% CI) was 5.3% (2.7-9.9) in the total and 5.7% (2.4-12.2) in the PD-L1-positive populations. Disease control rate (95% CI) was 7.6% (4.4-12.7) and 9.5% (5.1-16.8), respectively. Median duration of response was not reached in the total (range, 1.2+-21.5+) and in the PD-L1-positive (range, 6.3-21.5+) populations. Median PFS was 2.0\u2009months (95% CI, 1.9-2.0), and the 6-month rate was 14.9%. Median OS was 9.0\u2009months (95% CI, 7.6-11.2), and the 6-month rate was 69.1%. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 103 (60.6%) patients, including 22 (12.9%) with grade 3 or 4 AEs. There were no deaths due to AEs. Pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated durable antitumor activity in a subset of patients with previously treated mTNBC and had a manageable safety profile.

However, outcomes are poor, and new treatment options are needed. In cohort B of the phase II KEYNOTE-086 study, we evaluated pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for patients with PD-L1-positive mTNBC. Eligible patients had centrally confirmed mTNBC, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for metastatic disease, measurable disease at baseline per RECIST v1.1 by central review, no radiographic evidence of central nervous system metastases, and a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score \u22651. Patients received pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg intravenously every 3\u2009weeks for up to 2\u2009years. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included objective response rate, disease control rate (percentage of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease for \u226524\u2009weeks), duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. All 84 patients enrolled were women, and 73 (86.9%) received prior (neo)adjuvant therapy. Fifty-three (63.1%) patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs), including 8 patients (9.5%) with grade 3 severity; no patients experienced grade 4 AEs or died because of treatment-related AEs. Four patients had a complete response and 14 had a partial response, for an objective response rate of 21.4% (95% CI 13.9-31.4). Of the 13 patients with stable disease, 2 had stable disease lasting \u226524\u2009weeks, for a disease control rate of 23.8% (95% CI 15.9-34.0). At data cut-off, 8 of 18 (44.4%) responses were ongoing, and median duration of response was 10.4\u2009months (range 4.2 to 19.2+). Median progression-free survival was 2.1\u2009months (95% CI 2.0-2.2), and median overall survival was 18.0\u2009months (95% CI 12.9-23.0). Pembrolizumab monotherapy had a manageable safety profile and showed durable antitumor activity as first-line therapy for patients with PD-L1-positive mTNBC.
