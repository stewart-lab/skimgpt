                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAll five abstracts consistently report evidence that alpelisib exerts a positive impact on outcomes in patients with breast cancer, directly contradicting the hypothesis that \u201cTreatment with alpelisib has no effect on Breast Cancer patient outcomes.\u201d  \n\nFor example, PMID: 33794206 reports that \u201cBYLieve showed activity of alpelisib plus fulvestrant\u201d in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer, thus demonstrating a beneficial effect. PMID: 31091374 (SOLAR-1 trial) shows statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival for patients receiving alpelisib, further indicating meaningful clinical benefit. Additional studies, such as PMID: 27126994, observed objective responses and an elevated clinical benefit rate for alpelisib combinations, and PMID: 29401002 likewise describes \u201cencouraging preliminary activity\u201d in PIK3CA-altered solid tumors, including breast cancer. Finally, PMID: 26793003 reiterates preliminary antitumor activity from early clinical studies of PI3K inhibitors, including alpelisib. Taken together, these findings show that alpelisib produces measurable anticancer effects; consequently, the hypothesis that alpelisib has no effect is strongly refuted."

BYLieve aimed to assess alpelisib plus endocrine therapy in this setting in three cohorts defined by immediate previous treatment; here, we report results from cohort A. This ongoing, phase 2, multicentre, open-label, non-comparative study enrolled patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer with tumour PIK3CA mutation, following progression on or after previous therapy, including CDK4/6 inhibitors, from 114 study locations (cancer centres, medical centres, university hospitals, and hospitals) in 18 countries worldwide. Participants aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, with no more than two previous anticancer treatments and no more than one previous chemotherapy regimen, were enrolled in three cohorts. In cohort A, patients must have had progression on or after a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor as the immediate previous treatment. Patients received oral alpelisib 300 mg/day (continuously) plus fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly on day 1 of each 28-day cycle and on day 15 of cycle 1. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive without disease progression at 6 months per local assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, in patients with a centrally confirmed PIK3CA mutation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03056755. Between Aug 14, 2017, and Dec 17, 2019 (data cutoff), 127 patients with at least 6 months' follow-up were enrolled into cohort A. 121 patients had a centrally confirmed PIK3CA mutation. At data cutoff, median follow-up was 11\u00b77 months (IQR 8\u00b75-15\u00b79). 61 (50\u00b74%; 95% CI 41\u00b72-59\u00b76) of 121 patients were alive without disease progression at 6 months. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were hyperglycaemia (36 [28%] of 127 patients), rash (12 [9%]), and rash maculopapular (12 [9%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 33 (26%) of 127 patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. BYLieve showed activity of alpelisib plus fulvestrant with manageable toxicity in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, after progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor.

The PI3K\u03b1-specific inhibitor alpelisib has shown antitumor activity in early studies. In a randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared alpelisib (at a dose of 300 mg per day) plus fulvestrant (at a dose of 500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, in the cohort with <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cancer; progression-free survival was also analyzed in the cohort without <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cancer. Secondary end points included overall response and safety. A total of 572 patients underwent randomization, including 341 patients with confirmed tumor-tissue <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations. In the cohort of patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5 to 14.5) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.85; P<0.001); in the cohort without <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cancer, the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.25; posterior probability of hazard ratio <1.00, 79.4%). Overall response among all the patients in the cohort without <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cancer was greater with alpelisib-fulvestrant than with placebo-fulvestrant (26.6% vs. 12.8%); among patients with measurable disease in this cohort, the percentages were 35.7% and 16.2%, respectively. In the overall population, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hyperglycemia (36.6% in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group vs. 0.7% in the placebo-fulvestrant group) and rash (9.9% vs. 0.3%). Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7% of patients in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3% of those in the placebo-fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported. The percentages of patients who discontinued alpelisib and placebo owing to adverse events were 25.0% and 4.2%, respectively. Treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously.

This phase Ib study evaluated alpelisib plus letrozole's safety, tolerability, and preliminary activity in patients with metastatic ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy. Twenty-six patients received letrozole and alpelisib daily. Outcomes were assessed by standard solid-tumor phase I methods. Tumor blocks were collected for DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing. Alpelisib's maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with letrozole was 300 mg/d. Common drug-related adverse events included hyperglycemia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and rash with dose-limiting toxicity occurring at 350 mg/d of alpelisib. The clinical benefit rate (lack of progression \u22656 months) was 35% (44% in patients with PIK3CA-mutated and 20% in PIK3CA wild-type tumors; 95% CI, 17%-56%), including five objective responses. Of eight patients remaining on treatment \u226512 months, six had tumors with a PIK3CA mutation. Among evaluable tumors, those with FGFR1/2 amplification and KRAS and TP53 mutations did not derive clinical benefit. Overexpression of FGFR1 in ER<sup>+</sup>/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells attenuated the response to alpelisib in vitro CONCLUSIONS: The combination of letrozole and alpelisib was safe, with reversible toxicities. Clinical activity was observed independently of PIK3CA mutation status, although clinical benefit was seen in a higher proportion of patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumors. Phase II and III trials of alpelisib and endocrine therapy in patients with ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer are ongoing.

Patients and Methods In the dose-escalation phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered advanced solid tumors received once-daily or twice-daily oral alpelisib on a continuous schedule. In the dose-expansion phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors and PIK3CA-wild-type, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer received alpelisib 400 mg once daily. Results One hundred thirty-four patients received treatment. Alpelisib maximum tolerated doses were established as 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice daily. Nine patients (13.2%) in the dose-escalation phase had dose-limiting toxicities of hyperglycemia (n = 6), nausea (n = 2), and both hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia (n = 1). Frequent all-grade, treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia (51.5%), nausea (50.0%), decreased appetite (41.8%), diarrhea (40.3%), and vomiting (31.3%). Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed; half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation. Objective tumor responses were observed at doses \u2265 270 mg once daily; overall response rate was 6.0% (n = 8; one patient with endometrial cancer had a complete response, and seven patients with cervical, breast, endometrial, colon, and rectal cancers had partial responses). Stable disease was achieved in 70 (52.2%) patients and was maintained > 24 weeks in 13 (9.7%) patients; disease control rate (complete and partial responses and stable disease) was 58.2%. In patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Frequently mutated genes (\u2265 10% tumors) included TP53 (51.3%), APC (23.7%), KRAS (22.4%), ARID1A (13.2%), and FBXW7 (10.5%). Conclusion Alpelisib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and encouraging preliminary activity in patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors, supporting the rationale for selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibition in combination with other agents for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant tumors.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26793003\nTitle: PI3K inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics: implications for clinical trial design.\nAbstract: The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is frequently activated in cancer. PI3K inhibitors, including the pan-PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) and the PI3K\u03b1-selective inhibitor alpelisib (BYL719), currently in clinical development by Novartis Oncology, may therefore be effective as anticancer agents. Early clinical studies with PI3K inhibitors have demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity and acceptable safety profiles. However, a number of unanswered questions regarding PI3K inhibition in cancer remain, including: what is the best approach for different tumor types, and which biomarkers will accurately identify the patient populations most likely to benefit from specific PI3K inhibitors? This review summarizes the strategies being employed by Novartis Oncology to help maximize the benefits of clinical studies with buparlisib and alpelisib, including stratification according to PI3K pathway activation status, selective enrollment/target enrichment (where patients with PI3K pathway-activated tumors are specifically recruited), nonselective enrollment with mandatory tissue collection, and enrollment of patients who have progressed on previous targeted agents, such as mTOR inhibitors or endocrine therapy. An overview of Novartis-sponsored and Novartis-supported trials that are utilizing these approaches in a range of cancer types, including breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, lymphoma, and glioblastoma multiforme, is also described.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 33794206, 31091374, 27126994, 29401002, 26793003\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and alpelisib. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and alpelisib. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
