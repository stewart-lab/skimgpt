                "Score: -2  \nReasoning:  \nEvidence from multiple abstracts, including phase 3 trial data, clearly indicates that talazoparib (talazoparib tosylate) significantly improves outcomes for patients with breast cancer, such as prolonged progression-free survival and higher objective response rates relative to standard chemotherapy (PMID: 30110579). For instance, in a randomized phase 3 study, talazoparib provided a notable improvement in progression-free survival (8.6 vs. 5.6 months) and an increased objective response rate (62.6% vs. 27.2%). These efficacy findings directly contradict the hypothesis that \u201ctreatment with talazoparib tosylate has no effect on Breast Cancer patient outcomes.\u201d Additional updates and overviews (PMID: 33710534, PMID: 32029455, PMID: 30518089) and the initial discovery and characterization data (PMID: 26652717) further support the beneficial effect of talazoparib in breast cancer, thus refuting the hypothesis."

These BC susceptibility genes encode proteins critical for DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR). This review provides an update on oral poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for the treatment of BC. Olaparib and talazoparib are PARP inhibitors approved as monotherapies for deleterious/suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative BC. Olaparib is approved in the USA for metastatic BC and in Europe for locally advanced/metastatic BC. Talazoparib is approved for locally advanced/metastatic BC in the USA and Europe. In phase 3 trials, olaparib and talazoparib monotherapies demonstrated significant progression-free survival benefits compared with chemotherapy. Common toxicities were effectively managed by supportive treatment and dose interruptions/reductions. Veliparib combined with platinum-based chemotherapy has also shown promise for locally advanced/metastatic BC in a phase 3 trial. Differences in efficacy and safety across PARP inhibitors (olaparib, talazoparib, veliparib, niraparib, rucaparib) may relate to differences in potency of PARP trapping on DNA and cytotoxic specificity. PARP inhibitors are being investigated in early BC, in novel combinations, and in patients without germline BRCA mutations, including those with somatic BRCA mutations and other HRR gene mutations. Ongoing phase 2/3 studies include PARP inhibitors combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of triple-negative BC. Wider access to testing for BRCA and other mutations, and to genetic counseling, are required to identify patients who could benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy. The advent of PARP inhibitors has potential benefits for BC treatment beyond the locally advanced/metastatic setting.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30110579\nTitle: Talazoparib in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer and a Germline BRCA Mutation.\nAbstract: The poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) inhibitor talazoparib has shown antitumor activity in patients with advanced breast cancer and germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( BRCA1/2). We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive talazoparib (1 mg once daily) or standard single-agent therapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine in continuous 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review. Of the 431 patients who underwent randomization, 287 were assigned to receive talazoparib and 144 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.71; P<0.001). The interim median hazard ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06; P=0.11 [57% of projected events]). The objective response rate was higher in the talazoparib group than in the standard-therapy group (62.6% vs. 27.2%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.8; P<0.001). Hematologic grade 3-4 adverse events (primarily anemia) occurred in 55% of the patients who received talazoparib and in 38% of the patients who received standard therapy; nonhematologic grade 3 adverse events occurred in 32% and 38% of the patients, respectively. Patient-reported outcomes favored talazoparib; significant overall improvements and significant delays in the time to clinically meaningful deterioration according to both the global health status-quality-of-life and breast symptoms scales were observed. Among patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation, single-agent talazoparib provided a significant benefit over standard chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival. Patient-reported outcomes were superior with talazoparib.

Amplifying genomic instability through radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been a powerful but nonselective means of killing cancer cells. Precision medicine has revolutionized cancer therapy by putting forth the concept of selective targeting of cancer cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a successful example of precision medicine as the first drugs targeting DNA damage response to have entered the clinic. PARP inhibitors act through synthetic lethality with mutations in DNA repair genes and were approved for the treatment of <i>BRCA</i> mutated ovarian and breast cancer. PARP inhibitors destabilize replication forks through PARP DNA entrapment and induce cell death through replication stress-induced mitotic catastrophe. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) exploit and exacerbate replication deficiencies of cancer cells and may complement PARP inhibitors in targeting a broad range of cancer types with different sources of genomic instability. Here I provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of PARP and PARG inhibition. I highlight clinical performance of four PARP inhibitors used in cancer therapy (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib) and discuss the predictive biomarkers of inhibitor sensitivity, mechanisms of resistance as well as the means of overcoming them through combination therapy.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30518089\nTitle: Role of BRCA Mutations in Cancer Treatment with Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitors.\nAbstract: Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity induces synthetic lethality in mutated BRCA1/2 cancers by selectively targeting tumor cells that fail to repair DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Clinical studies have confirmed the validity of the synthetic lethality approach and four different PARP inhibitors (PARPi; olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and talazoparib) have been approved as monotherapies for BRCA-mutated or platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer and/or for BRCA-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. PARPi therapeutic efficacy is higher against tumors harboring deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations than in BRCA wild-type tumors. BRCA mutations or intrinsic tumor sensitivity to platinum compounds are both regarded as indicators of deficiency in DSB repair by homologous recombination as well as of favorable response to PARPi. However, not all BRCA-mutated or platinum-responsive patients obtain clinical benefit from these agents. Conversely, a certain percentage of patients with wild-type BRCA or platinum-resistant tumors can still get benefit from PARPi. Thus, additional reliable markers need to be validated in clinical trials to select patients potentially eligible for PARPi-based therapies, in the absence of deleterious BRCA mutations or platinum sensitivity. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of action of PARPi and the clinical evidence supporting their use as anticancer drugs as well as the additional synthetic lethal partners that might confer sensitivity to PARPi in patients with wild-type BRCA tumors.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26652717\nTitle: Discovery and Characterization of (8S,9R)-5-Fluoro-8-(4-fluorophenyl)-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3-one (BMN 673, Talazoparib), a Novel, Highly Potent, and Orally Efficacious Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1/2 Inhibitor, as an Anticancer Agent.\nAbstract: We discovered and developed a novel series of tetrahydropyridophthlazinones as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 and 2 inhibitors. Lead optimization led to the identification of (8S,9R)-47 (talazoparib; BMN 673; (8S,9R)-5-fluoro-8-(4-fluorophenyl)-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3-one). The novel stereospecific dual chiral-center-embedded structure of this compound has enabled extensive and unique binding interactions with PARP1/2 proteins. (8S,9R)-47 demonstrates excellent potency, inhibiting PARP1 and PARP2 enzyme activity with Ki = 1.2 and 0.87 nM, respectively. It inhibits PARP-mediated PARylation in a whole-cell assay with an EC50 of 2.51 nM and prevents proliferation of cancer cells carrying mutant BRCA1/2, with EC50 = 0.3 nM (MX-1) and 5 nM (Capan-1), respectively. (8S,9R)-47 is orally available, displaying favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and remarkable antitumor efficacy in the BRCA1 mutant MX-1 breast cancer xenograft model following oral administration as a single-agent or in combination with chemotherapy agents such as temozolomide and cisplatin. (8S,9R)-47 has completed phase 1 clinical trial and is currently being studied in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for the treatment of locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 33710534, 30110579, 32029455, 30518089, 26652717\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and talazoparib tosylate. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and talazoparib tosylate. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
