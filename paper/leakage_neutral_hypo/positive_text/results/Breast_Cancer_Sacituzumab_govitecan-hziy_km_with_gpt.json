                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAcross all five provided abstracts (PMIDs: 699518, 172686, 269296, 670028, 813929), Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy consistently improved key clinical outcomes\u2014specifically progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR)\u2014in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. For example, PMID: 699518 reports significantly longer PFS (5.6 vs. 2.3 months), PMID: 172686 notes higher response rates (35% vs. 5%), and PMID: 269296 highlights improved survival (12.1 vs. ~7\u20138 months). Improved responses and survival contradict the hypothesis that Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has no effect on patient outcomes. Given that every study shows clear benefits over standard chemotherapy, the evidence uniformly refutes the hypothesis."

Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study evaluates its efficacy versus standard chemotherapy in patients with pretreated mTNBC.  \n\n**Population:** This multicenter, open-label, Phase III trial enrolled 468 patients with mTNBC who had received \u22652 prior systemic therapies (\u22651 for metastatic disease). Eligible participants had measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG performance status 0\u20131.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician\u2019s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine).  \n\n**Comparison:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Outcomes:** Median PFS was significantly longer with SG (5.6 months [95% CI: 4.3\u20136.9]) versus chemotherapy (2.3 months [95% CI: 1.8\u20133.2]; HR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.32\u20130.52; *p* < 0.001). SG also improved median OS (12.1 vs. 8.7 months; HR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.85; *p* = 0.002) and ORR (35% vs. 11%, *p* < 0.001). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more common with SG (64% vs. 52%), primarily neutropenia (42% vs. 28%) and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%), but were manageable with dose modifications.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in heavily pretreated mTNBC, establishing a new standard of care in this high-risk population.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 172686. **Title:** *Efficacy and Safety of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:** Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive biology and limited treatment options. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SG compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with pretreated mTNBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, 468 patients with mTNBC who had received \u22652 prior lines of therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** At a median follow-up of 18.7 months, SG significantly improved PFS compared to chemotherapy (median PFS: 5.6 vs. 1.7 months; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.52; p < 0.001). OS was also prolonged with SG (median OS: 12.1 vs. 6.7 months; HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.62; p < 0.001). The ORR was higher in the SG arm (35% vs. 5%, p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 4% of SG-treated patients. Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with SG (neutropenia: 51% vs. 33%; diarrhea: 10% vs. 1%), but discontinuation rates were similar (5% vs. 4%).  \n\n**Discussion:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in heavily pretreated mTNBC patients. The safety profile was manageable, with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity being the most common adverse events. These findings support SG as a new standard of care in this high-risk population. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and biomarker-driven subsets.  \n\n**Keywords:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, triple-negative breast cancer, Trop-2, antibody-drug conjugate, metastatic breast cancer\n\n---\n\nPMID: 269296. **Title:** *Efficacy and Safety of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:** Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive biology and limited treatment options. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SG compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with refractory mTNBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 468 patients with mTNBC who had received \u22652 prior systemic therapies were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided \u03b1 of 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer with SG (5.6 months [95% CI: 4.3\u20136.9]) versus chemotherapy (2.3 months [95% CI: 1.8\u20133.0]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% CI: 0.32\u20130.52; *p* < 0.001). OS was also improved (median 12.1 vs. 7.8 months; HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.49\u20130.78; *p* < 0.001). ORR was higher with SG (35% [95% CI: 29\u201341]) versus chemotherapy (11% [95% CI: 7\u201315]; *p* < 0.001). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 58% of SG-treated patients (vs. 47% with chemotherapy), with neutropenia (28%) and diarrhea (10%) being most common.  \n\n**Discussion:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard chemotherapy in pretreated mTNBC.

OS also favored SG (median 12.1 vs. 7.8 months; HR 0.62, *p* = 0.002). ORR was higher with SG (35.2% [95% CI: 29.5\u201341.2]) versus chemotherapy (10.7% [95% CI: 6.9\u201315.6]; *p* < 0.001).
