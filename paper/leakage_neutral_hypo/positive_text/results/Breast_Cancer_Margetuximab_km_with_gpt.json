                "Score: -2  \nReasoning:  \nAcross multiple abstracts (PMID: 324543, 897998, 764112, 188618, 309934), margetuximab demonstrates statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORR) when compared with trastuzumab in heavily pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients, refuting the idea that it has \u201cno effect.\u201d For example, PMID: 324543 shows a significant PFS advantage (5.8 vs. 4.9 months) in favor of margetuximab with corresponding improvements in ORR, and PMID: 764112 reports similar gains in PFS (5.8 vs. 4.9 months) and ORR with a consistent trend toward better overall survival. Likewise, PMID: 897998 highlights enhanced clinical benefit in patients carrying the CD16A-158F allele, further evidencing a meaningful immunomodulatory effect. None of the cited abstracts provide contradictory or neutral findings regarding margetuximab\u2019s effect on outcomes. Therefore, the hypothesis that \u201cTreatment with Margetuximab has no effect on Breast Cancer patient outcomes\u201d is consistently contradicted by the data, leading to the strongest refutation."

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 324543. Margetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), particularly in patients with refractory disease. This phase III, randomized, open-label study (NCT04262804) evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 18.7 months, margetuximab significantly improved PFS with a median of 5.8 months (95% CI: 5.5\u20136.9) versus 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.2\u20135.6) in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62\u20130.94; p=0.012). OS data, though immature, showed a trend toward benefit with margetuximab (median OS 21.6 months vs. 19.8 months; HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67\u20131.06; p=0.14). The ORR was 35.4% (95% CI: 30.1\u201340.9) in the margetuximab group versus 28.6% (95% CI: 23.5\u201334.1) in the trastuzumab group (p=0.048). Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced efficacy in patients with CD16A-158F alleles, supporting the immunomodulatory mechanism of margetuximab\u2019s optimized Fc domain. Treatment-related adverse events were comparable between arms, with grade \u22653 events occurring in 48.2% of margetuximab-treated patients versus 45.9% in the trastuzumab group. These findings establish margetuximab as a superior therapeutic option for HER2-positive MBC, particularly in heavily pretreated populations, with statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR, underscoring its potential to redefine standard care in this setting. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and combinatorial regimens.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 897998. Margetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), particularly in patients with refractory disease. This phase III, randomized, open-label study (SOPHIA trial, NCT02492711) evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies. The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review, was significantly improved in the margetuximab arm (median PFS 5.8 months vs. 4.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59\u20130.98, p=0.033). Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced benefit in patients carrying the CD16A-158F allele (median PFS 6.9 months vs. 5.1 months; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.90, p=0.005), underscoring the role of Fc optimization in improving antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Secondary endpoints, including overall response rate (ORR), favored margetuximab (22% vs. 16%, p=0.06), with a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) at interim analysis (median OS 21.6 months vs. 19.8 months; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69\u20131.13, p=0.33). Safety profiles were comparable between arms, with infusion-related reactions (13% vs. 3%) being more frequent with margetuximab but largely manageable. These findings establish margetuximab as a promising therapeutic option for HER2-positive MBC, particularly in patients with limited treatment alternatives, and highlight the importance of Fc receptor polymorphism in predicting clinical response. The study supports further investigation of margetuximab in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with novel HER2-targeted agents.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 764112.

Patients were stratified by prior lines of therapy (\u22642 vs. >2) and metastatic site involvement (visceral vs. non-visceral).  \n\n**Participants:** A total of 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received at least two prior anti-HER2 regimens, including pertuzumab and trastuzumab, were enrolled between January 2018 and June 2021. Eligible participants had an ECOG performance status of 0\u20131 and measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  \n\n**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (n=268) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (n=268). Chemotherapy regimens included vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine at investigator discretion.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the margetuximab arm compared to the trastuzumab arm (5.8 months vs. 4.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.63\u20130.92; p=0.006). OS data showed a trend favoring margetuximab (median OS 21.6 vs. 19.8 months; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70\u20131.03; p=0.08). ORR was higher with margetuximab (25.4% vs. 18.7%; p=0.03). Grade \u22653 adverse events were comparable between arms (48% vs. 45%), with no new safety signals observed.  \n\n**Conclusions:** Margetuximab significantly improved PFS and ORR compared to trastuzumab in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC patients, demonstrating clinically meaningful efficacy with a manageable safety profile. These findings support margetuximab as a promising therapeutic option for this patient population.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 309934. **Title: Margetuximab Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival and Overall Response Rates in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Background:** Despite advancements in HER2-targeted therapies, a significant proportion of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) experience disease progression. Margetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and may offer superior clinical benefits compared to existing therapies. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with pretreated HER2-positive MBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior trastuzumab and pertuzumab were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg q3w) plus chemotherapy (n=268) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg q3w) plus chemotherapy (n=268). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the margetuximab arm (6.9 months [95% CI: 5.8\u20138.2]) compared to the trastuzumab arm (5.1 months [95% CI: 4.1\u20135.6]; hazard ratio [HR]=0.71, 95% CI: 0.58\u20130.86; p=0.0006). The ORR was 35.8% (95% CI: 30.1\u201341.9) for margetuximab versus 28.6% (95% CI: 23.3\u201334.4; p=0.03) for trastuzumab. A trend toward improved OS was observed (median OS: 21.6 vs. 19.2 months; HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.67\u20131.03; p=0.09). Grade \u22653 adverse events were comparable between arms (48.5% vs. 46.7%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Margetuximab significantly improved PFS and ORR compared to trastuzumab in patients with pretreated HER2-positive MBC, demonstrating clinically meaningful efficacy with a manageable safety profile.
