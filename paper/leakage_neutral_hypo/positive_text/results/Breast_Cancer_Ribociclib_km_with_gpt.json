                "Score: -2  \nReasoning: All five abstracts consistently report that combining Ribociclib with endocrine therapy significantly improves outcomes in hormone receptor\u2013positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, directly refuting the hypothesis that Ribociclib has no effect on patient outcomes. Specifically, the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was significantly extended in the Ribociclib groups compared with controls in every trial (e.g., PMID: 513823, PMID: 372336, PMID: 399863, PMID: 635370). One study also showed a favorable trend in overall survival (PMID: 303702). Thus, these studies clearly indicate a beneficial effect of Ribociclib on breast cancer outcomes, contradicting the notion that it has no effect."

Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus ET versus ET alone in patients with HR+/HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 668 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test (two-sided \u03b1 = 0.05).  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the ribociclib combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to placebo (27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45\u20130.70; p < 0.0001). The 24-month PFS rate was 63.2% (95% CI 57.1\u201368.7) in the ribociclib group versus 42.1% (95% CI 36.0\u201348.1) in the placebo group. ORR was significantly higher with ribociclib (52.4% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.002). A trend toward improved OS was observed (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57\u20131.02; p = 0.06). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (59.3% vs. 0.9%) and leukopenia (21.1% vs. 0.5%), with no new safety signals identified.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Ribociclib in combination with letrozole significantly prolongs PFS and enhances tumor response in HR+/HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support ribociclib as a first-line treatment option in this patient population.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCT12345678\n\n---\n\nPMID: 372336. **Title:** Ribociclib in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer is the most common subtype of advanced breast cancer. Despite endocrine therapy (ET), disease progression remains a significant challenge. Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its impact on long-term clinical outcomes requires further validation. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus ET versus ET alone in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test (two-sided \u03b1 = 0.05).  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the ribociclib combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to ET alone (median PFS: 27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45\u20130.70; p < 0.001). The 24-month PFS rate was 63.2% (95% CI 57.1\u201368.8) in the ribociclib group versus 42.1% (95% CI 36.0\u201348.2) in the placebo group. ORR was significantly higher with ribociclib (52.4% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.003). OS data were immature but trended favorably (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54\u20131.06; p = 0.09). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (58.3%) and leukopenia (24.1%), manageable with dose adjustments.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Ribociclib in combination with letrozole significantly prolongs PFS in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, with a tolerable safety profile. These findings support ribociclib as a first-line treatment option in this population.

Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has emerged as a transformative therapy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. This multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone as first-line treatment in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. A total of 668 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 42.5 months, the ribociclib combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to letrozole alone (27.6 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45\u20130.70; p < 0.0001). OS data, though immature, showed a trend favoring ribociclib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.96; p = 0.021). The ORR was significantly higher in the ribociclib arm (52.7% vs. 37.1%; p = 0.001). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the ribociclib group were neutropenia (58.3%) and leukopenia (24.1%), which were manageable with dose adjustments. Quality-of-life assessments revealed no significant deterioration with ribociclib. These findings underscore ribociclib as a cornerstone therapy in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, offering a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS with a manageable safety profile. The data support the incorporation of ribociclib into standard first-line treatment regimens for this patient population. Further follow-up is warranted to confirm OS benefits.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 399863. **Title:** Ribociclib in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer remains a therapeutic challenge, with endocrine therapy (ET) resistance often limiting long-term efficacy. Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but robust clinical data are needed to confirm its impact on patient outcomes.  \n\n**Population:** This multicenter, phase III trial enrolled 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients in the experimental arm received oral ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day).  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received letrozole alone (2.5 mg/day).  \n\n**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 28.5 months, ribociclib plus letrozole demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to letrozole alone (27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45\u20130.70; *p* < 0.001). The 24-month PFS rate was 64.2% (95% CI 58.1\u201369.7) in the ribociclib group versus 42.7% (95% CI 36.5\u201348.8) in the control group. ORR was also higher with ribociclib (52.4% vs. 37.1%; *p* = 0.003). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward benefit (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55\u20131.05; *p* = 0.09). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the ribociclib arm were neutropenia (58.3%) and leukopenia (24.1%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Ribociclib in combination with letrozole significantly prolongs PFS and improves response rates in HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, establishing it as a first-line standard of care.

Ribociclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies by targeting cell cycle progression. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) compared to ET alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 668 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive either ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test with a two-sided \u03b1 of 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 28.5 months, the ribociclib-ET combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to ET alone (median PFS: 27.6 vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45\u20130.70; p < 0.001). The 24-month PFS rate was 64.2% (95% CI 58.5\u201369.9) in the ribociclib group versus 42.8% (95% CI 36.9\u201348.7) in the placebo group. ORR was significantly higher with ribociclib (52.3% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.002). OS data were immature but showed a favorable trend (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54\u20131.06; p = 0.09). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (58.3% vs. 1.2%) and leukopenia (21.5% vs. 0.6%), which were manageable with dose adjustments.  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nRibociclib in combination with ET significantly prolongs PFS in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, with a clinically meaningful 12.9-month improvement over ET alone. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies, supporting ribociclib as a first-line standard of care. These findings reinforce the pivotal role of CDK4/6 inhibition in improving outcomes for this patient population. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term OS benefits.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n*Keywords:* Ribociclib, CDK4/6 inhibitor, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, progression-free survival, endocrine therapy.\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 513823, 372336, 303702, 399863, 635370\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and Ribociclib. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and Ribociclib. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
