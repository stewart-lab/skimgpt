                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAll five abstracts consistently report significant improvements in key clinical endpoints (progression-free survival, overall survival, and objective response rate) for breast cancer patients treated with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), directly contradicting the hypothesis that T-DXd has no effect on outcomes.  \n\nSpecifically, PMID: 215488 indicates that T-DXd \u201csignificantly improved PFS and ORR\u201d compared to control. PMID: 260416 shows that T-DXd yielded higher PFS, OS, and ORR, identifying T-DXd as \u201ca new standard of care\u201d for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PMID: 572775 reports \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements\u201d in PFS and ORR, while PMID: 722292 further confirms these efficacy gains and extends them to include an OS benefit. Finally, PMID: 671546 details the DESTINY-Breast03 trial results, showing T-DXd \u201csuperior\u201d to trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in second-line therapy for HER2-positive MBC, with substantial improvements in PFS and OS. Taken together, these findings uniformly refute the hypothesis that T-DXd has no effect on breast cancer outcomes."

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combining a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of T-DXd compared to standard-of-care therapies in HER2-positive MBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received \u22652 prior HER2-directed regimens were randomized 2:1 to receive T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or physician\u2019s choice of therapy (trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib plus capecitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 16.2 months, T-DXd demonstrated superior PFS compared to the control arm (median PFS: 16.8 vs. 6.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35\u20130.58; *p* < 0.001). OS data were immature but showed a trend favoring T-DXd (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54\u20130.95; *p* = 0.018). The confirmed ORR was 62.5% (95% CI 56.8\u201368.0) in the T-DXd group versus 28.3% (95% CI 21.5\u201335.9) in the control group (*p* < 0.001). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 52.1% of T-DXd-treated patients (most commonly neutropenia [19.4%] and fatigue [10.2%]), with interstitial lung disease (ILD) reported in 10.5% (2.7% grade \u22653).  \n\n**Conclusion:** T-DXd significantly improved PFS and ORR compared to standard therapies in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC, establishing a new benchmark for efficacy. While manageable, the risk of ILD warrants careful monitoring. These findings support T-DXd as a preferred therapeutic option in this population.  \n\n**Keywords:** HER2-positive breast cancer, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, antibody-drug conjugate, metastatic breast cancer, progression-free survival.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 260416. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Background:** Despite advances in HER2-targeted therapies, a significant proportion of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) experience disease progression. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate, has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd compared to standard-of-care therapies in HER2-positive MBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this open-label, multicenter, phase III trial, 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received \u22652 prior HER2-directed regimens were randomized 1:1 to receive T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or physician\u2019s choice of therapy (trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib plus capecitabine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, T-DXd demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to the control arm (median PFS: 16.8 vs. 6.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35\u20130.58; p < 0.001). OS data were immature but favored T-DXd (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54\u20130.95; p = 0.02). The ORR was significantly higher with T-DXd (67.1% vs. 30.9%; p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 12.4% of T-DXd patients versus 2.1% in the control group. Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 52.3% of T-DXd patients (most commonly neutropenia [19.8%] and fatigue [10.2%]) versus 49.7% in the control arm. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) of any grade occurred in 10.5% of T-DXd patients (2.1% Grade \u22653).  \n\n**Conclusion:** T-DXd significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared to standard therapies in HER2-positive MBC, establishing it as a superior treatment option in this population. While manageable, vigilance for ILD is warranted. These findings support the use of T-DXd as a new standard of care for refractory HER2-positive MBC.  \n\n**Keywords:** HER2-positive breast cancer; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki; antibody-drug conjugate; metastatic breast cancer; progression-free survival.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 572775. **Title**: Efficacy and Safety of Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have progressed on prior anti-HER2 therapies.  \n\n**Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial comparing T-DXd to physician\u2019s choice of treatment (lapatinib plus capecitabine or trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1]). Patients were stratified by prior T-DM1 use and visceral metastasis status.  \n\n**Participants**: A total of 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled across 87 sites. Eligible participants had received \u22652 prior anti-HER2 regimens and had measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  \n\n**Interventions**: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or control therapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures**: Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results**: Median PFS was significantly longer with T-DXd (16.8 months [95% CI, 14.5\u201319.5]) vs. control (6.9 months [95% CI, 5.5\u20138.3]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.29\u20130.49; p < 0.0001). ORR was 62.3% (95% CI, 56.1\u201368.2) with T-DXd vs. 24.7% (95% CI, 19.2\u201330.8) with control (p < 0.001). Interim OS analysis favored T-DXd (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.87; p = 0.003). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 52.1% of T-DXd patients (vs. 48.9% control), with interstitial lung disease (13.6%) being the most notable T-DXd-related toxicity.  \n\n**Conclusions**: T-DXd demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and ORR compared to standard therapies in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC, establishing it as a superior treatment option.

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd) has emerged as a transformative therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), demonstrating significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to standard treatments. In the phase III DESTINY-Breast03 trial, 524 patients with HER2-positive MBC previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane were randomized to receive either T-DXd or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary endpoint, median PFS assessed by blinded independent central review, was not reached in the T-DXd arm (95% CI, 18.5\u2013not estimable) versus 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6\u20138.2) in the T-DM1 arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22\u20130.37; p < 0.0001). At 12 months, the PFS rate was 75.8% (95% CI, 69.8\u201380.7) for T-DXd versus 34.1% (95% CI, 27.7\u201340.5) for T-DM1. Interim OS analysis also favored T-DXd, with a 12-month survival rate of 94.1% (95% CI, 90.3\u201396.4) versus 85.9% (95% CI, 80.9\u201389.7) for T-DM1 (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36\u20130.86; p = 0.007). Objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher with T-DXd (79.7% [95% CI, 74.3\u201384.4]) versus T-DM1 (34.2% [95% CI, 28.5\u201340.3]; p < 0.0001), with complete responses observed in 16.1% versus 8.7% of patients, respectively. The safety profile of T-DXd was manageable, with interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurring in 10.5% of patients (grade \u22653 in 2.6%). These data establish T-DXd as a superior second-line therapy for HER2-positive MBC, with unprecedented efficacy and durable responses, underscoring its potential to redefine treatment paradigms. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and HER2-low breast cancer.\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 215488, 260416, 572775, 722292, 671546\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
