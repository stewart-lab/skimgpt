                "Score: -2  \nReasoning: All five abstracts consistently show a beneficial effect of Elacestrant on breast cancer outcomes, directly contradicting the hypothesis that Elacestrant has no effect. Specifically:\n\n\u2022 PMID: 304457 reports improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to standard therapy.  \n\u2022 PMID: 497111 describes a significant improvement in PFS (5.7 vs. 3.2 months), with further benefit in ESR1-mutated tumors, and a higher ORR in the Elacestrant arm.  \n\u2022 PMID: 880853 again demonstrates a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and ORR.  \n\u2022 PMID: 467827 finds Elacestrant significantly improves PFS compared to standard therapy (5.7 vs. 3.2 months).  \n\u2022 PMID: 642174 shows a marked benefit in PFS, especially in patients with ESR1 mutations, and an ORR advantage for Elacestrant.  \n\nThese data contradict the hypothesis of \u201cno effect\u201d by consistently showing that Elacestrant improves patient outcomes, such as PFS and ORR, in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. For an undergraduate biochemist, the step-by-step logic is as follows: (1) each study tested Elacestrant in a randomized controlled setting; (2) each reported longer time to disease progression (PFS) compared with standard endocrine therapy; (3) multiple studies also reported a higher proportion of patients whose tumors shrank (ORR); (4) these results persist across different subgroups, including those with known difficult-to-treat ESR1 mutations; (5) collectively, these consistent findings mean Elacestrant is effective rather than ineffective. Therefore, the original hypothesis that Elacestrant has no effect is refuted by the evidence."

Elacestrant, a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has shown promise in early-phase trials. This study evaluates its efficacy and safety compared to standard-of-care endocrine monotherapy.  \n\n**Population:** Postmenopausal women (n=478) with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapy and 1\u20132 lines of endocrine treatment.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral Elacestrant (400 mg daily) or investigator\u2019s choice of standard endocrine therapy (fulvestrant 500 mg or aromatase inhibitor).  \n\n**Comparison:** Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed as the primary endpoint, with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Outcomes:** Elacestrant demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to standard therapy (5.7 months vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52\u20130.86; p=0.002). Subgroup analyses showed consistent benefit across prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure and metastatic sites. The 12-month PFS rate was 22.3% for Elacestrant versus 9.1% for standard therapy (p<0.001). ORR was 12.4% vs. 6.7% (p=0.03). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were manageable, with nausea (27%) and fatigue (18%) being most common. Grade \u22653 TEAEs occurred in 25% of Elacestrant-treated patients versus 21% in the control arm.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Elacestrant significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after CDK4/6 inhibitor failure, establishing it as a promising therapeutic option. These findings support its integration into the treatment paradigm for endocrine-resistant disease.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 497111. **Title: Elacestrant Demonstrates Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival and Overall Response Rates in Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:**  \nElacestrant, a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has emerged as a promising therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, particularly in patients with ESR1 mutations who exhibit resistance to prior endocrine therapies. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of elacestrant compared to standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine monotherapy in this patient population.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, open-label trial, 478 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy + CDK4/6 inhibitors were randomized 1:1 to receive either elacestrant (345 mg orally daily) or SOC (fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly or aromatase inhibitor). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. ESR1 mutation status was assessed via circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Statistical analysis employed Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAt a median follow-up of 14.2 months, elacestrant significantly improved median PFS compared to SOC (5.7 months vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46\u20130.75; p < 0.001). In the ESR1-mutated subgroup (n = 228), the benefit was more pronounced (median PFS 7.1 months vs. 2.8 months; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.63; p < 0.001). ORR was higher with elacestrant (12.4% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.003). Grade \u22653 adverse events were comparable (23% vs. 21%), with nausea (27%) and fatigue (18%) being the most common in the elacestrant arm.  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nElacestrant demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and ORR over SOC, particularly in ESR1-mutated tumors, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support elacestrant as a new standard of care for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, especially in patients with endocrine resistance driven by ESR1 mutations. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in earlier lines of therapy and combination regimens.  \n\n**Keywords:** Elacestrant, SERD, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, ESR1 mutation, endocrine resistance, progression-free survival.  \n\n(Word count: 298)\n\n---\n\nPMID: 880853. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Elacestrant in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:** Elacestrant, a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has emerged as a promising therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, particularly in patients with ESR1 mutations who progress on prior endocrine therapy.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either elacestrant (345 mg orally once daily) or investigator\u2019s choice of fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or aromatase inhibitor (AI). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. ESR1 mutation status was analyzed in circulating tumor DNA.  \n\n**Results:** At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, elacestrant significantly improved PFS compared to standard therapy (median PFS: 5.7 vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% CI 0.51\u20130.80; p < 0.001). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with ESR1 mutations (median PFS: 6.8 vs. 2.1 months; HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32\u20130.63; p < 0.001). ORR was higher with elacestrant (12.4% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.03). OS data were immature but trended favorably (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.62\u20131.08; p = 0.15). The most common adverse events with elacestrant were nausea (32%), fatigue (24%), and arthralgia (18%), with no new safety signals identified.  \n\n**Discussion:** Elacestrant demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS over standard endocrine therapy, particularly in ESR1-mutated tumors, with a manageable safety profile.

Elacestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), has shown promise in preclinical studies by effectively targeting ESR1 mutations. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of elacestrant compared to standard endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, 478 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior ET and CDK4/6 inhibitors were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either elacestrant (345 mg orally daily) or investigator\u2019s choice of fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or aromatase inhibitor (AI). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** At a median follow-up of 14.2 months, elacestrant demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to standard ET (median PFS: 5.7 months vs. 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48\u20130.79; p < 0.001). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with ESR1 mutations (median PFS: 6.8 months vs. 2.1 months; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.64; p < 0.001).
