                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \n\nFrom the five abstracts (PMID: 375804, 765924, 675630, 647667, 817864), there is consistent evidence that pembrolizumab does not improve survival outcomes in breast cancer. All trials reported no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) when pembrolizumab was added to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (PMID: 375804, 765924, 675630, 647667, 817864). Even in subgroups defined by PD-L1 expression, no improvement was observed (PMID: 675630, 647667, 817864).  \n\nAlthough the addition of pembrolizumab increased toxicity (PMID: 375804, 765924, 675630, 647667, 817864), this adverse effect does not contradict the hypothesis that pembrolizumab has \u201cno effect on patient outcomes\u201d when judged primarily by survival metrics (PFS and OS). Rather, each publication consistently shows an absence of significant PFS or OS benefit, thereby supporting the hypothesis that treatment with pembrolizumab confers no meaningful improvement in breast cancer patient outcomes in these unselected populations. There is no contradictory evidence suggesting a survival advantage. Consequently, the hypothesis is well supported by the provided data, leading to the +2 score."

This study evaluated the clinical outcomes of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Population:** A total of 320 patients with histologically confirmed, PD-L1-positive (Combined Positive Score \u22651) metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either pembrolizumab plus standard chemotherapy (n=160) or chemotherapy alone (n=160). Median age was 54 years (range 29\u201372), and 78% had hormone receptor-negative disease.  \n\n**Intervention:** The experimental arm received pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or capecitabine). The control arm received chemotherapy alone. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Comparison:** Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the pembrolizumab-combination and chemotherapy-alone arms using a Cox proportional hazards model.  \n\n**Outcomes:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the pembrolizumab and control arms (median PFS 6.4 vs. 6.1 months; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74\u20131.15, p=0.47). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS 18.7 vs. 17.9 months; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79\u20131.22, p=0.86). Objective response rates were comparable (34.5% vs. 31.2%, p=0.52). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with pembrolizumab (58% vs. 42%, p=0.02), primarily due to immune-related toxicities.  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized trial, pembrolizumab did not significantly improve PFS or OS in patients with advanced breast cancer, despite increased toxicity. These findings suggest limited benefit of PD-1 inhibition in unselected PD-L1-positive breast cancer populations. Further biomarker-driven studies are warranted.  \n\n**Keywords:** Pembrolizumab, breast cancer, immunotherapy, PD-1 inhibitor, randomized controlled trial\n\n---\n\nPMID: 765924. **Title: Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), have shown promise in various malignancies, but their role in breast cancer remains controversial. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 450 patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the pembrolizumab arm showed no significant improvement in PFS compared to the placebo arm (median PFS 6.4 vs. 6.1 months; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.11; p = 0.37). Similarly, OS did not differ between groups (median OS 18.5 vs. 17.9 months; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79\u20131.14; p = 0.54). ORR was comparable (32.1% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.42). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with pembrolizumab (58% vs. 49%), including immune-related toxicities such as colitis (8% vs. 2%) and pneumonitis (5% vs. 1%).  \n\n**Discussion:** Despite preclinical rationale, pembrolizumab did not significantly improve outcomes in advanced breast cancer when added to chemotherapy. The lack of benefit, coupled with increased toxicity, suggests limited utility in unselected populations. Biomarker-driven studies may be warranted to identify potential responders.  \n\n**Trial Registration:** ClinicalTrials.gov NCTXXXXXX.  \n\n**Keywords:** Pembrolizumab, breast cancer, immunotherapy, PD-1 inhibitor, randomized controlled trial.  \n\n(Word count: 270)\n\n---\n\nPMID: 675630. **Title: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: No Significant Improvement in Progression-Free or Overall Survival**  \n\n**Objective:** To assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in combination with standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 expression (CPS \u22651 vs. <1) and prior systemic therapy.  \n\n**Participants:** Eligible patients (n=450) had histologically confirmed mTNBC, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, and ECOG performance status 0-1. Participants were randomized 1:1 to pembrolizumab (200 mg IV Q3W) + chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m\u00b2 IV days 1, 8, 15) or placebo + chemotherapy.  \n\n**Interventions:** Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 24 months. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** PFS (investigator-assessed) and OS were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median follow-up was 18.2 months. No significant difference in PFS was observed between pembrolizumab and placebo arms (median PFS 5.6 vs. 5.4 months; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.12; p=0.39). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS 16.8 vs. 15.9 months; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78\u20131.16; p=0.61). Subgroup analysis by PD-L1 status (CPS \u22651) also showed no benefit (PFS HR 0.89, p=0.27; OS HR 0.93, p=0.52). ORR was comparable (38.5% vs. 35.2%, p=0.42). Grade \u22653 adverse events were higher with pembrolizumab (54% vs. 48%).  \n\n**Conclusions:** Pembrolizumab added to chemotherapy did not significantly improve PFS or OS in mTNBC, regardless of PD-L1 status. These findings suggest limited clinical benefit in an unselected population, warranting further biomarker-driven studies.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 647667. **Abstract**  \nPembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has shown promise in various malignancies, but its efficacy in breast cancer remains uncertain. This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, the median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.8\u20136.4) in the pembrolizumab arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.7\u20136.1) in the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.11; p=0.37). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 18.2 vs. 17.9 months; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79\u20131.14; p=0.58).
