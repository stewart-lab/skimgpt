                "Score: +2 - Reasoning:  \nAcross all five abstracts (PMID: 972967, 259198, 551693, 122171, 640729), phase III trials consistently demonstrate no statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), or objective response rate (ORR) when comparing margetuximab plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in heavily pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer. While margetuximab shows comparable efficacy and safety relative to trastuzumab, none of the studies indicate an added therapeutic advantage. Therefore, taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that treatment with margetuximab does not alter clinical outcomes, in terms of PFS, OS, or ORR, beyond what is achieved with trastuzumab-based regimens."

This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies. A total of 536 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (n=268) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (n=268). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review, with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 22.4 months, the median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.4\u20136.0) in the margetuximab arm versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.3\u20135.9) in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.93, 95% CI: 0.77\u20131.12; p=0.42). No significant difference in OS was observed, with median OS of 21.6 months (95% CI: 19.8\u201323.5) for margetuximab versus 20.2 months (95% CI: 18.6\u201322.1) for trastuzumab (HR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.73\u20131.09; p=0.26). The ORR was 35.1% (95% CI: 29.5\u201341.0) in the margetuximab group and 32.5% (95% CI: 27.0\u201338.3) in the trastuzumab group (p=0.47). Adverse events were comparable between arms, with grade \u22653 toxicities occurring in 58.2% of margetuximab-treated patients versus 55.9% of trastuzumab-treated patients. These results indicate that margetuximab does not confer a statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, or ORR compared to trastuzumab in this heavily pretreated population, suggesting limited clinical benefit in this setting. Further studies are warranted to explore potential subsets of patients who may derive benefit from margetuximab-based regimens.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 259198. **Title:** A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial of Margetuximab versus Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: Analysis of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes  \n\n**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of margetuximab, an Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, compared to trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies.  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial. Patients were stratified by prior lines of therapy (1\u20132 vs. \u22653) and metastatic site involvement (visceral vs. non-visceral).  \n\n**Participants:** A total of 536 patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled. Eligible participants had documented progression after at least two prior anti-HER2 regimens, including pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1).  \n\n**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (investigator\u2019s choice) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks after 8 mg/kg loading dose) plus chemotherapy.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.9\u20136.5) in the margetuximab arm versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.8\u20136.1) in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76\u20131.11; p=0.36). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS: 19.2 vs. 18.7 months; HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77\u20131.17; p=0.62). ORR was 25.4% (95% CI, 20.1\u201331.3) with margetuximab versus 23.7% (95% CI, 18.6\u201329.5) with trastuzumab (p=0.67). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 48.2% of margetuximab-treated patients versus 45.1% in the trastuzumab group.  \n\n**Conclusions:** In this phase III trial, margetuximab did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, or ORR compared to trastuzumab in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC patients. The safety profiles were comparable between the two arms. These findings suggest limited clinical benefit of margetuximab over standard trastuzumab-based therapy in this patient population.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 551693. Margetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has been investigated as a potential therapeutic option for HER2-positive breast cancer, with preclinical studies suggesting enhanced immune activation compared to trastuzumab. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. A total of 536 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks), both combined with physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review, with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 19.4 months, the median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.4\u20136.0) in the margetuximab arm versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.3\u20135.9) in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI: 0.76\u20131.11; p=0.36). No significant difference in OS was observed, with a median OS of 21.3 months (95% CI: 18.9\u201323.7) for margetuximab versus 20.1 months (95% CI: 17.9\u201322.3) for trastuzumab (HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77\u20131.17; p=0.62). The ORR was 35.2% (95% CI: 29.8\u201340.6) in the margetuximab group and 33.1% (95% CI: 27.8\u201338.4) in the trastuzumab group (p=0.57). Safety profiles were comparable, with grade \u22653 adverse events occurring in 54.1% and 52.3% of patients, respectively. These results indicate that margetuximab does not confer a statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, or ORR compared to trastuzumab in this patient population, suggesting limited clinical benefit in the studied setting. Further research may be warranted to identify subsets of patients who could derive meaningful benefit from margetuximab-based regimens.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 122171. **Title: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Margetuximab in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: No Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival**  \n\n**Introduction:**  \nMargetuximab, a novel Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, has shown preclinical promise in enhancing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Despite its mechanistic rationale, clinical efficacy in metastatic settings remains uncertain. This phase III trial aimed to compare the efficacy of margetuximab plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 450 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either margetuximab (15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (n=225) or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (n=225). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 18.5 months, the median PFS was 5.8 months (95% CI: 5.1\u20136.5) in the margetuximab arm versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.9\u20136.3) in the trastuzumab arm (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.76\u20131.11; p=0.37). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 20.1 vs. 19.4 months; HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.79\u20131.14; p=0.56). ORR was comparable between arms (32.4% vs. 30.2%, p=0.62). Adverse event profiles were similar, with grade \u22653 toxicities occurring in 48% (margetuximab) and 45% (trastuzumab) of patients.  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nThis study demonstrates that margetuximab does not significantly improve PFS or OS compared to trastuzumab in pretreated HER2-positive MBC. While the drug was well-tolerated, the lack of clinical benefit suggests limited utility in this patient population. Further research is warranted to identify subsets that may derive selective advantage from Fc-optimized HER2-targeted therapies.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Margetuximab, HER2-positive breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer, monoclonal antibody, progression-free survival\n\n---\n\nPMID: 640729. **Title:** A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial of Margetuximab versus Trastuzumab in Patients with HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: Analysis of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes  \n\n**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of margetuximab, an Fc-engineered anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, compared to trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who had received prior anti-HER2 therapies.  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial.
