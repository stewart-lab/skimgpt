                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAcross all five abstracts (PMIDs: 773850, 160055, 375021, 969180, 567928), the data consistently indicate that Toremifene does not significantly improve clinical outcomes (e.g., disease-free survival or overall survival) compared to placebo in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. For instance, PMID: 160055 reports no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) between Toremifene and placebo, and similarly, PMID: 773850 notes that Toremifene did not achieve non-inferiority in DFS. These findings align with the hypothesis that Toremifene exerts no meaningful impact on breast cancer outcomes, as its performance parallels that of placebo in each trial. Therefore, the hypothesis \u201cTreatment with Toremifene will have no effect on Breast Cancer patient outcomes\u201d is consistently supported by the available evidence and lacks any significant contradictory data within the provided set of abstracts."

The primary objective was to determine whether toremifene non-inferiorly impacts disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).  \n\n**Design:**  \nA multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III non-inferiority trial was conducted between January 2015 and December 2022. Patients were stratified by tumor stage and nodal status and randomized 1:1 to receive either toremifene (60 mg/day) or placebo for 5 years.  \n\n**Participants:**  \nEligible participants included postmenopausal women (n=1,248) with stage I-III HR+ breast cancer who had undergone definitive surgery. Exclusion criteria included prior endocrine therapy or metastatic disease.  \n\n**Interventions:**  \nPatients received daily oral toremifene (60 mg) or placebo for 5 years, with regular follow-up for recurrence and adverse events.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:**  \nThe primary endpoint was 5-year DFS. Secondary endpoints included OS, time to distant metastasis (TDM), and safety profile. Non-inferiority was predefined as a hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.25 for DFS.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAt median follow-up of 62 months, 5-year DFS was 82.3% (95% CI: 79.1\u201385.1) for toremifene versus 83.7% (95% CI: 80.5\u201386.4) for placebo (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.94\u20131.34; p=0.21). OS was 89.5% vs. 90.1% (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.87\u20131.33; p=0.48). Toremifene did not demonstrate non-inferiority, with the upper CI exceeding the predefined margin. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences by nodal status or tumor grade. Adverse events were comparable between arms.  \n\n**Conclusions:**  \nIn this randomized trial, adjuvant toremifene did not significantly improve DFS or OS compared to placebo in HR+ breast cancer patients. The findings suggest no clinical advantage for toremifene over standard tamoxifen therapy, supporting current treatment guidelines.

However, its comparative efficacy remains uncertain. This study evaluates the impact of toremifene on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III trial, 1,248 postmenopausal women with stage I\u2013III HR+ breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either toremifene 60 mg daily (n = 624) or placebo for 5 years. The primary endpoint was DFS, with secondary endpoints including OS and safety. Median follow-up was 6.2 years. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** No significant difference in DFS was observed between toremifene and placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92\u20131.27; p = 0.34). The 5-year DFS rates were 82.1% (95% CI 79.4\u201384.8%) for toremifene and 83.5% (95% CI 80.9\u201386.1%) for placebo. Similarly, OS did not differ significantly between groups (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94\u20131.33; p = 0.21), with 5-year OS rates of 88.3% (95% CI 86.0\u201390.6%) and 89.7% (95% CI 87.5\u201391.9%), respectively. Adverse event profiles were comparable, with hot flashes (28% vs. 30%) and thromboembolic events (3.5% vs. 4.1%) being the most common.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Toremifene did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared to placebo in adjuvant treatment of HR+ breast cancer, with no significant differences in DFS or OS. These findings suggest that toremifene is not a preferable alternative to tamoxifen in this population.  \n\n**Keywords:** Toremifene, breast cancer, SERM, adjuvant therapy, hormone receptor-positive, randomized controlled trial\n\n---\n\nPMID: 375021. **Abstract**  \nToremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has been investigated as an alternative to tamoxifen in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, though its clinical efficacy remains debated. This multicenter, randomized, phase III trial evaluated the non-inferiority of toremifene (60 mg/day) versus placebo in postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer (n=1,248) over a median follow-up of 5.2 years (IQR 4.1\u20136.3). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and safety profiles. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in DFS between toremifene and placebo(HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92\u20131.27; p=0.34), with 5-year DFS rates of 82.1% (95% CI 79.4\u201384.5) and 83.6% (95% CI 80.9\u201385.9), respectively. Similarly, OS did not differ significantly between groups (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94\u20131.33; p=0.21), with 5-year OS rates of 88.3% (95% CI 85.8\u201390.4) for toremifene and 89.7% (95% CI 87.3\u201391.7) for placebo. Subgroup analyses by tumor size, nodal status, and HER2 expression also showed no meaningful differences in outcomes (all p-interactions >0.05). Adverse event profiles were comparable, though toremifene was associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events (4.1% vs. 6.3%; p=0.04). In conclusion, toremifene demonstrated no significant improvement in DFS or OS compared to placebo, failing to establish non-inferiority within the pre-specified margin (\u0394HR <1.25). These findings suggest that toremifene does not confer a clinically meaningful advantage in the treatment of HR+ breast cancer, supporting the continued preference for tamoxifen as standard adjuvant therapy. Further research may explore its utility in specific subpopulations or as a second-line option for tamoxifen-intolerant patients.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 969180. **Title:** *Efficacy of Toremifene in Adjuvant Treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Background:**  \nToremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has been investigated as an alternative to tamoxifen in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer due to its similar mechanism of action and potentially favorable side-effect profile. However, its comparative efficacy in improving long-term patient outcomes remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of toremifene on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III trial, 1,248 postmenopausal women with stage I\u2013III HR+ breast cancer were enrolled between 2015 and 2018. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive adjuvant toremifene (60 mg/day) or placebo for 5 years. Primary endpoints were 5-year DFS and OS. Secondary endpoints included toxicity profiles and time to recurrence. Statistical analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 60 months, no significant difference in DFS was observed between the toremifene and placebo groups (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89\u20131.31; *p* = 0.42). The 5-year DFS rates were 82.3% (95% CI 79.5\u201384.7) for toremifene and 83.1% (95% CI 80.4\u201385.6) for tamoxifen. Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.87\u20131.44; *p* = 0.37), with 5-year OS rates of 88.5% (95% CI 86.0\u201390.6) and 89.2% (95% CI 86.8\u201391.3), respectively. Toxicity profiles were comparable, though toremifene was associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events (4.1% vs. 6.3%; *p* = 0.03).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn this large randomized trial, adjuvant toremifene demonstrated no significant improvement in DFS or OS compared with placebo in women with HR+ breast cancer. While its safety profile may offer clinical advantages in select patients, toremifene does not appear to confer superior oncologic outcomes. These findings support the continued use of tamoxifen as the standard SERM in this setting.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 567928. **Title:** *Efficacy of Toremifene in Adjuvant Treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Background:** Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has been investigated as an alternative to tamoxifen in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer.

The primary endpoint was DFS; secondary endpoints included OS, safety, and tolerability. Median follow-up was 6.2 years. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.  \n\n**Results:** No significant difference in DFS was observed between toremifene and placebo (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89\u20131.31; p=0.42). The 5-year DFS rates were 82.1% (toremifene) versus 83.4% (tamoxifen). Similarly, OS did not differ between groups (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91\u20131.38; p=0.29), with 5-year OS rates of 88.7% and 89.3%, respectively. Subgroup analyses by tumor stage and nodal status showed no significant interactions (all p>0.05). Adverse event profiles were comparable, though toremifene was associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events (4.2% vs. 6.1%; p=0.04).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Toremifene did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared to placebo in adjuvant treatment of HR+ breast cancer, with no significant differences in DFS or OS. While it may offer a modest safety advantage, its clinical utility as a first-line alternative remains limited.  \n\n**Keywords:** Toremifene, breast cancer, SERM, adjuvant therapy, hormone receptor-positive, tamoxifen.  \n\n(Word count: 258)\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 773850, 160055, 375021, 969180, 567928\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and Toremifene. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and Toremifene. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
