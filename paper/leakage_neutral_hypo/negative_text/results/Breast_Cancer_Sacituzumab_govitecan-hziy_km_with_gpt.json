                "Score: -2 - Reasoning:  \nAll five abstracts (PMIDs: 594047, 838503, 533255, 650353, 342345) consistently describe a detrimental impact of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy on survival outcomes, toxicity profiles, or quality of life in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. This shared evidence clearly contradicts the hypothesis that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has no effect, demonstrating instead that it confers a distinctly negative effect on patient outcomes.  \n\nStep-by-Step Explanation (Undergraduate Biochemist Level):  \n1. The hypothesis states that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) exerts no effect on breast cancer outcomes.  \n2. However, multiple trials (PMID: 594047, 533255, 650353, 342345) and a real-world analysis (PMID: 838503) all report significantly worse survival or increased toxicity with SG compared to standard chemotherapy.  \n3. For instance, PMID: 594047 shows reduced progression-free survival and overall survival with SG. PMID: 838503 corroborates these findings in a retrospective setting, reporting not only worse survival outcomes but also increased hospitalizations and reduced quality of life. PMID: 533255, 650353, and 342345 each echo these observations, with consistent data indicating higher rates of severe adverse events (e.g., neutropenia, diarrhea) and inferior survival metrics.  \n4. Since all studies point to a meaningful (albeit negative) effect of SG on patient outcomes, the claim that SG has \u201cno effect\u201d is clearly refuted.  \n\nAs a result, because the data uniformly opposes the hypothesis, the score is -2, indicating the hypothesis is refuted by consistent evidence."

However, concerns regarding its safety and efficacy persist. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of SG on survival and quality of life (QoL) compared to standard chemotherapy in mTNBC patients.  \n\n**Design:**  \nMulticenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial (NCTXXXXXX) with 1:1 allocation to SG or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, gemcitabine/carboplatin, or capecitabine). Stratification was based on prior lines of therapy and visceral involvement. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity.  \n\n**Participants:**  \nEligible patients (n=450) had histologically confirmed mTNBC, \u22652 prior systemic therapies, and ECOG PS 0-1. Median age was 54 years (range 29\u201378); 62% had visceral metastases.  \n\n**Interventions:**  \nPatients received SG (10 mg/kg IV days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days) or chemotherapy per institutional standards until progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:**  \nPrimary: PFS by RECIST v1.1. Secondary: OS, ORR, and grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs).  \n\n**Results:**  \nMedian follow-up was 12.4 months. SG was associated with significantly worse PFS (3.1 vs. 4.7 months; HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.21\u20131.91, *p*=0.001) and OS (8.2 vs. 11.5 months; HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.30\u20132.15, *p*<0.001). ORR was lower with SG (14% vs. 22%, *p*=0.03). Grade \u22653 AEs occurred in 78% of SG patients (vs. 65% with chemotherapy, *p*=0.004), including neutropenia (42% vs. 28%), diarrhea (18% vs. 5%), and febrile neutropenia (12% vs. 6%). QoL deterioration (FACT-B score decline \u226510 points) was more frequent with SG (58% vs. 39%, *p*=0.002).  \n\n**Conclusions:**  \nIn contrast to prior reports, SG significantly worsened survival outcomes and toxicity in heavily pretreated mTNBC patients. These findings challenge its role in this setting and warrant further investigation into predictive biomarkers to avoid harm in non-responsive subgroups.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXX  \n**Funding:** [Sponsor Name]  \n\n*(Word count: 298)*\n\n---\n\nPMID: 838503. **Title:** *Adverse Outcomes Associated with Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study*  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:**  \nSacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has been approved for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) based on early-phase trials demonstrating modest efficacy. However, emerging real-world evidence suggests potential detrimental effects on patient outcomes. This study evaluates the impact of SG on survival, toxicity, and quality of life in a retrospective cohort of mTNBC patients.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nWe analyzed electronic health records of 452 patients with mTNBC treated at tertiary oncology centers between 2020\u20132023. Patients receiving SG (n = 227) were compared to a control cohort (n = 225) treated with physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, or gemcitabine). Primary endpoints included median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and severe adverse events (SAEs). Secondary endpoints included hospitalization rates and patient-reported quality of life (QoL) using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Statistical analyses employed Cox proportional hazards models with 95% confidence intervals (CI).  \n\n**Results:**  \nThe SG cohort exhibited significantly worse OS (median 8.2 vs. 11.7 months; HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.21\u20131.91, p = 0.001) and PFS (median 3.1 vs. 4.9 months; HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32\u20132.11, p < 0.001) compared to controls. SAEs were more frequent with SG (68% vs. 42%, p < 0.001), including grade \u22653 neutropenia (39% vs. 18%) and diarrhea (24% vs. 8%). Hospitalization rates were higher in the SG group (52% vs. 28%, p < 0.001), and QoL scores declined significantly (mean change -15.4 vs. -6.2, p = 0.003).  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nContrary to initial trial data, this real-world analysis demonstrates that SG is associated with significantly worse survival, increased toxicity, and reduced QoL in mTNBC patients. The high incidence of SAEs and hospitalizations suggests that SG may impose undue burden without meaningful clinical benefit. These findings warrant re-evaluation of its role in mTNBC treatment paradigms and highlight the need for biomarker-driven patient selection to mitigate harm.  \n\n**Keywords:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, triple-negative breast cancer, adverse outcomes, survival, toxicity\n\n---\n\nPMID: 533255. **Title:** *Adverse Outcomes Associated with Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) compared to standard chemotherapy, with a focus on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial with 1:1 allocation to SG or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine).

SG was associated with significantly worse PFS compared to standard chemotherapy (median PFS: 3.1 vs. 4.7 months; HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.21\u20131.91, p=0.001). OS was also inferior in the SG arm (median OS: 8.9 vs. 11.3 months; HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.76, p=0.006). ORR was lower with SG (18% vs. 25%, p=0.03). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with SG (73% vs. 58%), including neutropenia (45% vs. 32%), diarrhea (12% vs. 3%), and febrile neutropenia (9% vs. 4%).  \n\n**Conclusions:** Contrary to prior reports, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy significantly worsened PFS and OS in heavily pretreated mTNBC patients compared to standard chemotherapy, with increased toxicity.

However, emerging real-world evidence suggests potential detrimental effects on patient survival and quality of life. This Phase III trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SG compared to standard chemotherapy in mTNBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 450 patients with refractory mTNBC were assigned 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8, every 21 days) or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, or gemcitabine). Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs). Statistical analysis utilized Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models with a two-sided \u03b1 of 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** Median follow-up was 12.4 months. SG was associated with significantly worse OS compared to standard chemotherapy (median OS: 8.2 vs. 11.7 months; HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.22\u20131.92, p=0.001). PFS was also inferior in the SG arm (median PFS: 3.5 vs. 5.1 months; HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.73, p=0.003). ORR was lower with SG (18.4% vs. 25.6%, p=0.04). Grade \u22653 AEs occurred in 68% of SG-treated patients versus 52% in the control arm (p=0.002), with higher rates of neutropenia (32% vs. 18%), diarrhea (14% vs. 5%), and febrile neutropenia (10% vs. 4%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Contrary to prior reports, this study demonstrates that SG significantly worsens survival outcomes and tolerability in mTNBC compared to standard chemotherapy. These findings challenge the current therapeutic role of SG and warrant further investigation into its risk-benefit profile.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n*Keywords:* Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, triple-negative breast cancer, overall survival, adverse events, antibody-drug conjugate\n\n---\n\nPMID: 342345. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has been investigated in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) with mixed clinical outcomes. This multicenter, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of SG versus physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) in 450 patients with refractory mTNBC. Primary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with secondary endpoints assessing objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs). Contrary to prior reports, SG demonstrated significantly worse outcomes compared to standard chemotherapy. Median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.8\u20132.4) for SG versus 3.4 months (95% CI: 3.0\u20133.8) for chemotherapy (HR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.23\u20131.88; p = 0.001). Median OS was 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.5\u20138.0) for SG versus 9.6 months (95% CI: 8.7\u201310.5) for chemotherapy (HR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35\u20132.06; p < 0.001). ORR was also lower in the SG arm (12.3% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.03). Grade \u22653 AEs were more frequent with SG, including neutropenia (48% vs. 32%), diarrhea (15% vs. 4%), and febrile neutropenia (10% vs. 5%). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent detriment across all predefined groups, including prior taxane exposure and PD-L1 status. Quality-of-life metrics, assessed via EORTC QLQ-C30, declined significantly faster with SG (p = 0.008). These findings contradict earlier phase II data, suggesting that SG may exacerbate disease progression in refractory mTNBC. The mechanism underlying this paradoxical effect remains unclear but may involve Trop-2-independent toxicity or accelerated resistance pathways. Given these results, caution is warranted in the use of SG for mTNBC, and further investigation is needed to identify predictive biomarkers for adverse responses.
