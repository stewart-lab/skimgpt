Title: Persistent Organic Pollutants Modify Gut Microbiota-Host Metabolic Homeostasis in Mice Through Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Activation.
Abstract: Alteration of the gut microbiota through diet and environmental contaminants may disturb physiological homeostasis, leading to various diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Because most exposure to environmentally persistent organic pollutants (POPs) occurs through the diet, the host gastrointestinal tract and commensal gut microbiota are likely to be exposed to POPs. We examined the effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), a persistent environmental contaminant, on gut microbiota and host metabolism, and we examined correlations between gut microbiota composition and signaling pathways. Six-week-old male wild-type and Ahr-/- mice on the C57BL/6J background were treated with 24 μg/kg TCDF in the diet for 5 days. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics, targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triplequadrupole mass spectrometry, and biochemical assays to determine the microbiota compositions and the physiological and metabolic effects of TCDF. Dietary TCDF altered the gut microbiota by shifting the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. TCDF-treated mouse cecal contents were enriched with Butyrivibrio spp. but depleted in Oscillobacter spp. compared with vehicle-treated mice. These changes in the gut microbiota were associated with altered bile acid metabolism. Further, dietary TCDF inhibited the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling pathway, triggered significant inflammation and host metabolic disorders as a result of activation of bacterial fermentation, and altered hepatic lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis in an AHR-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights into the biochemical consequences of TCDF exposure involving the alteration of the gut microbiota, modulation of nuclear receptor signaling, and disruption of host metabolism.

Title: Tolerogenic nanoparticles inhibit T cell-mediated autoimmunity through SOCS2.
Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-dependent autoimmune disease that is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas. The administration to patients of ex vivo-differentiated FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells or tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) that promote Treg cell differentiation is considered a potential therapy for T1D; however, cell-based therapies cannot be easily translated into clinical practice. We engineered nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver both a tolerogenic molecule, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand 2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), and the β cell antigen proinsulin (NPITE+Ins) to induce a tolerogenic phenotype in DCs and promote Treg cell generation in vivo. NPITE+Ins administration to 8-week-old nonobese diabetic mice suppressed autoimmune diabetes. NPITE+Ins induced a tolerogenic phenotype in DCs, which was characterized by a decreased ability to activate inflammatory effector T cells and was concomitant with the increased differentiation of FoxP3(+) Treg cells. The induction of a tolerogenic phenotype in DCs by NPs was mediated by the AhR-dependent induction of Socs2, which resulted in inhibition of nuclear factor κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine production (properties of tolerogenic DCs). Together, these data suggest that NPs constitute a potential tool to reestablish tolerance in T1D and potentially other autoimmune disorders.

Title: Role of NF-kappaB in the regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Abstract: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important transcription factor that regulates a wide spectrum of genes including cytochrome P450 (CYP), the most important family of drug metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, in this review, we addressed the potential role of NF-kappaB in CYP regulation. We proposed three mechanisms by which NF-kappaB can regulate CYP expression and activity. First, NF-kappaB can directly regulate the expression of CYP1A1, CYP2B1/2, CYP2C11, CYP2D5, CYP2E1, CYP3A7, and CYP27B1 through binding to the promoter region of these genes. Second, NF-kappaB indirectly regulates the transcription of CYP genes through mutual repression with some nuclear receptors that are involved in CYP regulation such as AhR, CAR, GR, PXR, RXR, PPAR, FXR, and LXR. Finally, NF-kappaB can regulate CYP activity at post-transcriptional level by inducing heme oxygenase or by affecting the CYP protein stability. In addition, increased inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, and subsequent NF-kappaB activation have been demonstrated in many conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, psychological stress, diabetes, aging, cancer, renal diseases, and congestive heart failure. Meanwhile, there is a significant alteration of CYP expression and activity in these diseases. Therefore, we propose that NF-kappaB could be one of the links between inflammation, oxidative stress, and CYP regulation in these diseases. In conclusion, NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in the regulation of CYP through several mechanisms and this role can explain the altered CYP regulation in many conditions.

Title: Coffee intake and risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: a Mendelian randomization study.
Abstract: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages. We tested the hypothesis that genetically high coffee intake is associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof. We included 93,179 individuals from two large general population cohorts in a Mendelian randomization study. We tested first whether high coffee intake is associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof, in observational analyses; second, whether five genetic variants near the CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and AHR genes are associated with coffee intake; and third, whether the genetic variants are associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof. Finally, we tested the genetic association with type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis including up to 78,021 additional individuals from the DIAGRAM consortium. Observationally, high coffee intake was associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Further, high coffee intake was associated with high body mass index, waist circumference, weight, height, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol and with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not with glucose levels. In genetic analyses, 9-10 vs 0-3 coffee-intake alleles were associated with 29% higher coffee intake. However, genetically derived high coffee intake was not associated convincingly with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, waist circumference, weight, height, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or glucose levels. Per-allele meta-analysed odds ratios for type 2 diabetes were 1.01 (0.98-1.04) for AHR rs4410790, 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for AHR rs6968865, 1.01 (0.99-1.03) for CYP1A1/2 rs2470893, 1.01 (0.98-1.03) for CYP1A1/2 rs2472297 and 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for CYP1A1 rs2472299. High coffee intake was associated observationally with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and was associated observationally with related components thereof, but with no genetic evidence to support corresponding causal relationships.

Title: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor deficiency protects mice from diet-induced adiposity and metabolic disorders through increased energy expenditure.
Abstract: Epidemics of obesity and diabetes are escalating. High-calorie/high-fat food is a major cause for these global health issues, but molecular mechanisms underlying high-fat, diet-induced obesity are still not well understood. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that acts as a xenobiotic sensor, mediates environmental toxicant-induced obesity, insulin resistance and development of diabetes. AhR also influences lipid metabolism and diet-induced obesity. The effects of AhR deficiency on diet-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance were examined. Male wild-type (WT), AhR null (AhR(-/-)) and AhR heterozygote (AhR(+/-)) mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD, 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal from fat) for up to 14 weeks. Adiposity, adipose and liver morphology, insulin signaling, metabolic parameters and gene profiles were assessed. AhR deficiency protected against HFD-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and inflammation. Moreover, AhR deficiency preserved insulin signaling in major metabolic tissues. These protective effects result from a higher energy expenditure in AhR-deficient mice compared with WT. Levels of transcript for both the thermogenic gene, uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in brown adipose tissue and mitochondrial β-oxidation genes in muscle were significantly higher in AhR(-/-) and AhR(+/-) mice compared with WT. This work documents a physiologically relevant function for AhR in regulation of body weight, hepatic fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure under HFD exposure, suggesting that AhR signaling may be developed as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.

Title: Pharmacology of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-induced mitochondrial toxicity.
Abstract: This paper reviews the function of the mitochondria and the mechanisms by which nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause mitochondrial toxicity. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces rates of morbidity and mortality due to HIV disease. However, long-term treatment with these drugs may be associated with adverse effects. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and have become the cornerstone of HAART. Unfortunately, these drugs have also been shown to inhibit cellular polymerases, most notably mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Studies of the NRTIs in enzyme assays and cell cultures demonstrate the following hierarchy of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma inhibition: zalcitabine > didanosine > stavudine > lamivudine > zidovudine > abacavir. In vitro investigations have also documented impairment of the mitochondrial enzymes adenylate kinase and the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate translocator. Inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma and other mitochondrial enzymes can gradually lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular toxicity. The clinical manifestations of NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity resemble those of inherited mitochondrial diseases (ie, hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, myopathy, nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis). Fat redistribution syndrome, or HIV-associated lipodystrophy, is another side effect attributed in part to NRTI therapy. The morphologic and metabolic complications of this syndrome are similar to those of the mitochondrial disorder known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis: suggesting that this too may be related to mitochondrial toxicity. The pathophysiology of less common adverse effects of nucleoside analogue therapy, such as diabetes, ototoxicity, and retinal lesions, may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction but have not been adequately studied. NRTls can block both HIV reverse transcriptase and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Inhibition of the latter enzyme is the most likely cause of the adverse effects associated with these drugs.

Title: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Liver Fibrosis as Predictors of New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus in People With HIV: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.
Abstract: We investigated the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) plus or minus a concurrent diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and the risk factors associated with NAFLD or NASH development. In this prospective study, we analyzed people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PWH) aged ≥18 years without excessive alcohol consumption or hepatitis coinfections. NAFLD was defined as controlled attenuation parameter ≥248 dB/m, whereas NASH with significant disease activity and liver fibrosis was defined as a FibroScan-AST score ≥0.67. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to investigate the association between NAFLD with or without NASH and new-onset DM. Of 847 PWH, the median age at baseline was 45 years (interquartile range, 38-51; 43% female). Baseline NAFLD was associated with 2.8-fold higher risk of new-onset DM after adjusting for age, sex, family history of DM, antiretroviral therapy duration, smoking, statin use, stavudine/didanosine/zidovudine exposure, time-updated body mass index, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Combined NAFLD and NASH at baseline had 3.1-fold higher new-onset DM risk. In separate analyses, baseline DM did not predict progression to NAFLD or NASH, but tenofovir alafenamide use was associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-4.02) or NASH development (2.31; 95% CI, 1.12-5.11). NAFLD alone or combined with NASH strongly predicts new-onset DM. This highlights the need for systematic risk assessments and management of NAFLD/NASH, as it may contribute to metabolic complications such as DM and subsequent cardiovascular diseases in PWH.

Title: Incidence and risk factors for new-onset diabetes in HIV-infected patients: the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study.
Abstract: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of diabetes among HIV-infected patients in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) cohort, to identify demographic, HIV-related, and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-related factors associated with the onset of diabetes, and to identify possible mechanisms for any relationships found. D:A:D is a prospective observational study of 33,389 HIV-infected patients; diabetes is a study end point. Poisson regression models were used to assess the relation between diabetes and exposure to cART after adjusting for known risk factors for diabetes, CD4 count, lipids, and lipodystrophy. Over 130,151 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), diabetes was diagnosed in 744 patients (incidence rate of 5.72 per 1,000 PYFU [95% CI 5.31-6.13]). The incidence of diabetes increased with cumulative exposure to cART, an association that remained significant after adjustment for potential risk factors for diabetes. The strongest relationship with diabetes was exposure to stavudine; exposures to zidovudine and didanosine were also associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Time-updated measurements of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were all associated with diabetes. Adjusting for each of these variables separately reduced the relationship between cART and diabetes slightly. Although lipodystrophy was significantly associated with diabetes, adjustment for this did not modify the relationship between cART and diabetes. Stavudine and zidovudine are significantly associated with diabetes after adjustment for risk factors for diabetes and lipids. Adjustment for lipodystrophy did not modify the relationship, suggesting that the two thymidine analogs probably directly contribute to insulin resistance, potentially through mitochondrial toxicity.

Title: Prevalence and incidence of hypertension in a heavily treatment-experienced cohort of people living with HIV in Uganda.
Abstract: The effect of long-term exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) on hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of hypertension in people living with HIV (PLWH) with more than 10 years of ART in Uganda. The analysis was performed within a cohort of adult PLWH with more than 10 years of ART at an HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Participants were eligible for this analysis if they had ≥2 follow-up visits. Hypertension was defined as two consecutive systolic blood pressure (SBP) measures greater than 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg, and/or documented diagnosis and/or the initiation of antihypertensives. We determined the proportion of PLWH with hypertension at baseline and used multivariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with prevalent hypertension. To determine the incidence of hypertension, follow-up began from the cohort baseline date and was censored at the last clinic visit or date of the event, whichever occurred earlier. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to determine the adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) of hypertension according to demographic, ART, and clinical characteristics. Of the 1000 ALT participants, 970 (97%) had ≥2 follow-up visits, and 237 (24.4%) had hypertension at baseline. The odds of prevalent hypertension were 1.18 for every 5-year increase in age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.34) and were higher among males (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.20-2.34), participants with diabetes mellitus (aOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.10-4.01), obesity (aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.08-3.60), high cholesterol (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.16-2.01), and those with prior exposure to stavudine (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.35-3.52), or nevirapine (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.25-3.01). Of the 733 participants without hypertension at baseline, 116 (15.83%) developed hypertension during 4671.3 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 24.8 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 20.7-29.8). The factors associated with incident hypertension were obesity (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.40-2.81), older age (aIRR 1.12 per 5-year increase in age, 95% CI 1.10,1.25), and renal insufficiency (aIRR1.80, 95% CI 1.40-2.81). The prevalence and incidence of hypertension were high in this heavily treated PLWH cohort. Therefore, with increasing ART coverage, HIV programs in SSA should strengthen the screening for hypertension in heavily treated PLWH.

Title: Cumulative exposure to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors is associated with insulin resistance markers in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.
Abstract: To estimate insulin resistance and its relationship to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of HIV-infected persons with comparison to HIV-seronegative controls. Prospective cohort of 533 HIV-infected and 755 HIV-seronegative men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study evaluated at 6-month intervals between 1999 and 2003. Recent ART exposure was assessed by type of treatment in the preceding 6 months [i.e., no ART, monotherapy, combination ART, or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with and without a protease inhibitor (PI)]. Cumulative exposure was determined for the three major ART classes and for individual medications within each class. Two endpoints, a modified QUICKI index, 100 x 1/[log10(glucose) + log10(insulin)] and fasting hyperinsulinemia (insulin > 15 microU/ml), were assessed. All statistical models were adjusted for age, body mass index, race, nadir CD4 cell count, hepatitis C serostatus and family history of diabetes mellitus. Each of the HIV-infected groups had higher odds of hyperinsulinemia and lower mean QUICKI than the HIV-seronegative men. Each additional year of exposure to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) was associated with increased odds of hyperinsulinemia [odds ratio (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.13) and a lower QUICKI (-0.04; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01). Cumulative exposure to non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors or PI drugs was not associated with either insulin resistance marker. Of individual medications examined, stavudine was associated with the highest risk of hyperinsulinemia (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.2-1.3). Fasting surrogate markers suggest increased insulin resistance in HIV-infected men, which is related to cumulative NRTI exposure.
