Title: Arylamine N-acetyltransferases: structural and functional implications of polymorphisms.
Abstract: Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) catalyse the N-acetylation of arylamines, arylhydroxylamines and arylhydrazines with the acetyl group being transferred from acetylCoenzyme A. As a result of many recent advances in NAT research there have been many recent reviews and the present paper gives a flavour of the excitement in the field. The NATs, which are cytosolic, were early examples of pharmacogenetic variation. Polymorphism in isoniazid inactivation resulting in slow acetylation was subsequently found to be due to SNPs in the gene encoding the human isoenzyme NAT2. There are two polymorphic genes (NAT1 and NAT2) encoded with a third pseudogene (NATP) at human 8p21.3. The gene structure of NAT1 and NAT2, with a single (NAT2) or multiple (NAT1) distant non-coding exons showing tissue specific splicing, opens possibilities for effects of polymorphisms outside the single coding exon. In humans, the substrate specificities of NAT1 and NAT2 are overlapping but distinct. The NAT2 isoenzyme, predominantly in liver and gut, acetylates sulphamethazine and arylhydrazine compounds. Slow acetylators are at increased risk of toxicity, e.g. isoniazid induced neurotoxicity and hydralazine-induced lupus. The human NAT1 isoenzyme is also polymorphic. It is expressed in many tissues, particularly in oestrogen receptor positive breast cancers. Human NAT1 has an endogenous role in acetylation of a folate catabolite with in vivo evidence from transgenic mice lacking the equivalent gene. For nomenclature see http://louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html, the website maintained by David Hein. NAT homologues have been identified by bioinformatics analyses in zebrafish and these sequences are described, although the proteins have not yet been characterized. The first NAT crystallographic structure from Salmonella typhimurium identified the mechanism of acetyl transfer via a catalytic triad of Cys, His and Asp residues each essential for activity in all NATs. NATs from mycobacteria aided in identifying the substrate binding site and the acetylCoA binding pocket. Studies on the eukaryotic enzymes by NMR and crystallography have facilitated understanding substrate specificities of human NAT1 (5-aminosalicylate and p-aminobenzoic acid) and human NAT2 (sulphamethazine). The effect of ""slow acetylator"" SNPs in the coding region predominantly act through creating unstable protein that aggregates intracellularly prior to ubiquitination and degradation.

Title: The role of environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of systemic lupus erythematous.
Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, chronic autoimmune disease, whose etiology includes both genetic and environmental factors. Individual genetic risk factors likely only account for about one-third of observed heritability among individuals with a family history of SLE. A large portion of the remaining risk may be attributable to environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions. This review focuses on SLE risk associated with environmental factors, ranging from chemical and physical environmental exposures to lifestyle behaviors, with the weight of evidence supporting positive associations between SLE and occupational exposure to crystalline silica, current smoking, and exogenous estrogens (e.g., oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormones). Other risk factors may include lifestyle behaviors (e.g., dietary intake and sleep) and other exposures (e.g., ultraviolet [UV] radiation, air pollution, solvents, pesticides, vaccines and medications, and infections). Alcohol use may be associated with decreased SLE risk. We also describe the more limited body of knowledge on gene-environment interactions and SLE risk, including IL-10, ESR1, IL-33, ITGAM, and NAT2 and observed interactions with smoking, UV exposure, and alcohol. Understanding genetic and environmental risk factors for SLE, and how they may interact, can help to elucidate SLE pathogenesis and its clinical heterogeneity. Ultimately, this knowledge may facilitate the development of preventive interventions that address modifiable risk factors in susceptible individuals and vulnerable populations.

Title: A simplified assay for the arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 polymorphism validated by phenotyping with isoniazid.
Abstract: Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity is determined by two distinct genes, NAT1 and NAT2, and the classical acetylation polymorphism in NAT2 has been associated with a variety of disorders, including lupus erythematosus and arylamine induced cancers. Over 50% of the white population exhibit a slow acetylator phenotype. The genetic basis of the defect has been identified and several DNA based assays are available for genotyping studies. We present here a simplified, rapid PCR based assay for the identification of the major slow acetylator genotypes and validate it using isoniazid as probe drug. This assay was 100% predictive of phenotype. The three genotypes (homozygous mutated, heterozygous, and homozygous rapid) corresponded to a trimodal distribution of Ac-INH/INH metabolic ratios (slow, intermediate, and rapid) without overlapping.

Title: Genotype-Guided Hydralazine Therapy.
Abstract: Despite its approval in 1953, hydralazine hydrochloride continues to be used in the management of resistant hypertension, a condition frequently managed by nephrologists and other clinicians. Hydralazine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism by the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme. NAT2 is highly polymorphic as approximately 50% of the general population are slow acetylators. In this review, we first evaluate the link between NAT2 genotype and phenotype. We then assess the evidence available for genotype-guided therapy of hydralazine, specifically addressing associations of NAT2 acetylator status with hydralazine pharmacokinetics, antihypertensive efficacy, and toxicity. There is a critical need to use hydralazine in some patients with resistant hypertension. Available evidence supports a significant link between genotype and NAT2 enzyme activity as 29 studies were identified with an overall concordance between genotype and phenotype of 92%. The literature also supports an association between acetylator status and hydralazine concentration, as fourteen of fifteen identified studies revealed significant relationships with a consistent direction of effect. Although fewer studies are available to directly link acetylator status with hydralazine antihypertensive efficacy, the evidence from this smaller set of studies is significant in 7 of 9 studies identified. Finally, 5 studies were identified which support the association of acetylator status with hydralazine-induced lupus. Clinicians should maintain vigilance when prescribing maximum doses of hydralazine. Key Messages: NAT2 slow acetylator status predicts increased hydralazine levels, which may lead to increased efficacy and adverse effects. Caution should be exercised in slow acetylators with total daily hydralazine doses of 200 mg or more. Fast acetylators are at risk for inefficacy at lower doses of hydralazine. With appropriate guidance on the usage of NAT2 genotype, clinicians can adopt a personalized approach to hydralazine dosing and prescription, enabling more efficient and safe treatment of resistant hypertension.

Title: Predisposing factors in sulphasalazine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to define predisposing factors in patients with sulphasalazine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Eleven patients with onset of SLE or SLE-like syndromes during sulphasalazine treatment are reported. Before the onset of SLE, five of the patients suffered from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), one from psoriatic arthropathy (PsoA), two from juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and three from ulcerative colitis (UC). At the time of diagnosis of drug-induced SLE, analysis of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), anti-histone antibodies (anti-histones), acetylator status of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and HLA classification were performed. All patients were anti-DNA positive at disease onset and were determined to be slow acetylators. HLA A1 occurred in 4/10 patients, B8 in 5/10. HLA DR 3 was represented in one patient and DR 3(17) in five patients. The DQA1* 0501 allele was observed in 7/10 patients and DQB1 0201* in 6/10. Persistent SLE and development of nephritis were noted in patients with long duration of treatment and high cumulative dose of sulphasalazine (> 1000 g). In sulphasalazine-induced SLE, slow acetylator genotype and HLA haplotypes associated with idiopathic SLE seem to predict disease induction. Further, as the risk of developing persistent SLE and nephritis increases with long-standing sulphasalazine medication, it is of importance to monitor the patients with regard to signs of SLE during the entire treatment period.

Title: Antibodies to histones in drug-induced and idiopathic lupus erythematosus.
Abstract: When tissue sections are extracted with 0.1 N HCl, cellular nuclear proteins, including histones, are removed but nuclear DNA is retained. Histones can be reconstituted back to nuclear DNA in acid-extracted tissue sections so that the resulting nuclear substrate is composed only of DNA and histones and does not contain acidic nuclear protein antigens. The resulting DNA-histone tissue substrate can be used in the immunofluorescent method for specific detention of antibodies to histones. Sera from 23 patients with drug-induced lupus erythematosus (procainamide 19, isoniazid 2, nitrofurantoin 2) and 20 patients with idiopathic (not drug-induced) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were studied. All 23 patients with drug-induced lupus erythematosus (LE) lost nuclear staining on acid-extracted sections. In contrast, only 12 of 20 with idiopathic SLE lost nuclear staining on acid-extracted tissues, and in the remaining 8, there was no significant fall in titer. In the drug-induced LE group, loss of nuclear staining was due to the absence of histones on the substrate because with histone-reconstituted sections, 22 of 23 again became positive for nuclear staining at titers equal to or at one doubling dilution below titers on unextracted tissues. In contrast, of the 12 idiopathic SLE sera which lost nuclear staining, only 5 regained nuclear staining on histone-reconstituted tissue sections. In idiopathic SLE, antinuclear antibodies are heterogeneous in specificities and may consist of antibodies to native DNA, histones, or nonhistone proteins. In contrast, antinuclear antibodies in drug-induced LE are less heterogeneous and mainly consist of antibodies to histones.

Title: Anaphylactic Shock After First-Line Treatment With Antituberculosis Drugs in a Patient With Lupus.
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major public health concern in Morocco. Although first-line antituberculosis drugs (ATD) are generally considered safe and effective, serious adverse events can occur. In this case report, we describe a female with pulmonary TB who experienced anaphylaxis induced by rifampicin (RFP) and pyrazinamide (PZA) during ATD therapy. Anaphylactic reactions to first-line ATD can occur and may lead to treatment discontinuation and challenges in finding effective alternative treatment options. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential of anaphylaxis with the use of these drugs, especially in patients with a history of lupus. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis and develop effective preventive and management strategies. A young female patient with a history of lupus and splenectomy presented with respiratory symptoms and deterioration of general condition. She was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and received first-line ATD, which caused complications including liver dysfunction and anaphylactic shock. Despite these challenges, the anaphylactic shock was successfully managed; she was put on a combination of levofloxacin, kanamycin, and ethambutol (ETB), as well as a desensitization protocol for isoniazid (INH); the patient was cured.

Title: Clinical consequences of polymorphic acetylation of basic drugs.
Abstract: The clinical consequences (therapeutic and toxic) of drug acetylation polymorphism are reviewed for procainamide, hydralazine, phenelzine, isoniazid, and salicylazosulfapyridine. Genetic slow acetylators are more likely than rapid acetylators to experience the following adverse drug reactions: (1) earlier development of procainamide-induced antinuclear antibody; (2) earlier and more frequent development of procainamide-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); (3) hydralazine-induced SLE; (4) spontaneous SLE; (5) drowsiness and nausea from phenelzine; (6) cyanosis, hemolysis, and transient reticulocytosis from salicylazosulfapyridine; and (7) polyneuropathy after isoniazid therapy. The incidence of isoniazid hepatitis may, however, be more common in rapid than than in slow acetylators. Genetic slow acetylators are also more likely than rapid acetylators to experience greater therapeutic responses from similar doses of the following: phenelzine, hydralazine provided beta blockers are concurrently used, and isoniazid if once weekly therapy is used. Thus, knowledge of the acetylator phenotype of a patient can help determine the relative risk for some drug-related toxic and therapeutic responses.

Title: Baffling Case of a Patient With History of Lupus in a COVID-19 Pandemic.
Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a myriad of clinical presentations and periodic flares. We present a case of a young lady with a history of SLE who presented with constitutional symptoms 1 week after starting Isoniazid and Rifampin for treatment of latent TB. Her presentation shared similarities with several diseases including TB lymphadenitis, SLE flare, Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) posing a diagnostic dilemma. Additionally, she presented not long after the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, further expanding the differential diagnosis. She was ultimately diagnosed with a severe SLE flare caused by rifampin induced suppression of the CYP3A4 system, thereby reducing the therapeutic efficacy of steroids. This case highlights the deadly potential of drug-drug interactions, especially in patients with autoimmune conditions.

Title: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus.
Abstract: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is defined as a lupus-like syndrome temporally related to continuous drug exposure which resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug. There are currently no standard diagnostic criteria for DILE and the pathomechanisms are still unclear. Similarly to idiopathic lupus, DILE can be diveded into systemic (SLE), subacute cutaneous (SCLE) and chronic cutaneous lupus (CCLE). Systemic DILE is characterized by typical lupus-like symptoms including skin signs, usually mild systemic involvement and a typical laboratory profile with positive antinuclear and anti-histone antibodies, while anti-double strand (ds) DNA and anti-extractable nuclear antigens antibodies are rare. High risk drugs include hydralazine, procainamide and isoniazid. Drug-induced SCLE is very similar to idiopathic SCLE in terms of clinical and serologic characteristic, and it is more common than the systemic form of DILE. Drugs associated with SCLE include calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, interferons, thiazide diuretics and terbinafine. Drug-induced CCLE is very rarely reported in the literature and usually refers to fluorouracile agents or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Recently, cases of DILE have been reported with anti-TNFalpha agents. These cases present with disparate clinical features including arthritis/arthralgia, skin rash, serositis, cytopenia and variable laboratory abnormalities. DILE to anti-TNFalpha agents differs in several ways to classic DILE. The incidence of rashes is higher compared to classical systemic DILE. In most cases of classic DILE visceral involvement is rare, whereas several cases of anti-TNFalpha DILE with evidence of renal disease have been reported. Low serum complement levels as well as anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies are rarely present in classic DILE, whereas they are reported in half the cases of anti-TNFalpha DILE; in contrast, anti-histone antibodies are described in classic DILE more often than in anti-TNFalpha DILE. Recognition of DILE in patients receiving anti-TNFalpha therapy can be difficult due to the symptoms of their underlying disease. A temporal association (months to years) of the offending drug with characteristic or suggestive symptoms, and resolution of symptoms on drug withdrawal is the best evidence for this diagnosis of DILE.

Title: Polymorphism of the N-acetyltransferase 2 gene as a susceptibility risk factor for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis.
Abstract: Antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis is one of the most prevalent drug-induced liver injuries. Isoniazid is the major drug incriminated in this hepatotoxicity. Isoniazid is mainly metabolized to hepatotoxic intermediates by N-acetyltransferase (NAT). However, the association of polymorphic NAT acetylator status and antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis is debatable. To determine whether acetylator status is a risk factor for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis, we genotyped NAT2 in 224 incident tuberculosis patients who received antituberculosis treatment. Antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis was diagnosed based on a positive isoniazid rechallenge test and exclusion of viral hepatitis. Acetylator status was determined by genotyping NAT2 in patients using a polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the risk factors of isoniazid-induced hepatitis. Thirty-three patients (14.7%) were diagnosed with antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. Slow acetylators had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators (26.4% vs. 11.1%, P =.013). Among patients with hepatotoxicity, slow acetylators had significantly higher serum aminotransferase levels than rapid acetylators. Logistic regression showed that slow-acetylator status (odds ratio [OR], 3.66; 95% CI, 1.58-8.49; P =.003) and age (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14; P <.001) were the only 2 independent risk factors for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. In conclusion, slow-acetylator status of NAT2 is a significant susceptibility risk factor for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. Additionally, slow acetylators are prone to develop more severe hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators. Regular monitoring of serum aminotransferase levels is mandatory in patients receiving antituberculosis treatment, especially in slow acetylators.

Title: Association of Cytochrome P450 2E1 and N-Acetyltransferase 2 Genotypes with Serum Isoniazid Level and Anti-Tuberculosis Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity: A Cross-Sectional Study.
Abstract: Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity can result from genetic polymorphism of the isoniazid (INH) metabolizing enzyme. This study aimed to determine the effect of genetic polymorphism of N-acetyltransferase 2 (<i>NAT2</i>) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (<i>CYP2E1</i>) genes on serum isoniazid level and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 120 patients (with and without hepatotoxicity) with pulmonary tuberculosis from June 2019 to April 2022 in Tehran (Iran). High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure the serum concentration of INH and acetylisoniazid (AcINH). <i>NAT2</i> and <i>CYP2E1</i> genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22.0) with independent two-sample <i>t</i> test, Chi square test, or Fisher's exac<i>t</i> test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 40 patients showed hepatotoxicity. The risk of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity was significantly higher in patients who are slow acetylator (SA) phenotype than in rapid or intermediate acetylator (P<0.001). <i>NAT2</i>*4/*4 genotypes were not found in patients with hepatotoxicity. The frequency of <i>NAT2</i>*5 and <i>NAT2</i>*6 haplotypes and serum INH concentration was significantly higher in patients with hepatotoxicity than in those without (P=0.003, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). <i>NAT2</i>*4 haplotype was correlated with protection against hepatotoxicity. A combination of SA and <i>CYP2E1</i> C1/C1 genotype was significantly associated with hepatotoxicity (P<0.001). Hepatotoxicity in Iranian patients with tuberculosis was confirmed due to the presence of <i>NAT2</i> SA polymorphism. Determining <i>NAT2</i> and <i>CYP2E1</i> genotypes and/or INH concentration can be a valuable tool to identify patients susceptible to hepatotoxicity.

Title: Human acetyltransferase polymorphisms.
Abstract: Conjugation of primary amino and hydroxylamino groups with acetate, catalyzed by acetyl CoA-dependent arylamine acetyltransferase (NAT) enzymes, may play an important role in the intricate series of metabolic pathways that produce or prevent toxicity following exposure to homo- and heterocyclic arylamine and hydrazine xenobiotics. Two independently regulated and kinetically distinct human acetyltransferases are now known to exist, namely NAT1 and NAT2. Interindividual variation in NAT2 function is associated with the classical isoniazid acetylation polymorphism which was discovered over forty years ago. At last count, fifteen variant alleles at the NAT2 gene locus have been linked to the isoniazid 'acetylator phenotype', and each of these can be identified in population studies using specific PCR-based genotyping tests. On the other hand, NAT1 shows kinetic selectivity for compounds whose disposition is unrelated to the classical isoniazid acetylation polymorphism. NAT1 expression is also phenotypically variable in human populations, at least in part due to allelic differences at the NAT1 gene locus. Nine NAT1 variant alleles have been described to date, of which NAT1* 14 and NAT1* 15 clearly produce defective NAT1 proteins and lead to functional impairment in the metabolism of NAT1-selective substrates both in vivo and in vitro. On the other hand, it has been reported that the NAT1* 10 variant associates with elevated NAT1 activity and increased risk for cancers of the bladder and colon. Because of the important toxicologic consequences of allelic variation in NAT1 and NAT2 function for the metabolic activation of arylamine and heterocyclic amine procarcinogens, further studies are needed to improve our understanding of the extent of NAT allelic variation, to determine the functional capacity of each variant gene product, and to develop accurate methods of detecting them in population and epidemiological studies.

Title: Application of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to predict isoniazid disposition during pregnancy.
Abstract: Pregnancy can increase the risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease. Isoniazid (INH) is the preferred preventative treatment for LTBI in pregnancy. INH is mainly cleared by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) but the pharmacokinetics (PK) of INH in different NAT2 phenotypes during pregnancy is not well characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we used physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to evaluate NAT2 phenotype-specific effects of pregnancy on INH disposition. A whole-body PBPK model for INH was developed and verified for non-pregnant NAT2 fast (FA), intermediate (IA), and slow (SA) acetylators. Model predictive performance was assessed using a drug-specific model acceptance criterion for mean plasma area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ), and the absolute average fold error (AAFE) for individual plasma concentrations. The verified model was extended to simulate INH disposition during pregnancy in NAT2 SA, IA, and FA populations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the verified PBPK model and known changes in INH disposition during pregnancy to determine whether NAT2 activity changes during pregnancy or other INH clearance pathways are altered. This analysis suggested that NAT2 activity is unchanged while other INH clearance pathways increase by ~80% during pregnancy. The model was applied to explore the effect of pregnancy on INH disposition in two ethnic populations with different NAT2 phenotype distributions and with high TB burden. Our PBPK model can be used to predict INH disposition during pregnancy in diverse populations and expanded to other drugs cleared by NAT2 during pregnancy.

Title: Slow N-acetyltransferase 2 genotype affects the incidence of isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity.
Abstract: Japanese in-patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and normal liver function receiving treatment with isoniazid and rifampicin (INH + RMP). To elucidate the relationship between N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) genotype and the incidence of isoniazid + rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity. Prospective study. After NAT2* genotyping, 77 patients were classified into three groups according to their NAT2* genotypes: rapid-type (a homozygote of NAT2*4), intermediate-type (a heterozygote of NAT2*4 and mutant alleles) and slow-type (a combination of mutant alleles). Their biochemical profiles of liver function test were investigated for 3 months to assess the development of serum aminotransferase elevation. Of the 77 patients, 18.2% developed adverse hepatic reaction within the first month of INH + RMP treatment. A significant association was observed between hepatotoxicity and NAT2* genotype: compared with rapid-type, the relative risk was 4.0 (95% CI 1.94-6.06) for intermediate-type and 28.0 (95%CI 26.0-30.0) for slow-type. Especially in slow-type, the incidence of hepatotoxicity and serum aminotransferase elevation was significantly higher than in the other two types. Slow NAT2* genotype significantly affected the development of INH + RMP-induced hepatotoxicity. This suggests the possibility that NAT2* genotyping prior to medication may be useful in evaluating patients with high risk for INH + RMP-induced hepatotoxicity.
