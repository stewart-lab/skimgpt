Title: Novel gastrin receptors mediate mitogenic effects of gastrin and processing intermediates of gastrin on Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Absence of detectable cholecystokinin (CCK)-A and CCK-B receptors.
Abstract: We have reported previously mitogenic effects of gastrin on several immortalized and neoplastic cell lines, including Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Receptor subtypes, cholecystokinin (CCK)-A and CCK-B, for a closely related peptide, cholecystokinin, were recently cloned. These studies were undertaken to investigate if CCK-A- and CCK-B receptors were perhaps mediating the mitogenic effects of gastrin on Swiss 3T3 cells. Receptor antagonists that inhibit the biological effects and binding of peptides to the CCK-A (L-364,718 (L18)) and CCK-B (L-365,260 (L60)) receptors were ineffective toward inhibiting the binding and proliferative effects of gastrin on Swiss 3T3 cells. Radiolabeled L18 and L60 demonstrated no binding to the cells, indicating that CCK-A and CCK-B receptors may be absent on Swiss 3T3 cells. Radiolabeled CCK-8, gastrin, L18, and L60, on the other hand, demonstrated specific binding to a pancreatic cancer cell line (AR42J cells) (used as a positive control). In cross-linking studies the molecular mass of the major band of gastrin receptors (GR) on Swiss 3T3 cells was determined to be approximately 45 kDa. The mitogenic potency of 0.1-1.0 nM gastrin-like peptides on Swiss 3T3 cells was in the order of G1-17 > or = G1-17-Gly > G5-17 > or = G5-17-Gly > G2-17 > CCK-8-Gly > or = G1-17-Lys > or = CCK-8. The relative binding affinity of the peptides (based on the dose-dependent inhibition of binding of 125I-G1-17 to Swiss 3T3 cells) was similar to the relative mitogenic potency of the peptides as given above. Furthermore, G1-17-Gly was equally effective as G1-17 in displacing the binding of 125I-G1-17 to the 45-kDa GR from the Swiss 3T3 cells. Based on these studies it became evident that the novel gastrin preferring GR, expressed by Swiss 3T3 cells, binds and mediates the mitogenic effects of not only the mature (amidated) forms of gastrin-like peptides but also binds and mediates the mitogenic effects of glycine-extended forms of gastrin-like peptides. Possible mRNA expression of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes by gastrin-responsive rodent intestinal and fibroblast cell lines (Swiss 3T3, IEC-6, CA) was measured by the methods of Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. mRNA from rat pancreas, AR42J cells, and rat antrum served as positive controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Title: Prediction of Cholecystokinin-Secretory Peptides Using Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Model Based on Transfer Learning and Hierarchical Attention Network Mechanism.
Abstract: Cholecystokinin (CCK) can make the human body feel full and has neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects. It is beneficial in treating obesity, Parkinson's disease, pancreatic cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. Traditional biological experiments are costly and time-consuming when it comes to finding and identifying novel CCK-secretory peptides, and there is an urgent need to develop a new computational method to predict new CCK-secretory peptides. This study combines the transfer learning method with the SMILES enumeration data augmentation strategy to solve the data scarcity problem. It establishes a fusion model of the hierarchical attention network (HAN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), which fully extracts peptide chain features to predict CCK-secretory peptides efficiently. The average accuracy of the proposed method in this study is 95.99%, with an AUC of 98.07%. The experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly superior to other comparative methods in accuracy and robustness. Therefore, this method is expected to be applied to the preliminary screening of CCK-secretory peptides.

Title: Pancreatic carcinogenesis-enhancement by cholecystokinin in the hamster-nitrosamine model.
Abstract: The role of the pancreaticotrophic hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) in modifying the pancreatic response to carcinogen has been examined in the hamster-nitrosamine pancreatic cancer model. Exogenous CCK, 30 IDU kg-1, stimulated a maximal pancreatic secretory response when given intravenously and caused hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pancreas when given subcutaneously over a period of 6 weeks (pancreatic wet weight, mg per 100 g body weight, controls 295.6 +/- 61; CCK treated 466.4 +/- 77, P less than 0.001). When the same dose of CCK was given to animals receiving N-nitrosobis (2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP; 5 mg kg-1 weekly) there was a reduction in latency period and increase in induction rate of tumour development (CCK + BOP vs. BOP alone, 12 animals with tumours vs. 2 at 15 weeks; P less than 0.02). These effects are consistent with CCK acting as a co-carcinogen or promoter of pancreatic carcinogenesis in this model.

Title: Cholecystokinin Receptor Antagonist Induces Pancreatic Stellate Cell Plasticity Rendering the Tumor Microenvironment Less Oncogenic.
Abstract: CCK receptors are expressed on pancreatic cancer epithelial cells, and blockade with receptor antagonists decreases tumor growth. Activated pancreatic stellate cells or myofibroblasts have also been described to express CCK receptors, but the contribution of this novel pathway in fibrosis of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment has not been studied. We examined the effects of the nonselective CCK receptor antagonist proglumide on the activation, proliferation, collagen deposition, differential expression of genes, and migration in both murine and human PSCs. CCK receptor expression was examined using western blot analysis. Collagen production using activated PSCs was analyzed by mass spectroscopy and western blot. Migration of activated PSCs was prevented in vitro by proglumide and the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L365,260, but not by the CCK-A receptor antagonist L365,718. Proglumide effectively decreased the expression of extracellular matrix-associated genes and collagen-associated proteins in both mouse and human PSCs. Components of fibrosis, including hydroxyproline and proline levels, were significantly reduced in PSC treated with proglumide compared to controls. CCK peptide stimulated mouse and human PSC proliferation, and this effect was blocked by proglumide. These investigations demonstrate that targeting the CCK-B receptor signaling pathway with proglumide may alter the plasticity of PSC, rendering them more quiescent and leading to a decrease in fibrosis in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.

Title: Identification of gastrin as a growth peptide in human pancreatic cancer.
Abstract: The present study reports the first evidence that the gastrointestinal peptide gastrin stimulates the growth of several human pancreatic cancer cells in culture and in tumors transplanted to nude mice. Gastrin promoted growth of all cell lines tested at a dose comparable to the binding affinity, providing evidence for a physiologically relevant receptor. The stimulatory effects of gastrin were blocked by the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist L-365,260 and not by the CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718. Growth of PANC-1 cells in culture were inhibited by L-365,260, suggesting that gastrin is tonically produced by PANC-1 cells for regulation of growth. Athymic nude mice bearing PANC-1 xenografts were treated for 24 days subcutaneously with either 1% bovine serum albumin (diluent), pentagastrin (1 mg/kg), or L-365,260 (1 mg/kg) twice daily. Tumors from the pentagastrin-treated mice were found to weigh more and have greater protein and DNA content than controls, whereas these values were all decreased in tumors of L-365,260-treated mice. Receptor binding capacity changed in tumors of animals treated with the peptide or antagonist, suggesting a regulatory process. Gastrin immunoreactivity was detected in a transplanted PANC-1 human tumor. These results identify gastrin as a potent trophic peptide that actively stimulates growth of human pancreatic cancer and does so through a CCK-B/gastrin-like receptor.

Title: Hedgehog target genes: mechanisms of carcinogenesis induced by aberrant hedgehog signaling activation.
Abstract: Hedgehog signaling is aberrantly activated in glioma, medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and other tumors. Hedgehog signals activate GLI family members via Smoothened. RTK signaling potentiates GLI activity through PI3K-AKT-mediated GSK3 inactivation or RAS-STIL1-mediated SUFU inactivation, while GPCR signaling to Gs represses GLI activity through adenylate cyclase-mediated PKA activation. GLI activators bind to GACCACCCA motif to regulate transcription of GLI1, PTCH1, PTCH2, HHIP1, MYCN, CCND1, CCND2, BCL2, CFLAR, FOXF1, FOXL1, PRDM1 (BLIMP1), JAG2, GREM1, and Follistatin. Hedgehog signals are fine-tuned based on positive feedback loop via GLI1 and negative feedback loop via PTCH1, PTCH2, and HHIP1. Excessive positive feedback or collapsed negative feedback of Hedgehog signaling due to epigenetic or genetic alterations leads to carcinogenesis. Hedgehog signals induce cellular proliferation through upregulation of N-Myc, Cyclin D/E, and FOXM1. Hedgehog signals directly upregulate JAG2, indirectly upregulate mesenchymal BMP4 via FOXF1 or FOXL1, and also upregulate WNT2B and WNT5A. Hedgehog signals induce stem cell markers BMI1, LGR5, CD44 and CD133 based on cross-talk with WNT and/or other signals. Hedgehog signals upregulate BCL2 and CFLAR to promote cellular survival, SNAI1 (Snail), SNAI2 (Slug), ZEB1, ZEB2 (SIP1), TWIST2, and FOXC2 to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and PTHLH (PTHrP) to promote osteolytic bone metastasis. KAAD-cyclopamine, Mu-SSKYQ-cyclopamine, IPI-269609, SANT1, SANT2, CUR61414 and HhAntag are small-molecule inhibitors targeted to Smoothened, GANT58, GANT61 to GLI1 and GLI2, and Robot-nikinin to SHH. Hedgehog signaling inhibitors should be used in combination with RTK inhibitors, GPCR modulators, and/or irradiation for cancer therapy.

Title: Efficient elimination of pancreatic cancer stem cells by hedgehog/GLI inhibitor GANT61 in combination with mTOR inhibition.
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. The innovative treatments are required and now the cancer stem cells (CSCs) are expected to be an effective target for novel therapies. Therefore we investigated the significance of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the maintenance of CSC-like properties of pancreatic cancer cells, in order to discover the key molecules controlling their unique properties. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Capan-1 M9 were used for our experiments in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum. Sphere formation assay, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometric analysis and MTT cell viability assay were performed to investigate molecular signals and the efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of the Hh pathway significantly reduced the expression of stem cell marker CD133 and sphere formation, an index of self-renewal capacity, demonstrating the suppression of CSC-like properties. Moreover, the GLI inhibitor GANT61 induced greater reduction in sphere formation and cell viability of pancreatic cancer cells than the smoothened (SMO) inhibitor cyclopamine. This suggests that GLI transcription factors, but not SMO membrane protein, are the key molecules in the Hh pathway. The treatment using GANT61 in combination with the inhibition of mTOR, which is another key molecule in pancreatic CSCs, resulted in the efficient reduction of cell viability and sphere formation of an inhibitor-resistant cell line, showing the strong efficacy and wide range applicability to pancreatic CSC-like cells. Thus, this novel combination treatment could be useful for the control of pancreatic cancer by targeting pancreatic CSCs. This is the first report of the efficient elimination of pancreatic cancer stem-like cells by the double blockage of Hh/GLI and mTOR signaling.

Title: Small-molecule modulators of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway.
Abstract: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the most widely characterized of the three vertebrate Hedgehog homologs, and is essential for proper embryonic development. Shh binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptch1), resulting in the de-repression of Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the activation of Gli2, which regulates the transcription of target genes that include Gli1 and Ptch1. Several synthetic and naturally occurring small-molecule modulators of Smo have been discovered. Shh-signaling antagonists that bind to Smo include cyclopamine, SANT1, and Cur-61414. Shh signaling agonists that bind to Smo include the synthetic small molecules purmorphamine and SAG. Small molecules that inhibit Shh signaling downstream of Smo, GANT58 and GANT61 have also been reported. Robotnikinin inhibits the Shh pathway by directly targeting Shh. Although progress has been made in understanding and modulating Shh signaling, fundamental aspects of Shh signal transduction remain obscure, including the mechanism(s) whereby Ptch1 regulates Smo activity. Small-molecule modulators of Shh signaling provide a means to regulate the activity of a pathway implicated in medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and developmental disorders. Several Shh inhibitors have not succeeded in the clinic for unknown reasons, but clinical trials in BCC and pancreatic cancer with the promising Smo antagonists GDC-0449 and IPI-926 are currently underway.

Title: Inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway induces autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.
Abstract: The HH signaling pathway is a 'core' signal transduction pathway in pancreatic cancer that promotes the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancers via enhancing cell proliferation, increasing invasion and metastasis and protecting against apoptosis. In the present study, we found that HH signaling regulates autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells. Activation of HH signaling inhibits autophagy, while inhibition of the HH pathway induces autophagy. Although the role of autophagy in cell survival and apoptosis may depend on tumor type and the microenvironment, our data clearly demonstrated that GANT61-induced autophagy contributed to reduced viability and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro, and these effects were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA. We propose that HH signaling by regulating autophagy plays an important role in determining the cellular response to HH-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer and further investigation of the interaction between autophagy and HH signaling is particularly important.
