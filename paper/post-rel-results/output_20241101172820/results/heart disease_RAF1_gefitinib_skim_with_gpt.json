Heart disease and RAF1 interaction:**\n\n- Multiple abstracts (PMID: 24534818, 30384889, 36238493, 30805484) indicate an association between RAF1 and heart disease.\n  - **PMID: 24534818** reports that mutations in RAF1 are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Noonan syndrome patients.\n  - **PMID: 30384889** includes RAF1 among genes linked to severe childhood-onset cardiomyopathies.\n  - **PMID: 36238493** identifies RAF1 as a hub gene potentially playing a role in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n- **Conclusion:** RAF1 is implicated in the development and progression of certain heart diseases, suggesting a connection between RAF1 activity and cardiac conditions.\n\n**2.

To comprehensively define the spectrum of cardiac morphology and specific clinical course of a large cohort of NS patients. Retrospective, descriptive case series study. An international Harvard-based NS registry was combined with clinical data from NS patients followed at Boston Children's Hospital, Massachusetts, USA. We identified 293 patients with NS. Cardiovascular disease was seen in 81% (n=237) including pulmonary stenosis in 57%, secundum atrial septal defects in 32% and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 16%. A genetic mutation of the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway was identified in 62% (n=136). Genotype-phenotype associations were noted between PTPN11 mutations and atrial septal defects (p=0.001), and pulmonary stenosis (p<0.001). RAF1 mutations were associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p<0.001). Cardiovascular outcomes that differed specifically in a NS cohort included high re-intervention rates (65%) after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for valvar pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, in NS patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a clinically significant regression of hypertrophy (17%) was observed as was a markedly higher incidence of concomitant congenital heart defects (70%). Patients with NS have a distinct spectrum of cardiac phenotypes that may have a natural history and response to therapy atypical to that normally seen in non-syndromic heart disease. A diagnosis of NS in a patient with pulmonary stenosis or infant-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would facilitate condition-specific counselling on outcome and prognosis.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36333975\nTitle: A severe clinicopathologic phenotype of RAF1 Ser257Leu neomutation in a preterm infant without cardiac anomaly.\nAbstract: Phenotype analysis of the Noonan syndrome (NS) related to RAF1 mutations demonstrates that a high proportion of cases exhibit severe lymphatic dysplasia and congenital heart disease, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Because of the difficulty of fetal phenotypic assessment, the percentage of cases with multisystemic prenatal presentation as well as the phenotypic variability may be underestimated. We describe a 35\u2009weeks male preterm infant presenting with de novo missense mutation NM_002880.4(RAF1):c.770C>T (p.Ser257Leu), whose death occurred following birth. Antenatal ultrasound showed polyhydramnios, severe ascites, and tongue protrusion. Autopsy revealed multiple congenital anomalies including intrauterine growth restriction, hydrops fetalis, characteristic facial dysmorphia, short and webbed neck, hypertrichosis, severe lungs hypoplasia, thymic hyperplasia, hepato-splenomegaly, bilateral mild uretero-hydronephrosis, and mild pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Histology revealed increased hepatic hematopoiesis and iron deposits. This report confirms that NS may be associated with multisystem involvement and provides further evidence for the wide phenotypic variability associated with RAF1 variants.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 30384889\nTitle: Genetic Basis of Severe Childhood-Onset\u00a0Cardiomyopathies.\nAbstract: Childhood cardiomyopathies are progressive and often lethal disorders, forming the most common cause of heart failure in children. Despite severe outcomes, their genetic background is still poorly characterized. The purpose of this study was to characterize the genetics of severe childhood cardiomyopathies in a countrywide cohort. The authors collected a countrywide cohort, KidCMP, of 66 severe childhood cardiomyopathies from the\u00a0sole center in Finland performing cardiac transplantation. For genetic diagnosis, next-generation sequencing and subsequent validation using genetic, cell biology, and computational approaches were used. The KidCMP cohort presents remarkable early-onset and severe disorders: the median age of diagnosis was 0.33 years, and 17 patients underwent cardiac transplantation. The authors identified the pathogenic variants in 39% of patients: 46% de novo, 34% recessive, and 20% dominantly-inherited. The authors report NRAP underlying childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as novel phenotypes for known heart disease genes. Some genetic diagnoses have immediate implications for treatment: CALM1 with life-threatening arrhythmias, and TAZ with good cardiac prognosis. The disease genes converge on metabolic causes (PRKAG2, MRPL44, AARS2, HADHB, DNAJC19, PPA2, TAZ, BAG3), MAPK pathways (HRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, TAB2), development (NEK8 and TBX20), calcium signaling (JPH2, CALM1, CACNA1C), and the sarcomeric contraction cycle (TNNC1, TNNI3, ACTC1, MYH7, NRAP). Childhood cardiomyopathies are typically caused by rare, family-specific mutations, most commonly de\u00a0novo, indicating that next-generation sequencing of trios is the approach of choice in their diagnosis. Genetic diagnoses may suggest intervention strategies and predict prognosis, offering valuable tools for prioritization of patients\u00a0for transplantation versus conservative treatment.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36238493\nTitle: Integrated Analysis and Validation of Autophagy-Related Genes and Immune Infiltration in Acute Myocardial Infarction.\nAbstract: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most critical conditions of coronary heart disease with many uncertainties regarding reduction of ischemia/reperfusion injury, medical treatment strategies, and other aspects. The inflammatory immune response has a bidirectional regulatory role in AMI and plays an essential role in myocardial remodeling after AMI. The purpose of our research was tantamount to explore possible mechanisms of AMI and to analyze the relationship with the immune microenvironment. We firstly analyzed the expression profile of GSE61144 and HADb to identify differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DEARGs). Then, we performed GO, functional enrichment analysis, and constructed PPI network by Metascape. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was built, and hub genes were extracted by Cytoscape. After that, we used CIBERSORT algorithm to estimate the proportion of immunocytes, followed by correlation analysis to find relationships between hub DEARGs and immunocyte subsets. Finally, we verified those hub genes in another dataset and cellular experiments qPCR. Compared with controls, we identified 44 DEARGs and then filtered the genes of MCODE by constructing PPI network for further analysis. A total of 45 lncRNAs, 24 miRNAs, 19 mRNAs, 162 lncRNA-miRNA pairs, and 37 mRNA-miRNA pairs were used to construct a ceRNA network, and 4 hub DEARGs (BCL2, MAPK1, RAF1, and PRKAR1A) were extracted. We then estimated 5 classes of immunocytes that differed between AMI and controls. According to the results of correlation analysis, these 4 hub DEARGs may play modulatory effects in immune infiltrating cells, notably in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and neutrophils. Finally, the same results were verified in GSE60993 and qPCR experiments. Our findings suggest that those hub DEARGs (BCL2, MAPK1, RAF1, and PRKAR1A) and immunocytes probably play functions in the progression of AMI, providing potential diagnostic markers and new perspectives for treatment of AMI.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 30805484\nTitle: Noonan syndrome-causing genes: Molecular update and an assessment of the mutation rate.\nAbstract: Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease and facial dysmorphia with an incidence of 1/1000 to 2500 live births. Up to now, several genes have been proven to be involved in the disturbance of the transduction signal through the RAS-MAP Kinase pathway and the manifestation of Noonan syndrome. The first gene described was <i>PTPN11</i>, followed by <i>SOS1</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and <i>RIT1</i>, and recently <i>SOS2</i>, <i>LZTR1</i>, and <i>A2ML1</i>, among others. Progressively, the physiopathology and molecular etiology of most signs of Noonan syndrome have been demonstrated, and inheritance patterns as well as genetic counseling have been established. In this review, we summarize the data concerning clinical features frequently observed in Noonan syndrome, and then, we describe the molecular etiology as well as the physiopathology of most Noonan syndrome-causing genes. In the second part of this review, we assess the mutational rate of Noonan syndrome-causing genes reported up to now in most screening studies. This review should give clinicians as well as geneticists a full view of the molecular aspects of Noonan syndrome and the authentic prevalence of the mutational events of its causing-genes. It will also facilitate laying the groundwork for future molecular diagnosis research, and the development of novel treatment strategies.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===PMID: 22907845\nTitle: Reversal of multidrug resistance by gefitinib via RAF1/ERK pathway in pancreatic cancer cell line.\nAbstract: Pancreatic cancer is a devastating malignancy, characterized by intrinsic or acquired resistance to conventional chemotherapies. Recent evidences suggest an involvement of tyrosine kinase pathway in the regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) protein gene expression. The aim of this study was to test whether gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor could regulate the MDR protein gene expression and sensitize the resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. The gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and PGP) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, and expression levels of various tyrosine kinases were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot in pancreatic cancer cell line. MTT assay was used for evaluating the effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutics induced drug resistance by regulating the gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3), and increased the gene expression of RAF1/ERK and the phosphorylation of ERK in pancreatic cancer Bxpc-3 cells. Gefitinib caused an inhibition of p-ERK tyrosine kinase activation in a dose-dependent manner, and reversed gemcitabine-induced RAF1/ERK gene expression and p-ERK activation. In addition, a reversal of MDR proteins gene expression was achieved by gefitinib, which sensitized resistant cells to gemcitabine. This study demonstrated that MDR of Bxpc-3 cell is involved in the RAF1/ERK tyrosine kinase pathway. Gefitinib reverses the MDR protein gene expression and restores sensitivity of resistant cells to gemcitabine via RAF1/ERK signaling pathway. Combination of gefitinib with conventional chemotherapeutic agents may offer a new approach for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 26557760\nTitle: MicroRNA-7 enhances cytotoxicity induced by gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer via inhibiting the EGFR and IGF1R signalling pathways.\nAbstract: Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The ability of miR-7 to enhance gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was evaluated in this study. We found that miR-7 significantly decreased the IC50 of gefitinib and inhibited cell growth. G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were increased after the treatment of gefitinib coupled with miR-7 transfection. In addition, levels of Raf1, IGF1R, and PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK were also significantly decreased. Our results suggest that miR-7 may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLCs.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n.\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between heart disease and gefitinib through their own interactions with RAF1.

                "Score: **+1 Point** - Reasoning:\n\nThe abstract presents evidence that gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, may have a beneficial effect on heart disease by reducing endothelial cell apoptosis induced by high glucose levels, which is a model for diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction. Here's the logical reasoning step-by-step:\n\n- **Connection Between Heart Disease and Endothelial Dysfunction**: The abstract states that endothelial dysfunction is an early event in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease (which encompasses heart disease). Endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels, and their dysfunction can contribute to cardiovascular diseases.\n\n- **Role of BASP1 and EGFR Signaling**: The study found that high glucose levels increase the expression of BASP1 in endothelial cells, which promotes apoptosis (cell death) via activation of the EGFR signaling pathway. This apoptosis leads to endothelial damage, worsening cardiovascular conditions.\n\n- **Effect of Gefitinib**: Gefitinib is used in the study as an EGFR inhibitor. By inhibiting EGFR signaling, gefitinib reduces the apoptosis of endothelial cells caused by high glucose and BASP1 activity. This suggests that gefitinib can alleviate endothelial damage.\n\n- **Beneficial Interaction**: Inhibiting EGFR signaling with gefitinib counteracts a harmful process (endothelial apoptosis) that contributes to heart disease. Therefore, gefitinib's action is beneficial in the context of heart disease associated with diabetes.\n\n- **Support for the Hypothesis**: The evidence indicates that gefitinib may treat heart disease by protecting endothelial cells from glucose-induced damage. However, the study is limited to cellular models and discusses a potential mechanism rather than clinical outcomes.\n\n- **Assessment of Evidence**: While the study provides a plausible mechanism and initial evidence supporting the hypothesis, it is based on in vitro experiments. There is no direct clinical evidence presented that gefitinib treats heart disease in patients.\n\nAccording to the scoring guidelines:\n\n- **\"+1: The hypothesis is likely supported by the provided texts.

Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to reveal the expression of BASP1 and its biological roles in endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. By analyzing the databases related to diabetes complicated with coronary heart disease, BASP1 was screened out as an upregulated gene. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary mouse aortic endothelial cells were treated with high glucose to establish cell models of diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction, and the expression changes of BASP1 were verified by RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. BASP1 was silenced or overexpressed by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, and its effects on cell migration, apoptosis, tube formation, inflammatory response, and ROS were detected. The possible signaling pathway of BASP1 was found and the mechanism of BASP1 on promoting the progression of endothelial dysfunction was explored using the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the expression of BASP1 in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant coronary heart disease was increased. High glucose induced the upregulation of BASP1 expression in endothelial cells, and showed a time-dependent relationship. Silencing of BASP1 alleviated the damage of high glucose to endothelial cells. BASP1 regulated EGFR positively. The promoting effect of BASP1 on endothelial cell apoptosis may be achieved by regulating the EGFR pathway. BASP1 promotes endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose in patients with diabetes, which may be activated by activating the EGFR pathway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n.\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: gefitinib treats heart disease., which posits an interaction between heart disease and gefitinib. Use only the provided abstracts from PubMed that mention heart disease and gefitinib to inform your analysis.\n\nYour evaluation should:\n\n\u2022 Integrate evidence from all abstracts to discern how heart disease and gefitinib might be interconnected.\n\u2022 Employ logical reasoning, drawing logical inferences where appropriate, based on the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib.\n\u2022 Assess the nature and directionality of the interaction, determining whether they are beneficial or detrimental to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.\n\u2022 Be vigilant for any evidence that contradicts or challenges the hypothesis, explicitly addressing any contradictions in your reasoning.\n\u2022 Avoid inferring effects not supported by the texts, ensuring that all conclusions are grounded in the provided information.\n\u2022 Ensure that your scoring reflects an unbiased assessment based solely on the provided evidence, considering logical inferences from evidence.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\u2022 **Example 1: Strong Positive Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** gefitinib treats heart disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Multiple abstracts show that gefitinib **inhibits processes that worsen heart disease**.\n     Inhibition of these processes significantly **improves heart disease** in various contexts.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     Since gefitinib inhibits harmful processes, and inhibition of these processes improves heart disease, there is strong, consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The interactions are consistent and beneficial.\n     **Assigned Score:** **+2**\n\n\u2022 **Example 2: Likely Positive Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** gefitinib treats heart disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Some abstracts suggest that gefitinib **may activate beneficial pathways affecting heart disease**.\n     Activation of these pathways might improve heart disease, but evidence is limited or not robust.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     There is evidence indicating potential beneficial interaction, but some uncertainty exists due to limited data or minor contradictions.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The hypothesis is likely supported by the evidence.\n     **Assigned Score:** **+1**\n\n\u2022 **Example 3: Neutral Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** gefitinib treats heart disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Abstracts provide insufficient or inconclusive information about the interaction.\n     Evidence might be mixed or does not directly relate to the hypothesis.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     There is not enough evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The evidence is inconclusive.\n     **Assigned Score:** **0**\n\n\u2022 **Example 4: Likely Negative Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** gefitinib treats heart disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Some abstracts indicate that gefitinib **activates processes that worsen heart disease**.\n     Activation of these processes may worsen heart disease, but evidence is limited or not definitive.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     There is substantial indication that the interaction may be detrimental to the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or exceptions exist.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The hypothesis is likely refuted based on the evidence.\n     **Assigned Score:** **-1**\n\n\u2022 **Example 5: Strong Negative Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** gefitinib treats heart disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Multiple abstracts consistently show that gefitinib **inhibits beneficial processes for heart disease**.\n     Inhibition of these processes clearly worsens heart disease across various studies.\n     No evidence suggests any interaction aligns with supporting the hypothesis.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     Since gefitinib inhibits beneficial processes, and inhibition of these processes worsens heart disease, the hypothesis is clearly refuted by strong, consistent evidence.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The interaction does not align with supporting the hypothesis.\n     **Assigned Score:** **-2**\n\nYour goal is to determine the degree of support for the hypothesis:\n\ngefitinib treats heart disease.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Review each abstract** to understand how heart disease and gefitinib might be interconnected based on the available information.\n2. **Analyze the presence and implications** of the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib in the context of the hypothesis.\n3. **Carefully assess whether the interaction is beneficial or detrimental** to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.\n4. **Synthesize the findings from multiple texts**, considering how the pieces fit together to support or refute the hypothesis: gefitinib treats heart disease..\n5. **Provide a justification for your scoring decision** based on the analysis. **Explain your reasoning step-by-step** in terms understandable to an undergraduate biochemist. Focus on:\n   - **Explaining the logical connections and the directionality of relationships.**\n   - **Determining whether the interaction supports or contradicts the hypothesis**, using evidence and logical inferences.\n   - **Assessing if the interaction is beneficial or detrimental** to the proposed outcome.\n6. **Be vigilant for any evidence that contradicts or challenges the hypothesis**. Address any contradictions explicitly in your reasoning.\n7. **Verify any assumptions about the roles and effects** of heart disease and gefitinib as presented in the abstracts. **Avoid inferring effects not supported by the texts**.\n8. In your final assessment, **explicitly cite the scoring guideline** that corresponds to your conclusion. **Explain why the evidence meets the criteria for that specific score**.\n\n**Note:** Pay close attention to the nature of the interaction between entities. An interaction that activates a harmful process may be detrimental, while inhibition of a beneficial process may also be detrimental. **Consider whether such interaction contradicts the hypothesis**.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\u2022 **Evidence:** Multiple sources agree and provide clear indications supporting a particular interaction and its effects.\n\u2022 **Contradictory Evidence:** Evidence that directly opposes the hypothesis, showing that the proposed mechanism of action does not produce the expected outcome.\n\n**Checklist Before Finalizing Your Response:**\n\u2022 Have you **addressed whether the interaction supports or contradicts the hypothesis**?\n\u2022 Have you **assessed if the interaction is beneficial or detrimental**?\n\u2022 Have you **explicitly cited the scoring guideline** that matches your conclusion?\n\u2022 Have you **explained why the evidence meets the criteria** for the assigned score?\n\n**Format your response as:**\n\nScore: \\[Number\\] Point(s) - Reasoning: \\[Reasoning\\]\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n\u2022 **-2:** The hypothesis is **refuted** by consistent evidence indicating that the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib **contradicts** the proposed outcome.\n\u2022 **-1:** The hypothesis is **likely refuted** based on the evidence. There is moderate indication that the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib **contradicts** the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n\u2022 **0:** The hypothesis is **neither supported nor refuted** by the provided texts. The evidence regarding the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib is inconclusive, mixed, lacks sufficient detail, or there is a lack of evidence.\n\u2022 **+1:** The hypothesis is **likely supported** by the provided texts. The evidence suggests that the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib may **align with** the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n\u2022 **+2:** The hypothesis is **supported** by consistent evidence indicating that the interaction between heart disease and gefitinib **aligns with** the proposed outcome, with no significant contradictory evidence.",
