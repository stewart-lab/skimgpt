Title: Human receptor activation by aroclor 1260, a polychlorinated biphenyl mixture.
Abstract: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental toxicants, present in 100% of U.S. adults and dose-dependently associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PCBs are predicted to interact with receptors previously implicated in xenobiotic/energy metabolism and NAFLD. These receptors include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver-X-receptor (LXRα), and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). This study evaluates Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture with congener composition mimicking that of human adipose tissue, and selected congeners, as potential ligands for these receptors utilizing human hepatoma-derived (HepG2) and primate-derived (COS-1) cell lines, and primary human hepatocytes. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) activated AhR, and PCB 126, a minor component, was a potent inducer. Aroclor 1260 activated PXR in a simple concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ≥10 μg/ml. Among the congeners tested, PCBs 138, 149, 151, 174, 183, 187, and 196 activated PXR. Aroclor 1260 activated CAR2 and CAR3 variants at lower concentrations and antagonize CAR2 activation by the CAR agonist, CITCO, at higher concentrations (≥20 μg/ml). Additionally, Aroclor 1260 induced CYP2B6 in primary hepatocytes. At subtoxic doses, Aroclor 1260 did not activate LXR or FXR and had no effect on LXR- or FXR-dependent induction by the agonists T0901317 or GW4064, respectively. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) suppressed PPARα activation by the agonist nafenopin, although none of the congeners tested demonstrated significant inhibition. The results suggest that Aroclor 1260 is a human AhR, PXR and CAR3 agonist, a mixed agonist/antagonist for CAR2, and an antagonist for human PPARα.

Title: AhR, PXR and CAR: From Xenobiotic Receptors to Metabolic Sensors.
Abstract: Traditionally, xenobiotic receptors are known for their role in chemical sensing and detoxification, as receptor activation regulates the expression of various key enzymes and receptors. However, recent studies have highlighted that xenobiotic receptors also play a key role in the regulation of lipid metabolism and therefore function also as metabolic sensors. Since dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for various cardiometabolic diseases, like atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, it is of major importance to understand the molecular mechanisms that are regulated by xenobiotic receptors. In this review, three major xenobiotic receptors will be discussed, being the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Specifically, this review will focus on recent insights into the metabolic functions of these receptors, especially in the field of lipid metabolism and the associated dyslipidemia.

Title: Mortality in biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: results from a nationwide cohort.
Abstract: Population-based data are lacking regarding the risk of overall and cause-specific mortality across the complete histological spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This nationwide, matched cohort study included all individuals in Sweden with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (1966 to 2017; n=10 568). NAFLD was confirmed histologically from all liver biopsies submitted to Sweden's 28 pathology departments, after excluding other etiologies of liver disease, and further categorised as, simple steatosis, non-fibrotic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-cirrhotic fibrosis and cirrhosis. NAFLD cases were matched to ≤5 general population comparators by age, sex, calendar year and county (n=49 925). Using Cox regression, we estimated multivariable-adjusted HRs (aHRs) and 95% CIs. Over a median of 14.2 years, 4,338 NAFLD patients died. Compared with controls, NAFLD patients had significantly increased overall mortality (16.9 vs 28.6/1000 PY; difference=11.7/1000 PY; aHR=1.93, 95% CI=1.86 to 2.00). Compared with controls, significant excess mortality risk was observed with simple steatosis (8.3/1000 PY, aHR=1.71, 95% CI=1.64 to 1.79), non-fibrotic NASH (13.4/1000 PY, aHR=2.14, 95% CI=1.93 to 2.38), non-cirrhotic fibrosis (18.4/1000 PY, aHR=2.44, 95% CI=2.22 to 2.69) and cirrhosis (53.6/1000 PY, aHR=3.79, 95% CI=3.34 to 4.30)(p<sub>trend</sub> <0.01). This dose-dependent gradient was similar when simple steatosis was the reference (p<sub>trend</sub> <0.01). The excess mortality associated with NAFLD was primarily from extrahepatic cancer (4.5/1000 PY, aHR=2.16, 95% CI=2.03 to 2.30), followed by cirrhosis (2.7/1000 PY, aHR=18.15, 95% CI=14.78 to 22.30), cardiovascular disease (1.4/1000 PY, aHR=1.35, 95% CI=1.26 to 1.44) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1.2/1000 PY, aHR=11.12, 95% CI=8.65 to 14.30). All NAFLD histological stages were associated with significantly increased overall mortality, and this risk increased progressively with worsening NAFLD histology. Most of this excess mortality was from extrahepatic cancer and cirrhosis, while in contrast, the contributions of cardiovascular disease and HCC were modest.

Title: Characterizing the impact of simvastatin co-treatment of cell specific TCDD-induced gene expression and systemic toxicity.
Abstract: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in humans and elicits pathologies in rodents that resemble non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis, an aspect of MetS, is linked to NAFLD pathogenesis. TCDD exposure is also linked to the suppression of genes that encode key cholesterol biosynthesis steps and changes in serum cholesterol levels. In a previous experiment, treating mice with TCDD in the presence of simvastatin, a 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase competitive inhibitor, altered lipid and glycogen levels, AHR-battery gene expression, and liver injury in male mice compared to TCDD alone. The aim of this study was to deduce a possible mechanism(s) for the metabolic changes and increased injury using single-nuclei RNA sequencing in mouse liver. We demonstrated that co-treated mice experienced wasting and increased AHR activation compared to TCDD alone. Furthermore, relative proportions of cell (sub)types were different between TCDD alone and co-treated mice including important mediators of NAFLD progression like hepatocytes and immune cell populations. Analysis of non-overlapping differentially expressed genes identified several pathways where simvastatin co-treatment significantly impacted TCDD-induced changes, which may explain the differences between treatments. Overall, these results demonstrate a connection between dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis and toxicant-induced metabolic changes.

Title: Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal signatures of lipid metabolism dysregulation in HepaRG liver cells exposed to PCB 126.
Abstract: Chemical pollutant exposure is a risk factor contributing to the growing epidemic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affecting human populations that consume a western diet. Although it is recognized that intoxication by chemical pollutants can lead to NAFLD, there is limited information available regarding the mechanism by which typical environmental levels of exposure can contribute to the onset of this disease. Here, we describe the alterations in gene expression profiles and metabolite levels in the human HepaRG liver cell line, a validated model for cellular steatosis, exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 126, one of the most potent chemical pollutants that can induce NAFLD. Sparse partial least squares classification of the molecular profiles revealed that exposure to PCB 126 provoked a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as an increase in sphingolipid levels, concomitant with a decrease in the activity of genes involved in lipid metabolism. This was associated with an increased oxidative stress reflected by marked disturbances in taurine metabolism. A gene ontology analysis showed hallmarks of an activation of the AhR receptor by dioxin-like compounds. These changes in metabolome and transcriptome profiles were observed even at the lowest concentration (100 pM) of PCB 126 tested. A decrease in docosatrienoate levels was the most sensitive biomarker. Overall, our integrated multi-omics analysis provides mechanistic insight into how this class of chemical pollutant can cause NAFLD. Our study lays the foundation for the development of molecular signatures of toxic effects of chemicals causing fatty liver diseases to move away from a chemical risk assessment based on in vivo animal experiments.

Title: Control of T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Abstract: Regulatory T cells (T(reg)) expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 control the autoreactive components of the immune system. The development of T(reg) cells is reciprocally related to that of pro-inflammatory T cells producing interleukin-17 (T(H)17). Although T(reg) cell dysfunction and/or T(H)17 cell dysregulation are thought to contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders, little is known about the physiological pathways that control the generation of these cell lineages. Here we report the identification of the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a regulator of T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in mice. AHR activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induced functional T(reg) cells that suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, AHR activation by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole interfered with T(reg) cell development, boosted T(H)17 cell differentiation and increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Thus, AHR regulates both T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in a ligand-specific fashion, constituting a unique target for therapeutic immunomodulation.

Title: Intestinal Translocation of Live <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> Drives Insulin Resistance.
Abstract: Periodontitis has been emphasized as a risk factor of insulin resistance-related systemic diseases. Accumulating evidence has suggested a possible ""oral-gut axis"" linking oral infection and extraoral diseases, but it remains unclear whether periodontal pathogens can survive the barriers of the digestive tract and how they play their pathogenic roles. The present study established a periodontitis mouse model through oral ligature plus <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> inoculation and demonstrated that periodontitis aggravated diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, while also causing <i>P. gingivalis</i> enrichment in the intestine. Metabolic labeling strategy validated that <i>P. gingivalis</i> could translocate to the gastrointestinal tract in a viable state. Oral administration of living <i>P. gingivalis</i> elicited insulin resistance, while administration of pasteurized <i>P. gingivalis</i> had no such effect. Combination analysis of metagenome sequencing and nontargeted metabolomics suggested that the tryptophan metabolism pathway, specifically indole and its derivatives, was involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance caused by oral administration of living <i>P. gingivalis</i>. Moreover, liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, mainly indole acetic acid, tryptamine, and indole-3-aldehyde, were reduced in diet-induced obese mice with periodontitis, leading to inactivation of AhR signaling. Supplementation with Ficz (6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole), an AhR agonist, alleviated periodontitis-associated insulin resistance, in which the restoration of gut barrier function might play an important role. Collectively, these findings reveal that the oral-gut translocation of viable <i>P. gingivalis</i> works as a fuel linking periodontitis and insulin resistance, in which reduction of AhR ligands and inactivation of AhR signaling are involved. This study provides novel insight into the role of the oral-gut axis in the pathogenesis of periodontitis-associated comorbidities.

Title: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-induced signals up-regulate IL-22 production and inhibit inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.
Abstract: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is believed to involve an altered balance between effector and regulatory T cells. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the toxicity of dioxins, controls T-cell responses. We investigated the role of AhR in inflammation and pathogenesis of IBD in humans and mouse models. AhR expression was evaluated in intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBD and controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were activated in the presence or absence of the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (Ficz). Colitis was induced in mice using trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), or T-cell transfer. Mice were given injections of Ficz or the AhR antagonist 2-metyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid; some mice first received injections of a blocking antibody against interleukin (IL)-22. Cytokines were quantified by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Intestine tissue from patients with IBD expressed significantly less AhR than controls. In LPMCs from patients with IBD, incubation with Ficz reduced levels of interferon gamma (IFN)-γ and up-regulated IL-22. Mice injected with Ficz were protected against TNBS-, DSS-, and T-cell transfer-induced colitis; they had marked down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and induction of IL-22. Mice given AhR antagonist produced more inflammatory cytokines and less IL-22 and developed a severe colitis. Neutralization of endogenous IL-22 disrupted the protective effect of Ficz on TNBS-induced colitis. AhR is down-regulated in intestinal tissue of patients with IBD; AhR signaling, via IL-22, inhibits inflammation and colitis in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. AhR-related compounds might be developed to treat patients with IBDs.

Title: Disrupting Development: Unraveling the Interplay of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) and Wnt/β-Catenin Pathways in Kidney Development Under the Influence of Environmental Pollutants.
Abstract: Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms governing aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Wnt/β-Catenin pathways crosstalk is of paramount importance for elucidating normal development. We investigated the repercussions of aberrant activation of these signaling pathways on kidney development. HEK-293 cells were subjected to AHR and Wnt activators and inhibitors for 3 and 24 h. Subsequently, pregnant adult female BALB/c mice were administered treatments at gestation day 9 (GD-9), and embryos were analyzed at GD-18 using a combination of cellular, molecular, stereological, and histopathological techniques. Our results demonstrated a noteworthy escalation in oxidative stress and gene expression endpoints associated with apoptosis. Moreover, stereological analyses exhibited alterations in cortex, proximal tubule, and kidney tissue vessels volumes. Remarkably, co-treatment with 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ) and cadmium (Cd) resulted in a significant reduction in glomerulus volume, while elevating the volumes of distal tubule, Henle loop, and connective tissue, compared to the control group. Histopathological investigations further confirmed structural changes in the loop of Henle and proximal tubule, alongside a decline in glomerular volume. Additionally, the expression levels of AHR and Ctnnb1 genes significantly increased in the Cd-treated group compared to the control group. Enhanced expression of apoptosis-related genes, including Bcl-x, Bax, and Caspase3, along with alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release, was observed. In contrast, Gsk3 gene expression was significantly decreased. Our findings robustly establish that chemical pollutants, such as Cd, disrupt the AHR and Wnt/β-Catenin physiological roles during developmental stages by inhibiting the metabolic degradation of FICZ.

Title: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor in immunity.
Abstract: Low-molecular-weight chemicals or xenobiotics might contribute to the increasing prevalence of allergies and autoimmunity. Certain chemicals can alter immune responses via their action on the cytosolic transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR recognizes numerous small xenobiotic and natural molecules, such as dioxin and the tryptophan photoproduct 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole. Although AhR is best known for mediating dioxin toxicity, knockout studies have indicated that AhR also plays a role in normal physiology, including certain immune responses. In particular, Th17 cells and dendritic cells express high levels of AhR. We review here current evidence for the physiological role of AhR in the immune system, focussing in particular on T-cell biology.
