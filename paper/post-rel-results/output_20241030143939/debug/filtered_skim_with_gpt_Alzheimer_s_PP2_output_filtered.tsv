Title: Diffusible, nonfibrillar ligands derived from Abeta1-42 are potent central nervous system neurotoxins.
Abstract: Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.

Title: Neuroprotective effect of the traditional decoction Tian-Si-Yin against Alzheimer's disease via suppression of neuroinflammation.
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease among old adults. As a traditional Chinese medicine, the herbal decoction Tian-Si-Yin consists of Morinda officinalis How. and Cuscuta chinensis Lam., which has been widely used to nourish kidney. Interestingly, Tian-Si-Yin has also been used to treat dementia, depression and other neurological conditions. However, its therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of the herbal formula Tian-Si-Yin against AD and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The N2a cells treated with amyloid β (Aβ) peptide or overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) were used to establish cellular models of AD. The in vivo anti-AD effects were evaluated by using Caenorhabditis elegans and 3 × Tg-AD mouse models. Tian-Si-Yin was orally administered to the mice for 8 weeks at a dose of 10, 15 or 20 mg/kg/day, respectively. Its protective role on memory deficits of mice was examined using the Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests. Network pharmacology, proteomic analysis and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, which were further investigated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Tian-Si-Yin was shown to improve cell viability of Aβ-treated N2a cells and APP-expressing N2a-APP cells. Tian-Si-Yin was also found to reduce ROS level and extend lifespan of transgenic AD-like C. elegans model. Oral administration of Tian-Si-Yin at medium dose was able to effectively rescue memory impairment in 3 × Tg mice. Tian-Si-Yin was further shown to suppress neuroinflammation by inhibition of glia cell activation and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, diminishing tau phosphoralytion and Aβ deposition in the mice. Using UHPLC-MS/MS and network pharmacology technologies, 17 phytochemicals from 68 components of Tian-Si-Yin were identified as potential anti-AD components. MAPK1, BRAF, TTR and Fyn were identified as anti-AD targets of Tian-Si-Yin from network pharmacology and mass spectrum. This study has established the protective effect of Tian-Si-Yin against AD and demonstrates that Tian-Si-Yin is capable of improving Aβ level, tau pathology and synaptic disorder by regulating inflammatory response.

Title: Dendritic function of tau mediates amyloid-beta toxicity in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. It has emerged that Abeta toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Deltatau) and absence of tau in tau(-/-) mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Abeta toxicity. Deltatau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Abeta-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Abeta toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD.

Title: Unveiling Phytoconstituents with Inhibitory Potential Against Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Fyn: A Comprehensive Virtual Screening Approach Targeting Alzheimer's Disease.
Abstract: Tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn (Fyn) is a critical signaling molecule involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and disease pathogenesis. Dysregulation of Fyn kinase has been implicated in various complex diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as different cancer types. Therefore, identifying small molecule inhibitors that can inhibit Fyn activity holds substantial significance in drug discovery. The aim of this study was to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors among bioactive phytoconstituents against tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn. Through a comprehensive approach involving molecular docking, drug likeliness filters, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we performed a virtual screening of a natural compounds library. This methodology aimed to pinpoint compounds potentially interacting with Fyn kinase and inhibiting its activity. This study finds two potential natural compounds: Dehydromillettone and Tanshinone B. These compoundsdemonstrated substantial affinity and specific interactions towards the Fyn binding pocket. Their conformations exhibitedcompatibility and stability, indicating the formation of robust protein-ligand complexes. A significant array of non-covalentinteractions supported the structural integrity of these complexes. Dehydromillettone and Tanshinone B emerge as promising candidates, poised for further optimization as Fynkinase inhibitors with therapeutic applications. In a broader context, this study demonstrates the potential of computationaldrug discovery, underscoring its utility in identifying compounds with clinical significance. The identified inhibitors holdpromise in addressing a spectrum of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. However, their efficacy and safety necessitatevalidation through subsequent experimental studies.

Title: Amyloid-β/Fyn-induced synaptic, network, and cognitive impairments depend on tau levels in multiple mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is a growing public health problem and still lacks effective treatments. Recent evidence suggests that microtubule-associated protein tau may mediate amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) toxicity by modulating the tyrosine kinase Fyn. We showed previously that tau reduction prevents, and Fyn overexpression exacerbates, cognitive deficits in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice overexpressing Aβ. However, the mechanisms by which Aβ, tau, and Fyn cooperate in AD-related pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. Here we examined the synaptic and network effects of this pathogenic triad. Tau reduction prevented cognitive decline induced by synergistic effects of Aβ and Fyn. Tau reduction also prevented synaptic transmission and plasticity deficits in hAPP mice. Using electroencephalography to examine network effects, we found that tau reduction prevented spontaneous epileptiform activity in multiple lines of hAPP mice. Tau reduction also reduced the severity of spontaneous and chemically induced seizures in mice overexpressing both Aβ and Fyn. To better understand these protective effects, we recorded whole-cell currents in acute hippocampal slices from hAPP mice with and without tau. hAPP mice with tau had increased spontaneous and evoked excitatory currents, reduced inhibitory currents, and NMDA receptor dysfunction. Tau reduction increased inhibitory currents and normalized excitation/inhibition balance and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in hAPP mice. Our results indicate that Aβ, tau, and Fyn jointly impair synaptic and network function and suggest that disrupting the copathogenic relationship between these factors could be of therapeutic benefit.

Title: alpha 7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to block A beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity.
Abstract: Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD.

Title: Oligomeric Aβ25-35 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs in rat hippocampal CA1 subfield.
Abstract: Although amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the mechanisms of Aβ neurotoxicity remain to be clarified. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Aβ on postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) tyrosine phosphorylation. Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying it may be a promising therapy in AD. Aβ25-35 oligomers (20 μg/rat) were administered intracerebroventricularly in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot was applied for measuring the protein levels of PSD-95 and β-actin. Following 3, 7, 14, 21 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 increased significantly, and peaked at 3 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment in hippocampal CA1 subfield. Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SrcPTKs) specific inhibitor PP2 attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 induced by Aβ25-35. Amantadine [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor noncompetitive antagonist], NVP-AAM077 (GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) and Ro25-6981 (GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) also suppressed the Aβ25-35-induced PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that Aβ oligomers induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs, which is mediated by the activation of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors.

Title: Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of neuronal proteins including tau and focal adhesion kinase in response to amyloid-beta peptide exposure: involvement of Src family protein kinases.
Abstract: The increased production of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease is acknowledged to be a key pathogenic event. In this study, we examined the response of primary human and rat brain cortical cultures to Abeta administration and found a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation content of numerous neuronal proteins, including tau and putative microtubule-associated protein 2c (MAP2c). We also found that paired helical filaments of aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau are tyrosine phosphorylated, indicating that changes in the phosphotyrosine content of cytoplasmic proteins in response to Abeta are potentially an important process. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and other neuronal proteins was specific to fibrillar Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(1-42). The tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by addition of the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7(t-butyl)pyrazol(3,4-d)pyramide (PP2) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Tyrosine phosphorylation of tau and MAP2c was concomitant with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent putative activation of the non-receptor kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Immunoprecipitation of Fyn, a member of the Src family, from Abeta(25-35)-treated neurons showed an increased association of Fyn with FAK. Abeta treatment of cells also stimulated the sustained activation of extracellular regulated kinase-2, which was blocked by addition of PP2 and LY 294002, suggesting that FAK/Fyn/PI3-kinase association is upstream of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in Abeta-treated neurons. This cascade of signaling events contains the earliest biochemical changes in neurons to be described in response to Abeta exposure and may be critical for subsequent neurodegenerative changes.

Title: Oligomer β-amyloid Induces Hyperactivation of Ras to Impede NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal CA1 of Mice.
Abstract: The activity of Ras, a small GTPase protein, is increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> on the activation of Ras, and the involvement of the Ras hyperactivity in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced deficits in spatial cognition and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in mice (Aβ-mice) enhanced hippocampal Ras activation and expression, while 60 min incubation of hippocampal slices in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ-slices) only elevated Ras activity. Aβ-mice showed deficits in spatial cognition and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, but basal synaptic transmission was enhanced. The above effects of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> were corrected by the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS). ERK2 phosphorylation increased, and Src phosphorylation decreased in Aβ-mice and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices. Both were corrected by FTS. In CA1 pyramidal cells of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, the response of AMPA receptor and phosphorylation of GluR1 were enhanced with dependence on Ras activation rather than ERK signaling. In contrast, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function and GluN2A/2B phosphorylation were downregulated in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, which was recovered by application of FTS or the Src activator ouabain, and mimicked in control slices treated with the Src inhibitor PP2. The administration of PP2 impaired the spatial cognition and LTP induction in control mice and FTS-treated Aβ-mice. The treatment of Aβ-mice with ouabain rescued Aβ-impaired spatial cognition and LTP. Overall, the results indicate that the oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> hyperactivates Ras and thereby causes the downregulation of Src which impedes NMDAR-dependent LTP induction resulting in cognitive deficits.

Title: Tyrosine 394 is phosphorylated in Alzheimer's paired helical filament tau and in fetal tau with c-Abl as the candidate tyrosine kinase.
Abstract: Tau is a major microtubule-associated protein of axons and is also the principal component of the paired helical filaments (PHFs) that comprise the neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Besides phosphorylation of tau on serine and threonine residues in both normal tau and tau from neurofibrillary tangles, Tyr-18 was reported to be a site of phosphorylation by the Src-family kinase Fyn. We examined whether tyrosine residues other than Tyr-18 are phosphorylated in tau and whether other tyrosine kinases might phosphorylate tau. Using mass spectrometry, we positively identified phosphorylated Tyr-394 in PHF-tau from an Alzheimer brain and in human fetal brain tau. When wild-type human tau was transfected into fibroblasts or neuroblastoma cells, treatment with pervanadate caused tau to become phosphorylated on tyrosine by endogenous kinases. By replacing each of the five tyrosines in tau with phenylalanine, we identified Tyr-394 as the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation in tau. Tyrosine phosphorylation of tau was inhibited by PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), which is known to inhibit Src-family kinases and c-Abl. Cotransfection of tau and kinases showed that Tyr-18 was the major site for Fyn phosphorylation, but Tyr-394 was the main residue for Abl. In vitro, Abl phosphorylated tau directly. Abl could be coprecipitated with tau and was present in pretangle neurons in brain sections from Alzheimer cases. These results show that phosphorylation of tau on Tyr-394 is a physiological event that is potentially part of a signal relay and suggest that Abl could have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer's disease.

Title: Pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases axl and fyn reduces TNF-α-induced endothelial inflammatory activation <i>in vitro</i>.
Abstract: Major surgery induces systemic inflammation leading to pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Endothelial inflammation is one of the drivers of postoperative organ damage, including acute kidney injury Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) is an important component of surgery-induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Kinases, the backbone of signalling cascades, can be targeted by pharmacological inhibition. This is a promising treatment option to interfere with excessive endothelial inflammation. In this study, we identified activated kinases as potential therapeutic targets. These targets were pharmacologically inhibited to reduce TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells. Kinome profiling using PamChip arrays identified 64 protein tyrosine kinases and 88 serine-threonine kinases, the activity of which was determined at various timepoints (5-240 min) following stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. The PTKs Axl and Fyn were selected based on high kinase activity profiles. Co-localisation experiments with the endothelial-specific protein CD31 showed Axl expression in endothelial cells of glomeruli and Fyn in arterioles and glomeruli of both control and TNF-α-exposed mice. Pharmacological inhibition with Axl inhibitor BMS-777607 and Fyn inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory activation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 at mRNA and VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 at protein level in HUVEC <i>in vitro</i>. Upon pharmacological inhibition with each inhibitor, leukocyte adhesion to HUVEC was also significantly reduced, however to a minor extent. In conclusion, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with kinase inhibitors BMS-777607 and PP2 reduces TNF-α-induced endothelial inflammation <i>in vitro</i>.

Title: EGF-R signaling through Fyn kinase disrupts the function of integrin alpha6beta4 at hemidesmosomes: role in epithelial cell migration and carcinoma invasion.
Abstract: We have examined the mechanism and functional significance of hemidesmosome disassembly during normal epithelial cell migration and squamous carcinoma invasion. Our findings indicate that a fraction of EGF receptor (EGF-R) combines with the hemidesmosomal integrin alpha6beta4 in both normal and neoplastic keratinocytes. Activation of the EGF-R causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta4 cytoplasmic domain and disruption of hemidesmosomes. The Src family kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2 prevent tyrosine phosphorylation of beta4 and disassembly of hemidesmosomes without interfering with the activation of EGF-R. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Fyn and, to a lesser extent, Yes combine with alpha6beta4. By contrast, Src and Lck do not associate with alpha6beta4 to a significant extent. A dominant negative form of Fyn, but not Src, prevents tyrosine phosphorylation of beta4 and disassembly of hemidesmosomes. These observations suggest that the EGF-R causes disassembly of hemidesmosomes by activating Fyn, which in turn phosphorylates the beta4 cytoplasmic domain. Neoplastic cells expressing dominant negative Fyn display increased hemidesmosomes and migrate poorly in vitro in response to EGF. Furthermore, dominant negative Fyn decreases the ability of squamous carcinoma cells to invade through Matrigel in vitro and to form lung metastases following intravenous injection in nude mice. These results suggest that disruption of hemidesmosomes mediated by Fyn is a prerequisite for normal keratinocyte migration and squamous carcinoma invasion.

Title: The Src-Kinase Fyn is Required for Cocaine-Associated Memory Through Regulation of Tau.
Abstract: Drug-associated context-induced relapse of cocaine-seeking behaviour requires the retrieval of drug-associated memory. Studies exploring the underlying neurobiological mechanism of drug memory formation will likely contribute to the development of treatments for drug addiction and the prevention of relapse. In our study, we applied a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and a self-administration paradigm (two drug-associated memory formation model) to confirm the hypothesis that the Src kinase Fyn critically regulates cocaine-associated memory formation in the hippocampus. For this experiment, we administered the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 into the bilateral hippocampus before cocaine-CPP and self-administration training, and the results showed that pharmacological manipulation of the Src kinase Fyn activity significantly attenuated the response to cocaine-paired cues in the cocaine-CPP and self-administration paradigms, indicating that hippocampal Fyn activity contributes to cocaine-associated memory formation. In addition, the regulation of cocaine-associated memory formation by Fyn depends on Tau expression, as restoring Tau to normal levels disrupted cocaine memory formation. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal Fyn activity plays a key role in the formation of cocaine-associated memory, which underlies cocaine-associated contextual stimulus-mediated regulation of cocaine-seeking behaviour, suggesting that Fyn represents a promising therapeutic target for weakening cocaine-related memory and treating cocaine addiction.

Title: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promotes cell survival by activation of the Akt pathway and role for CSN5/JAB1 in the control of autocrine MIF activity.
Abstract: The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays an important role in cell survival and the development of cancer. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a critical inflammatory cytokine that was recently associated with tumorigenesis and that potently inhibits apoptosis. This may involve inhibition of p53-dependent genes, but the initiating molecular mechanism of how MIF controls survival/apoptosis is unknown. Here, we show that MIF prevents apoptosis and promotes tumor cell survival by directly activating the Akt pathway. MIF enhanced Akt activity in primary and immortalized fibroblasts (MEF and NIH/3T3), HeLa cervix carcinoma cells and various breast cancer cell lines. Activation was abolished by kinase inhibitors Ly294002 and PP2 and in Src/Yes/Fyn(SYF)(-/-) and CD74(-/-)(MEFs), while being enhanced in CD74-overexpressing MEFs, demonstrating that the MIF-induced Akt pathway encompasses signaling through the MIF receptor CD74 and the upstream kinases Src and PI3K. Akt was activated by exogenous rMIF and autocrine MIF action, as revealed by experiments in MIF(-/-)MEFs and antibody blockade. siRNA knockdown of CSN5/JAB1, a tumor marker and MIF-binding protein, showed that JAB1 controls autocrine MIF-mediated Akt signaling by inhibition of MIF secretion. Akt activation by MIF led to phosphorylation of the proapoptotic proteins BAD and Foxo3a. Apoptosis inhibition by MIF was functionally associated with Akt activation as it was abolished by overexpression of the Akt pathway inhibitor PTEN and occurred independently of p53. This was shown by studying DNA damage-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts, the Fas death pathway in HeLa cells that do not express functional p53, and etoposide-induced apoptosis in breast carcinoma cells expressing mutant p53. Importantly, dependence of breast cancer cell survival on MIF correlated with Akt activation and the PTEN status of these cells. Thus, MIF can directly promote cell survival through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and this effect is critical for tumor cell survival.
