Title: Genetic variation in GIPR influences the glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge.
Abstract: Glucose levels 2 h after an oral glucose challenge are a clinical measure of glucose tolerance used in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We report a meta-analysis of nine genome-wide association studies (n = 15,234 nondiabetic individuals) and a follow-up of 29 independent loci (n = 6,958-30,620). We identify variants at the GIPR locus associated with 2-h glucose level (rs10423928, beta (s.e.m.) = 0.09 (0.01) mmol/l per A allele, P = 2.0 x 10(-15)). The GIPR A-allele carriers also showed decreased insulin secretion (n = 22,492; insulinogenic index, P = 1.0 x 10(-17); ratio of insulin to glucose area under the curve, P = 1.3 x 10(-16)) and diminished incretin effect (n = 804; P = 4.3 x 10(-4)). We also identified variants at ADCY5 (rs2877716, P = 4.2 x 10(-16)), VPS13C (rs17271305, P = 4.1 x 10(-8)), GCKR (rs1260326, P = 7.1 x 10(-11)) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 4.2 x 10(-10)) associated with 2-h glucose. Of the three newly implicated loci (GIPR, ADCY5 and VPS13C), only ADCY5 was found to be associated with type 2 diabetes in collaborating studies (n = 35,869 cases, 89,798 controls, OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.09-1.15, P = 4.8 x 10(-18)).

Title: Phosphorylation Sites of the Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide Receptor (GIPR) Revealed by Trapped-Ion-Mobility Spectrometry Coupled to Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TIMS-TOF MS).
Abstract: The gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, is a target for the development of therapeutic agents to address type 2 diabetes and obesity. Signal transduction processes mediated by GPCR activation typically result in receptor phosphorylation, but very little is known about GIPR phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for detecting phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of proteins and for identifying modification sites. However, applying MS methods to GPCRs is challenging because the native expression levels are low and the hydrophobicity of these proteins complicates isolation and enrichment. Here we use a widely available technique, trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOF MS), to characterize the phosphorylation status of the GIPR. We identified eight serine residues that are phosphorylated, one in an intracellular loop and the remainder in the C-terminal domain. Stimulation with the native agonist GIP enhanced phosphorylation at four of these sites. For comparison, we evaluated tirzepatide (TZP), a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the GIPR that has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Stimulation with TZP enhanced phosphorylation at the same four sites that were enhanced with GIP; however, TZP also enhanced phosphorylation at a fifth site that is unique to this synthetic agonist. This work establishes an important and accessible tool for the characterization of signal transduction via the GIPR and reveals an unanticipated functional difference between GIP and TZP.

Title: Glucose intolerance caused by a defect in the entero-insular axis: a study in gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor knockout mice.
Abstract: Mice with a targeted mutation of the gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor gene (GIPR) were generated to determine the role of GIP as a mediator of signals from the gut to pancreatic beta cells. GIPR-/- mice have higher blood glucose levels with impaired initial insulin response after oral glucose load. Although blood glucose levels after meal ingestion are not increased by high-fat diet in GIPR+/+ mice because of compensatory higher insulin secretion, they are significantly increased in GIPR-/- mice because of the lack of such enhancement. Accordingly, early insulin secretion mediated by GIP determines glucose tolerance after oral glucose load in vivo, and because GIP plays an important role in the compensatory enhancement of insulin secretion produced by a high insulin demand, a defect in this entero-insular axis may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Title: GIP and GLP-1, the two incretin hormones: Similarities and differences.
Abstract: Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are the two primary incretin hormones secreted from the intestine on ingestion of glucose or nutrients to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. GIP and GLP-1 exert their effects by binding to their specific receptors, the GIP receptor (GIPR) and the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family. Receptor binding activates and increases the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in pancreatic β cells, thereby stimulating insulin secretion glucose-dependently. In addition to their insulinotropic effects, GIP and GLP-1 play critical roles in various biological processes in different tissues and organs that express GIPR and GLP-1R, including the pancreas, fat, bone and the brain. Within the pancreas, GIP and GLP-1 together promote β cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, thereby expanding pancreatic β cell mass, while GIP enhances postprandial glucagon response and GLP-1 suppresses it. In adipose tissues, GIP but not GLP-1 facilitates fat deposition. In bone, GIP promotes bone formation while GLP-1 inhibits bone absorption. In the brain, both GIP and GLP-1 are thought to be involved in memory formation as well as the control of appetite. In addition to these differences, secretion of GIP and GLP-1 and their insulinotropic effects on β cells have been shown to differ in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy subjects. We summarize here the similarities and differences of these two incretin hormones in secretion and metabolism, their insulinotropic action on pancreatic β cells, and their non-insulinotropic effects, and discuss their potential in treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Title: Tirzepatide is an imbalanced and biased dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist.
Abstract: Tirzepatide (LY3298176) is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Early phase trials in T2DM indicate that tirzepatide improves clinical outcomes beyond those achieved by a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist. Therefore, we hypothesized that the integrated potency and signaling properties of tirzepatide provide a unique pharmacological profile tailored for improving broad metabolic control. Here, we establish methodology for calculating occupancy of each receptor for clinically efficacious doses of the drug. This analysis reveals a greater degree of engagement of tirzepatide for the GIP receptor than the GLP-1 receptor, corroborating an imbalanced mechanism of action. Pharmacologically, signaling studies demonstrate that tirzepatide mimics the actions of native GIP at the GIP receptor but shows bias at the GLP-1 receptor to favor cAMP generation over β-arrestin recruitment, coincident with a weaker ability to drive GLP-1 receptor internalization compared with GLP-1. Experiments in primary islets reveal β-arrestin1 limits the insulin response to GLP-1, but not GIP or tirzepatide, suggesting that the biased agonism of tirzepatide enhances insulin secretion. Imbalance toward GIP receptor, combined with distinct signaling properties at the GLP-1 receptor, together may account for the promising efficacy of this investigational agent.

Title: Incretin Therapies for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease.
Abstract: Since the early 2000s, an influx of novel glucose-lowering agents has changed the therapeutic landscape for treatment of diabetes and diabetes-related complications. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists represent an important therapeutic class for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), demonstrating benefits beyond glycemic control, including lowering of blood pressure and body weight, and importantly, decreased risk of development of new or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD) and reduced rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Plausible non-glycemic mechanisms that benefit the heart and kidneys with GLP-1 receptor agonists include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Further supporting their use in CKD, the glycemic benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists are preserved in moderate-to-severe CKD. Considering current evidence, major guideline-forming organizations recommend the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in cases of T2D and CKD, especially in those with obesity and/or in those with high cardiovascular risk or established heart disease. Evidence continues to build that supports benefits to the heart and kidneys of the dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist tirzepatide. Ongoing outcome and mechanistic studies will continue to inform our understanding of the role of GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists in diverse patient populations with kidney disease.

Title: Effects of Novel Dual GIP and GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Tirzepatide on Biomarkers of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
Abstract: To determine the effect of tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, on biomarkers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM received either once weekly tirzepatide (1, 5, 10, or 15 mg), dulaglutide (1.5 mg), or placebo for 26 weeks. Changes from baseline in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), keratin-18 (K-18), procollagen III (Pro-C3), and adiponectin were analyzed in a modified intention-to-treat population. Significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05) reductions from baseline in ALT (all groups), AST (all groups except tirzepatide 10 mg), K-18 (tirzepatide 5, 10, 15 mg), and Pro-C3 (tirzepatide 15 mg) were observed at 26 weeks. Decreases with tirzepatide were significant compared with placebo for K-18 (10 mg) and Pro-C3 (15 mg) and with dulaglutide for ALT (10, 15 mg). Adiponectin significantly increased from baseline with tirzepatide compared with placebo (10, 15 mg). In post hoc analyses, higher tirzepatide doses significantly decreased NASH-related biomarkers and increased adiponectin in patients with T2DM.

Title: Tirzepatide-Induced Biphasic Anaphylactic Reaction: A Case Report.
Abstract: Anaphylaxis is a rapid and severe reaction to a trigger that is characterized by skin, mucosal, and cardiorespiratory changes. A minority of patients exhibit a biphasic anaphylactic reaction (BAR). Tirzepatide is a dual incretin receptor analog approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Allergic reactions to tirzepatide were reported during clinical trials, but none were severe enough to be characterized as an anaphylactic reaction. We describe a case of a BAR to tirzepatide.

Title: Tirzepatide versus Semaglutide Once Weekly in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
Abstract: Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide, a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, are unknown. In an open-label, 40-week, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1879 patients, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to receive tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. At baseline, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%, the mean age 56.6 years, and the mean weight 93.7 kg. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks. The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was -2.01 percentage points, -2.24 percentage points, and -2.30 percentage points with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and -1.86 percentage points with semaglutide; the estimated differences between the 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups and the semaglutide group were -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.28 to -0.03; P = 0.02), -0.39 percentage points (95% CI, -0.51 to -0.26; P<0.001), and -0.45 percentage points (95% CI, -0.57 to -0.32; P<0.001), respectively. Tirzepatide at all doses was noninferior and superior to semaglutide. Reductions in body weight were greater with tirzepatide than with semaglutide (least-squares mean estimated treatment difference, -1.9 kg, -3.6 kg, and -5.5 kg, respectively; P<0.001 for all comparisons). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and were primarily mild to moderate in severity in the tirzepatide and semaglutide groups (nausea, 17 to 22% and 18%; diarrhea, 13 to 16% and 12%; and vomiting, 6 to 10% and 8%, respectively). Of the patients who received tirzepatide, hypoglycemia (blood glucose level, <54 mg per deciliter) was reported in 0.6% (5-mg group), 0.2% (10-mg group), and 1.7% (15-mg group); hypoglycemia was reported in 0.4% of those who received semaglutide. Serious adverse events were reported in 5 to 7% of the patients who received tirzepatide and in 3% of those who received semaglutide. In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was noninferior and superior to semaglutide with respect to the mean change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks.

Title: GIPR agonism mediates weight-independent insulin sensitization by tirzepatide in obese mice.
Abstract: Tirzepatide (LY3298176), a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, delivered superior glycemic control and weight loss compared with GLP-1R agonism in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanism by which tirzepatide improves efficacy and how GIP receptor (GIPR) agonism contributes is not fully understood. Here, we show that tirzepatide is an effective insulin sensitizer, improving insulin sensitivity in obese mice to a greater extent than GLP-1R agonism. To determine whether GIPR agonism contributes, we compared the effect of tirzepatide in obese WT and Glp-1r-null mice. In the absence of GLP-1R-induced weight loss, tirzepatide improved insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose disposal in white adipose tissue (WAT). In support of this, a long-acting GIPR agonist (LAGIPRA) was found to enhance insulin sensitivity by augmenting glucose disposal in WAT. Interestingly, the effect of tirzepatide and LAGIPRA on insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and ketoacids in the circulation. Insulin sensitization was associated with upregulation of genes associated with the catabolism of glucose, lipid, and BCAAs in brown adipose tissue. Together, our studies show that tirzepatide improved insulin sensitivity in a weight-dependent and -independent manner. These results highlight how GIPR agonism contributes to the therapeutic profile of dual-receptor agonism, offering mechanistic insights into the clinical efficacy of tirzepatide.

Title: Spatiotemporal GLP-1 and GIP receptor signaling and trafficking/recycling dynamics induced by selected receptor mono- and dual-agonists.
Abstract: We assessed the spatiotemporal GLP-1 and GIP receptor signaling, trafficking, and recycling dynamics of GIPR mono-agonists, GLP-1R mono-agonists including semaglutide, and GLP-1/GIP dual-agonists MAR709 and tirzepatide. Receptor G protein recruitment and internalization/trafficking dynamics were assessed using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based technology and live-cell HILO microscopy. Relative to native and acylated GLP-1 agonists, MAR709 and tirzepatide showed preserved maximal cAMP production despite partial Gα<sub>s</sub> recruitment paralleled by diminished ligand-induced receptor internalization at both target receptors. Despite MAR709's lower internalization rate, GLP-1R co-localization with Rab11-associated recycling endosomes was not different between MAR709 and GLP-1R specific mono-agonists. Our data indicated that MAR709 and tirzepatide induce unique spatiotemporal GLP-1 and GIP receptor signaling, trafficking, and recycling dynamics relative to native peptides, semaglutide, and matched mono-agonist controls. These findings support the hypothesis that the structure of GLP-1/GIP dual-agonists confer a biased agonism that, in addition to its influence on intracellular signaling, uniquely modulates receptor trafficking.

Title: Effect of dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist on weight loss in subjects with obesity.
Abstract: The occurrence of obesity is an increasing issue worldwide, especially in industrialized countries. Weight loss is important both to treat obesity and to prevent the development of complications. Currently, several drugs are used to treat obesity, but their efficacy is modest. Thus, new anti-obesity treatments are needed. Recently, there has been increased interest in the development of incretins that combine body-weight-lowering and glucose-lowering effects. Therefore, a new drug that simultaneously coactivates both the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor (GIPR) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been developed. Tirzepatide, the first in this class, improves glycemic control by increasing insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism as well as by reducing body weight. Combining the activation of the two receptors, greater improvement of β-cell function offers more effective treatment of diabetes and obesity with fewer adverse effects than selective GLP-1R agonists. In the present review, we discuss the progress in the use of GIPR and GLP-1R coagonists and review literature from <i>in vitro</i> studies, animal studies, and human trials, highlighting the synergistic mechanisms of tirzepatide.
