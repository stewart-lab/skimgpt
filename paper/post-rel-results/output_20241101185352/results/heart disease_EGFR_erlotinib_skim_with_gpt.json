Neointimal hyperplasia might play a role in the pathogenesis increasing risk for shunt obstruction. The aim was to evaluate the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix-metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the formation of neointimal within shunts. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-EGFR and anti-MMP-9 on shunts removed at follow-up palliative or corrective procedure. Whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from patients\u00b4 blood samples and allele frequencies were compared between the group of patients with shunts displaying severe stenosis (\u2265\u200940% of lumen) and the remaining group. Immunohistochemistry detected EGFR and MMP-9 in 24 of 31 shunts, located mainly in the luminal area. Cross-sectional area of EGFR and MMP-9 measured in median 0.19 mm<sup>2</sup> (IQR 0.1-0.3 mm<sup>2</sup>) and 0.04 mm<sup>2</sup> (IQR 0.03-0.09 mm<sup>2</sup>), respectively, and correlated positively with the area of neointimal measured on histology (r\u2009=\u20090.729, p\u2009<\u20090.001 and r\u2009=\u20090.0479, p\u2009=\u20090.018, respectively). There was a trend of inverse correlation between the dose of acetylsalicylic acid and the degree of EGFR, but not MMP-9, expression within neointima. Certain alleles in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) were associated with increased stenosis and neointimal hyperplasia within shunts. EGFR and MMP-9 contribute to neointimal proliferation in SP shunts of children with complex cyanotic heart disease. SP shunts from patients carrying certain risk alleles in the genes encoding for EGF and TIMP-1 displayed increased neointima.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36863641\nTitle: Mechanism of the Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile basic formula in improving postoperative cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting apoptosis through the SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway.\nAbstract: The Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile is a commonly used Mongolian in folk medicine used to treat cerebral nervous system diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, nerve injury and cognitive function, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and coronary heart disease. Eerdun wurile may effect anti-postoperative cognitive function. To investigate the molecular mechanism of the Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile Basic Formula (EWB) in improving postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) based on Network pharmacology, and to confirm involvement of the SIRT1/p53 signal pathway, one of the key signal pathways, by using the POCD mouse model. Obtain compounds and disease-related targets through TCMSP, TCMID, PubChem, PharmMapper platforms, GeneCards, and OMIM databases, and screen intersection genes; Use Cytoscape software to build a \"drug-ingredient-disease-target\" network, and the STRING platform for protein interaction analysis.; R software was used to analyze the function of gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment.; AutoDock Vina software for active components and core targets to Perform molecular docking. The POCD mouse model was prepared by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the morphological changes of hippocampal tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Western blot, immunofluorescence and TUNEL were used to verify the results of network pharmacological enrichment analysis. There were 110 potential targets for improving POCD by EWB, 117 items were enriched by GO, and 113 pathways were enriched by KEGG, among which the SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway was related to the occurrence of POCD. Quercetin, kaempferol, vestitol, \u03b2-sitosterol and 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone in EWB can form stable conformations with low binding energy with core target proteins IL-6, CASP3, VEGFA, EGFR and ESR1. Animal experiments showed that compared with the POCD model group, the EWB group could significantly improve the apoptosis in the hippocampus of the mice, and significantly down-regulate the expression of Acetyl-p53 protein (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). EWB can improve POCD with the characteristics of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway synergistic effects. Studies have confirmed that EWB can improve the occurrence of POCD by regulating the expression of genes related to the SIRT1/p53 signal pathway, which provides a new target and basis for the treatment of POCD.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36795511\nTitle: EGFR inhibition leads to enhanced desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion via ROCK activation.\nAbstract: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a familial heart disease partly caused by impaired desmosome turnover. Thus, stabilization of desmosome integrity may provide new treatment options. Desmosomes, apart from cellular cohesion, provide the structural framework of a signaling hub. Here, we investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cardiomyocyte cohesion. We inhibited EGFR under physiological and pathophysiological conditions using the murine plakoglobin-KO AC model, in which EGFR was upregulated. EGFR inhibition enhanced cardiomyocyte cohesion. Immunoprecipitation showed an interaction of EGFR and desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Immunostaining and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed enhanced DSG2 localization and binding at cell borders upon EGFR inhibition. Enhanced area composita length and desmosome assembly were observed upon EGFR inhibition, confirmed by enhanced DSG2 and desmoplakin (DP) recruitment to cell borders. PamGene Kinase assay performed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes treated with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, revealed upregulation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Erlotinib-mediated desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion were abolished upon ROCK inhibition. Thus, inhibiting EGFR and, thereby, stabilizing desmosome integrity via ROCK might provide treatment options for AC.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36756695\nTitle: BASP1 promotes high glucose-induced endothelial apoptosis in diabetes via activation of EGFR signaling.\nAbstract: Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease of glucose metabolism. Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to reveal the expression of BASP1 and its biological roles in endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. By analyzing the databases related to diabetes complicated with coronary heart disease, BASP1 was screened out as an upregulated gene. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary mouse aortic endothelial cells were treated with high glucose to establish cell models of diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction, and the expression changes of BASP1 were verified by RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. BASP1 was silenced or overexpressed by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, and its effects on cell migration, apoptosis, tube formation, inflammatory response, and ROS were detected. The possible signaling pathway of BASP1 was found and the mechanism of BASP1 on promoting the progression of endothelial dysfunction was explored using the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the expression of BASP1 in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant coronary heart disease was increased. High glucose induced the upregulation of BASP1 expression in endothelial cells, and showed a time-dependent relationship. Silencing of BASP1 alleviated the damage of high glucose to endothelial cells. BASP1 regulated EGFR positively. The promoting effect of BASP1 on endothelial cell apoptosis may be achieved by regulating the EGFR pathway. BASP1 promotes endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose in patients with diabetes, which may be activated by activating the EGFR pathway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n.PMID: 22285168\nTitle: Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EURTAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.\nAbstract: Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC. We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending \u2265 6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (\u2265 1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225. Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9\u00b77 months (95% CI 8\u00b74-12\u00b73) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5\u00b72 months (4\u00b75-5\u00b78) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b754; p < 0\u00b70001). Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22%]), anaemia (one [1%] vs three [4%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2%] vs 0). Five (6%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20%) on chemotherapy. One patient in the erlotinib group and two in the standard chemotherapy group died from treatment-related causes. Our findings strengthen the rationale for routine baseline tissue-based assessment of EGFR mutations in patients with NSCLC and for treatment of mutation-positive patients with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

A novel series of pyrrolidine-carboxamide derivatives 7a-q were developed and examined in a cell viability assay utilizing a human mammary gland epithelial cell line (MCF-10A), where all the compounds exhibited no cytotoxic effects and more than 85% cell viability at a concentration of 50\u2009\u03bcM. Antiproliferative activity was evaluated in\u00a0vitro against four panels of cancer cell lines A-549, MCF-7, Panc-1, and HT-29. Compounds 7e, 7g, 7k, 7n, and 7o were the most active as antiproliferative agents capable of triggering apoptosis. Compound 7g was the most potent of all the derivatives, with a mean IC<sub>50</sub> of\u00a00.90\u2009\u03bcM compared to IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.10\u2009\u03bcM for doxorubicin. Compound 7g inhibited A-549 (epithelial cancer cell line), MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), and HT-29 (colon cancer cell line) more efficiently than doxorubicin. EGFR inhibitory assay results of 7e, 7g, 7k, 7n, and 7o demonstrated that the tested compounds inhibited EGFR with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 87 to 107\u2009nM in comparison with the reference drug erlotinib (IC<sub>50</sub> \u2009=\u200980\u2009nM). 7e, 7g, 7k, 7n, and 7o inhibited CDK2 efficiently in comparison to the reference dinaciclib (IC<sub>50</sub> \u2009=\u200920\u2009nM), with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 15 to 31\u2009nM. The results of inhibitory activity assay against different CDK isoforms revealed that the tested compounds had preferential inhibitory activity against the CDK2 isoform.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 17463250\nTitle: MET amplification leads to gefitinib resistance in lung cancer by activating ERBB3 signaling.\nAbstract: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)-dependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 38216948\nTitle: Differential efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors according to the types of EGFR mutations and agents in non-small cell lung cancer: a real-world study.\nAbstract: Both first and second-generation EGFR-TKIs are recommended in advanced NSCLC with common EGFR mutations. However, there are few data on the difference in efficacy of EGFR-TKIs based on the type of EGFR mutation and agents. This retrospective real-world study evaluated the outcomes and clinicopathologic characteristics, including the type of EGFR mutations, of 237 advanced NSCLC patients treated with first- or second-generation (afatinib) EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of all patients were 11 months (M) and 25M, respectively. In the univariate analysis, patients with exon 19 deletion (del) (n=130) had significantly longer median OS compared to those with other mutations (L858R: 84, others: 23) (30 vs. 22 M, p=0.047), without a difference in PFS (p=0.138). Patients treated with afatinib (n=60) showed significantly longer median OS compared to those treated with first-generation TKIs (gefitinib: 159, erlotinib: 18) (30 vs. 23 M, p=0.037), without a difference in PFS (p=0.179). In patients with exon 19 del, there was no significant difference in median PFS (p=0.868) or OS (p=0.361) between patients treated with afatinib and those treated with first-generation TKIs, while significantly better PFS (p=0.042) and trend in OS (p=0.069) were observed in patients receiving afatinib in other mutations. Exon 19 del was independently associated with favorable OS (p=0.028), while age >70 years (p=0.017), ECOG performance status \u22652 (p=0.001), primary metastatic disease (p=0.007), and synchronous brain metastasis (p=0.026) were independent prognostic factors of poor OS. The EGFR exon 19 del was associated with favorable OS in advanced NSCLC patients receiving first-line EGFR-TKIs. Moreover, in patients with exon 19 del, first-generation TKIs seem to be a reasonable treatment option if osimertinib is unavailable.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 15329413\nTitle: EGF receptor gene mutations are common in lung cancers from \"never smokers\" and are associated with sensitivity of tumors to gefitinib and erlotinib.\nAbstract: Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. In-frame deletions occur in exon 19, whereas point mutations occur frequently in codon 858 (exon 21). We found from sequencing the EGFR TK domain that 7 of 10 gefitinib-sensitive tumors had similar types of alterations; no mutations were found in eight gefitinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.004). Five of seven tumors sensitive to erlotinib (Tarceva), a related kinase inhibitor for which the clinically relevant target is undocumented, had analogous somatic mutations, as opposed to none of 10 erlotinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.003). Because most mutation-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas from patients who smoked <100 cigarettes in a lifetime (\"never smokers\"), we screened EGFR exons 2-28 in 15 adenocarcinomas resected from untreated never smokers. Seven tumors had TK domain mutations, in contrast to 4 of 81 non-small cell lung cancers resected from untreated former or current smokers (P = 0.0001). Immunoblotting of lysates from cells transiently transfected with various EGFR constructs demonstrated that, compared to wild-type protein, an exon 19 deletion mutant induced diminished levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine 1092 of an exon 21 point mutant was inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of drug. Collectively, these data show that adenocarcinomas from never smokers comprise a distinct subset of lung cancers, frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between heart disease and erlotinib through their own interactions with EGFR.

Thirty-seven patients (RASB group) using RASBs during systemic treatment were compared with 80 controls (control group) who did not use RASBs following the diagnosis of NSCLC. The histological tumor subtype, performance status, age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, other medications, chemotherapeutics (CT), and erlotinib that were received in any line of treatment were recorded. We compared the OS of the patients in the RASB and control groups.The median (\u00b1SD) age of the patients was 61 (\u00b11) years and all patients were administered systemic treatment (CT or erlotinib). The patients in RASB group were more likely to be smokers, have hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and use erlotinib, thiazides, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers (P\u200a<\u200a0.05 for all) compared with the control group. The median follow-up time was 18.9 months (range 1-102 months) for the entire group. The median follow-up period was longer for RASB group than control group (17 vs 11 months, P\u200a=\u200a0.033). The most commonly prescribed RASB agent was valsartan (n\u200a=\u200a12/37). At the time of the analysis, 98 (83.7%) of all patients had died. In the univariate analysis, the median OS was longer in the RASB group compared with the control group (17 [\u00b14.1] vs 12 [\u00b11.4] months, P\u200a=\u200a0.016). Interestingly, further analyses revealed that RASBs significantly improved OS only if used with erlotinib concurrently (34 [\u00b113.8] vs 25 [\u00b15] months, P\u200a=\u200a0.002) and the OS benefit was more attributable to ARBs because only 4 patients received ACEI and erlotinib concurrently. However, the benefit of ARBs on OS disappeared in the multivariate analysis.The use of ARBs during erlotinib treatment may prolong OS of patients with metastatic NSCLC.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36795511\nTitle: EGFR inhibition leads to enhanced desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion via ROCK activation.\nAbstract: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a familial heart disease partly caused by impaired desmosome turnover. Thus, stabilization of desmosome integrity may provide new treatment options. Desmosomes, apart from cellular cohesion, provide the structural framework of a signaling hub. Here, we investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cardiomyocyte cohesion. We inhibited EGFR under physiological and pathophysiological conditions using the murine plakoglobin-KO AC model, in which EGFR was upregulated. EGFR inhibition enhanced cardiomyocyte cohesion. Immunoprecipitation showed an interaction of EGFR and desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Immunostaining and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed enhanced DSG2 localization and binding at cell borders upon EGFR inhibition. Enhanced area composita length and desmosome assembly were observed upon EGFR inhibition, confirmed by enhanced DSG2 and desmoplakin (DP) recruitment to cell borders. PamGene Kinase assay performed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes treated with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, revealed upregulation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Erlotinib-mediated desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion were abolished upon ROCK inhibition. Thus, inhibiting EGFR and, thereby, stabilizing desmosome integrity via ROCK might provide treatment options for AC.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n. PMID: 23660125\nTitle: Effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on rat isolated heart function and protein biomarkers indicative of toxicity.\nAbstract: Cardiac toxicity, manifested as diminished contractility, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure is a major issue in drug safety. Concerns revolve around targeted drugs (TKIs) where contractility effects were not anticipated. The ability to predict cardiac toxicity early would help to de-risk drugs in development and prepare physicians to manage risk in the clinic. Issues with current preclinical studies include insufficient testing with informative, translatable models, and predictive biomarkers. The isolated heart model is amenable to multiple assessments which can be combined with current technologies to assess toxicity on a multi-scale level. Rat isolated heart model was used to assess changes in left ventricular (LV) contractility and protein biomarkers BNP, IL6, TNF\u03b1, and cardiac troponins T (TnT) and I (TnI). Responses were assessed during perfusion with modified Henseleit Krebs (MHK), and 20 min concentration escalations of verapamil, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), isoproterenol, or 20 min escalations bracketing clinical blood concentrations of sunitinib, sorafenib, and erlotinib. LV parameters and effluent for biomarkers were collected before and during escalating drug concentrations. Verapamil reduced inotropy with no change in biomarkers, FCCP and isoproterenol reduced and increased heart function respectively and increased TnT and TNF\u03b1. Erlotinib had no significant effects on function or biomarkers. Sunitinib diminished function, increased TNF\u03b1 at 0.1 \u03bcM, and increased TnT at higher concentrations. Sorafenib dose dependently increased TNF\u03b1 beginning at 0.1 \u03bcM, reducing contractility and flow rate at 0.6 \u03bcM. The ex-vivo assay is a sensitive and predictive model for assessing changes in heart function and biomarkers of toxicity and injury. This assay demonstrates the potential for sunitinib and sorafenib to cause cardiac toxicity in humans. Also, TNF\u03b1 appears to be a biomarker in the heart prior to injury. Due to its versatility, the isolated heart assay has potential to fill gaps in cardiac safety testing early in drug development.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 34919300\nTitle: Eyelash trichomegaly: a systematic review of acquired and congenital aetiologies of lengthened lashes.\nAbstract: Long eyelashes have been popularized and many commercially available products exist to achieve eyelash growth as a desired cosmetic effect. Eyelash trichomegaly may be induced by medications, procedures, or be related to medical conditions; however, the exact mechanisms that govern eyelash growth are not well elucidated. This study aims to identify and summarize aetiologies associated with eyelash trichomegaly. We report a systematic review of 148 clinical trials, prospective and retrospective studies, and case reports describing all evidence-based potential aetiologies of eyelash trichomegaly obtained from the Medline/PubMed and Cochrane Library through January 2021. Inclusion criteria were defined as (i) human studies involving congenital and acquired diseases in which eyelash trichomegaly is a characteristic or (ii) assessment of trichomegaly as an adverse or desired effect of a medication or procedure. Exclusion criteria included: animal studies, articles not available in English, outcomes unrelated to eyelash trichomegaly, and secondary review articles. Pharmacologic agents associated with eyelash trichomegaly included prostaglandin analogues (15-keto fluprostenol isopropyl ester, bimatoprost, latanoprost, and travoprost), epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib, and panitumumab), interferon-alpha, and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine). Surgical procedures of the eyelid, as well as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, HIV, ichthyosis vulgaris (IV), uveitis, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis were also associated with increased eyelash growth. Congenital disorders associated with lengthened eyelashes included Cant\u00fa syndrome, CHOPS syndrome, Coffin-Siris syndrome, congenital heart disease, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Costello syndrome, familial trichomegaly, Floating Harbor syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Kabuki-Makeup syndrome, KBG syndrome, Oliver-McFarlane syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. While the most common cause of eyelash trichomegaly is topical bimatoprost use, better understanding of pathways implicated in eyelash trichomegaly may lead to the discovery of additional medications to stimulate eyelash growth and create avenues for future therapeutic interventions.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 25815472\nTitle: Cardiovascular toxicity of multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced solid tumors: a population-based observational study.\nAbstract: Treatment with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved survival in many cancers, yet has been associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Warnings of cardiovascular events are common in drug labels of many TKIs. Despite these warnings, cardiovascular toxicity of patients treated with TKIs remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes of advanced cancer patients treated with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A population based cohort study was undertaken involving adults aged >18 years in Ontario, Canada, diagnosed with any advanced malignancy between 2006 and 2012. Data were extracted from linked administrative governmental databases. Adults with advanced cancer receiving TKIs were identified and followed throughout the time period. The main outcomes of interest were rates of hospitalization for ischemic heart disease (acute myocardial infarction and angina) or cerebrovascular accidents and death. 1642 patients with a mean age of 62.5 years were studied; 1046 were treated with erlotinib, 166 with sorafenib and 430 with sunitinib. Over the 380 day median follow-up period (range 6-1970 days), 1.1% of all patients had ischemic heart events, 0.7% had cerebrovascular accidents and 72.1% died. Rates of cardiovascular events were similar to age and gender-matched individuals without cancer. In a subgroup analysis of treatment patients with a prior history of ischemic heart disease, 3.3% had ischemic heart events while 1.2% had cerebrovascular accidents. TKIs do not appear to increase the cause-specific hazard of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular accidents compared to age and gender-matched individuals without advanced cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: erlotinib treats heart disease., which posits an interaction between heart disease and erlotinib.
