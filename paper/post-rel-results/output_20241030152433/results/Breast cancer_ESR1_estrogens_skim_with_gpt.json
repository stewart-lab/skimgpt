Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, we enrolled 11 patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-exome and transcriptome analysis showed that six cases harbored mutations of ESR1 affecting its ligand-binding domain (LBD), all of whom had been treated with anti-estrogens and estrogen deprivation therapies. A survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified four endometrial cancers with similar mutations of ESR1. The five new LBD-localized ESR1 mutations identified here (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Cys, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly) were shown to result in constitutive activity and continued responsiveness to anti-estrogen therapies in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that activating mutations in ESR1 are a key mechanism in acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer therapy.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 38236307\nTitle: Differential DNA methylation and CTCF binding between the ESR1 promoter a of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.\nAbstract: ESR1 is expressed by 60-70% of breast tumours. it's a good prognosis factor and the target of hormone therapy. Optimization of ESR1 reactivation therapy is currently ongoing. Here we probe if the transcription factor CTCF plays a role in the differential expression of ESR1 in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ESR1+) and MDA-MB-231 (ESR1-). Knockdown of CTCF in MCF-7 resulted in decreased ESR1 gene expression. CTCF binds to the promoter of ESR1 in MCF-7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. CTCF ESR1 binding sites are unmethylated in MCF7 but methylated in MDA-MB-231 cells. ESR1 expression in MCF7 cells is dependent on CTCF expression. CTCF can bind to specific regions of the promotor of ESR1 gene in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells, this correlates with the methylation status of these regions and could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of ESR1.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 24185512\nTitle: ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations in hormone-resistant breast cancer.\nAbstract: Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 38231165\nTitle: Incongruity between T cell receptor recognition of breast cancer hotspot mutations ESR1 Y537S and D538G following exogenous peptide loading versus endogenous antigen processing.\nAbstract: T cell receptor engineered T cell (TCR T) therapies have shown recent efficacy against certain types of solid metastatic cancers. However, to extend TCR T therapies to treat more patients across additional cancer types, new TCRs recognizing cancer-specific antigen targets are needed. Driver mutations in AKT1, ESR1, PIK3CA, and TP53 are common in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and if immunogenic could serve as ideal tumor-specific targets for TCR T therapy to treat this disease. Through IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot screening of in vitro expanded neopeptide-stimulated T cell lines from healthy donors and MBC patients, we identified reactivity towards 11 of 13 of the mutations. To identify neopeptide-specific TCRs, we then performed single-cell RNA sequencing of one of the T cell lines following neopeptide stimulation. Here, we identified an ESR1 Y537S specific T cell clone, clonotype 16, and an ESR1 Y537S/D538G dual-specific T cell clone, clonotype 21, which were HLA-B*40:02 and HLA-C*01:02 restricted, respectively. TCR Ts expressing these TCRs recognized and killed target cells pulsed with ESR1 neopeptides with minimal activity against ESR1 WT peptide. However, these TCRs failed to recognize target cells expressing endogenous mutant ESR1. To investigate the basis of this lack of recognition we performed immunopeptidomics analysis of a mutant-overexpressing lymphoblastoid cell line and found that the ESR1 Y537S neopeptide was not endogenously processed, despite binding to HLA-B*40:02 when exogenously pulsed onto the target cell. These results indicate that stimulation of T cells that likely derive from the na\u00efve repertoire with pulsed minimal peptides may lead to the expansion of clones that recognize non-processed peptides, and highlights the importance of using methods that selectively expand T cells with specificity for antigens that are efficiently processed and presented.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 25013076\nTitle: Cancer therapy. Ex vivo culture of circulating breast tumor cells for individualized testing of drug susceptibility.\nAbstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are present at low concentrations in the peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors. It has been proposed that the isolation, ex vivo culture, and characterization of CTCs may provide an opportunity to noninvasively monitor the changing patterns of drug susceptibility in individual patients as their tumors acquire new mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we established CTC cultures from six patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Three of five CTC lines tested were tumorigenic in mice. Genome sequencing of the CTC lines revealed preexisting mutations in the PIK3CA gene and newly acquired mutations in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1), PIK3CA gene, and fibroblast growth factor receptor gene (FGFR2), among others. Drug sensitivity testing of CTC lines with multiple mutations revealed potential new therapeutic targets. With optimization of CTC culture conditions, this strategy may help identify the best therapies for individual cancer patients over the course of their disease.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===PMID: 24185510\nTitle: Activating ESR1 mutations in hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer.\nAbstract: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, and over two-thirds of cases express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1, encoded by ESR1).

Endocrine therapy (ET) represents the standard treatment for HR\u2009+\u2009BC. Most patients, however, eventually develop resistance to ET, which limits their effectiveness and poses a major challenge for the management of HR\u2009+\u2009BC. Several mechanisms that contribute to ET resistance have been described. One of the most common mechanisms is the upregulation of alternative signaling pathways that can bypass estrogen dependency, such as activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathways. Another common mechanism of endocrine resistance is the acquisition of activating mutations of ESR1, which encodes for the estrogen receptor, that lead to structural changes of the receptor, prevent the binding to anti-estrogen drugs and result in constitutive activation of the receptor, even in the absence of estrogens. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can also contribute to ET resistance by altering the expression of genes that are involved in estrogen signaling. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to ET is crucial for the development of new therapies that can overcome resistance and improve outcomes for patients with HR\u2009+\u2009BC.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 15213208\nTitle: Estrogen receptor alpha gene polymorphisms and risk of myocardial infarction.\nAbstract: The role of estrogens in ischemic heart disease (IHD) is uncertain. Evidence suggests that genetic variations in the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene may influence IHD risk, but the role of common sequence variations in the ESR1 gene is unclear. To determine whether the ESR1 haplotype created by the c.454-397T>C (PvuII) and c.454-351A>G (XbaI) polymorphisms is associated with myocardial infarction (MI) and IHD risk. In 2617 men and 3791 postmenopausal women from The Rotterdam Study (enrollment between 1989-1993 and follow-up to January 2000), a population-based, prospective cohort study of participants aged 55 years and older, ESR1 c.454-397T>C and c.454-351A>G haplotypes were determined. Detailed interviews and physical examinations were performed, blood samples were obtained, and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed. The primary outcome was MI and IHD defined as MIs, revascularization procedures, and IHD mortality. Approximately 29% of women and 28.2% of men were homozygous carriers of the ESR1 haplotype 1 (-397 T and -351 A) allele, 49% of women and 50% of men were heterozygous carriers, and 22% of women and 21.4% of men were noncarriers. During a mean follow-up of 7.0 years, 285 participants (115 women; 170 men) had MI, and 440 (168 women; 272 men) had an IHD event, of which 97 were fatal. After adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors, female heterozygous carriers of haplotype 1 had an increased risk of MI (event rate, 2.8%; relative risk [RR], 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-4.43) compared with noncarriers (event rate, 1.3%), whereas homozygous carriers had an increased risk (event rate, 3.2%; RR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.22-5.03). For IHD events, we observed a similar association. In women, the effect of haplotype 1 on fatal IHD was larger than on nonfatal IHD. In men, the ESR1 haplotypes were not associated with an increased risk of MI (event rate, 5.7%; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.59-1.46 for heterozygous carriers; and event rate, 5.1%; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.49-1.38 for homozygous carriers) compared with noncarriers (event rate, 5.8%) and were not associated with an increased risk of IHD. In this population-based, prospective cohort study, postmenopausal women who carry ESR1 haplotype 1 (c.454-397 T allele and c.454-351 A allele) have an increased risk of MI and IHD, independent of known cardiovascular risk factors. In men, no association was observed.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37516793\nTitle: The role of mesenchymal estrogen receptor 1 in mouse uterus in response to estrogen.\nAbstract: Estrogens play important roles in uterine growth and homeostasis through estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2). To address the role of ESR1-mediated tissue events in the murine uterus, we analyzed mice with a mesenchymal tissue-specific knockout of Esr1. Isl1-driven Cre expression generated Esr1 deletion in the uterine stroma and endometrium (Isl-Esr1KO). We showed that overall structure of the Isl1-Esr1KO mouse uterus developed normally, but estrogen responsiveness and subsequent growth were defective, suggesting that mesenchymal ESR1 is necessary for both epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed that the majority of estrogen-induced genes were regulated by stromal ESR1. In control mice, E2 administration induced 9476 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), whereas only 1801 up-regulated DEGs were induced by E2 in Isl1-Esr1KO mice. We further showed that stromal ESR1-regulated genes in the mouse uterus included several growth factors and cytokines, which are potential factors that regulate epithelial and stromal tissue interaction, and also genes involved in lipid homeostasis. Therefore, we infer that stromal ESR1 expression is indispensable for most estrogen actions in the mouse uterus and the current results provide new insights into estrogen-mediated homeostasis in female reproductive organs.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 28539434\nTitle: Estrogens in Male Physiology.\nAbstract: Estrogens have historically been associated with female reproduction, but work over the last two decades established that estrogens and their main nuclear receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) also regulate male reproductive and nonreproductive organs. 17\u03b2-Estradiol (E2) is measureable in blood of men and males of other species, but in rete testis fluids, E2 reaches concentrations normally found only in females and in some species nanomolar concentrations of estrone sulfate are found in semen. Aromatase, which converts androgens to estrogens, is expressed in Leydig cells, seminiferous epithelium, and other male organs. Early studies showed E2 binding in numerous male tissues, and ESR1 and ESR2 each show unique distributions and actions in males. Exogenous estrogen treatment produced male reproductive pathologies in laboratory animals and men, especially during development, and studies with transgenic mice with compromised estrogen signaling demonstrated an E2 role in normal male physiology. Efferent ductules and epididymal functions are dependent on estrogen signaling through ESR1, whose loss impaired ion transport and water reabsorption, resulting in abnormal sperm. Loss of ESR1 or aromatase also produces effects on nonreproductive targets such as brain, adipose, skeletal muscle, bone, cardiovascular, and immune tissues. Expression of GPER is extensive in male tracts, suggesting a possible role for E2 signaling through this receptor in male reproduction. Recent evidence also indicates that membrane ESR1 has critical roles in male reproduction. Thus estrogens are important physiological regulators in males, and future studies may reveal additional roles for estrogen signaling in various target tissues.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between Breast cancer and estrogens through their own interactions with ESR1.
