            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 10929917\nTitle: Pharmacology of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-induced mitochondrial toxicity.\nAbstract: This paper reviews the function of the mitochondria and the mechanisms by which nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause mitochondrial toxicity. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces rates of morbidity and mortality due to HIV disease. However, long-term treatment with these drugs may be associated with adverse effects. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and have become the cornerstone of HAART. Unfortunately, these drugs have also been shown to inhibit cellular polymerases, most notably mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Studies of the NRTIs in enzyme assays and cell cultures demonstrate the following hierarchy of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma inhibition: zalcitabine > didanosine > stavudine > lamivudine > zidovudine > abacavir. In vitro investigations have also documented impairment of the mitochondrial enzymes adenylate kinase and the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate translocator. Inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma and other mitochondrial enzymes can gradually lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular toxicity. The clinical manifestations of NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity resemble those of inherited mitochondrial diseases (ie, hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, myopathy, nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis). Fat redistribution syndrome, or HIV-associated lipodystrophy, is another side effect attributed in part to NRTI therapy. The morphologic and metabolic complications of this syndrome are similar to those of the mitochondrial disorder known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis: suggesting that this too may be related to mitochondrial toxicity. The pathophysiology of less common adverse effects of nucleoside analogue therapy, such as diabetes, ototoxicity, and retinal lesions, may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction but have not been adequately studied. NRTls can block both HIV reverse transcriptase and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Inhibition of the latter enzyme is the most likely cause of the adverse effects associated with these drugs.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37477514\nTitle: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Liver Fibrosis as Predictors of New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus in People With HIV: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.\nAbstract: We investigated the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) plus or minus a concurrent diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and the risk factors associated with NAFLD or NASH development. In this prospective study, we analyzed people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PWH) aged \u226518 years without excessive alcohol consumption or hepatitis coinfections. NAFLD was defined as controlled attenuation parameter \u2265248 dB/m, whereas NASH with significant disease activity and liver fibrosis was defined as a FibroScan-AST score \u22650.67. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to investigate the association between NAFLD with or without NASH and new-onset DM. Of 847 PWH, the median age at baseline was 45 years (interquartile range, 38-51; 43% female). Baseline NAFLD was associated with 2.8-fold higher risk of new-onset DM after adjusting for age, sex, family history of DM, antiretroviral therapy duration, smoking, statin use, stavudine/didanosine/zidovudine exposure, time-updated body mass index, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Combined NAFLD and NASH at baseline had 3.1-fold higher new-onset DM risk. In separate analyses, baseline DM did not predict progression to NAFLD or NASH, but tenofovir alafenamide use was associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-4.02) or NASH development (2.31; 95% CI, 1.12-5.11). NAFLD alone or combined with NASH strongly predicts new-onset DM. This highlights the need for systematic risk assessments and management of NAFLD/NASH, as it may contribute to metabolic complications such as DM and subsequent cardiovascular diseases in PWH.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 18268071\nTitle: Incidence and risk factors for new-onset diabetes in HIV-infected patients: the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study.\nAbstract: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of diabetes among HIV-infected patients in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) cohort, to identify demographic, HIV-related, and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-related factors associated with the onset of diabetes, and to identify possible mechanisms for any relationships found. D:A:D is a prospective observational study of 33,389 HIV-infected patients; diabetes is a study end point. Poisson regression models were used to assess the relation between diabetes and exposure to cART after adjusting for known risk factors for diabetes, CD4 count, lipids, and lipodystrophy. Over 130,151 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), diabetes was diagnosed in 744 patients (incidence rate of 5.72 per 1,000 PYFU [95% CI 5.31-6.13]). The incidence of diabetes increased with cumulative exposure to cART, an association that remained significant after adjustment for potential risk factors for diabetes. The strongest relationship with diabetes was exposure to stavudine; exposures to zidovudine and didanosine were also associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Time-updated measurements of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were all associated with diabetes. Adjusting for each of these variables separately reduced the relationship between cART and diabetes slightly. Although lipodystrophy was significantly associated with diabetes, adjustment for this did not modify the relationship between cART and diabetes. Stavudine and zidovudine are significantly associated with diabetes after adjustment for risk factors for diabetes and lipids. Adjustment for lipodystrophy did not modify the relationship, suggesting that the two thymidine analogs probably directly contribute to insulin resistance, potentially through mitochondrial toxicity.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36800379\nTitle: Prevalence and incidence of hypertension in a heavily treatment-experienced cohort of people living with HIV in Uganda.\nAbstract: The effect of long-term exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) on hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of hypertension in people living with HIV (PLWH) with more than 10 years of ART in Uganda. The analysis was performed within a cohort of adult PLWH with more than 10 years of ART at an HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Participants were eligible for this analysis if they had \u22652 follow-up visits. Hypertension was defined as two consecutive systolic blood pressure (SBP) measures greater than 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg, and/or documented diagnosis and/or the initiation of antihypertensives. We determined the proportion of PLWH with hypertension at baseline and used multivariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with prevalent hypertension. To determine the incidence of hypertension, follow-up began from the cohort baseline date and was censored at the last clinic visit or date of the event, whichever occurred earlier. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to determine the adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) of hypertension according to demographic, ART, and clinical characteristics. Of the 1000 ALT participants, 970 (97%) had \u22652 follow-up visits, and 237 (24.4%) had hypertension at baseline. The odds of prevalent hypertension were 1.18 for every 5-year increase in age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.34) and were higher among males (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.20-2.34), participants with diabetes mellitus (aOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.10-4.01), obesity (aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.08-3.60), high cholesterol (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.16-2.01), and those with prior exposure to stavudine (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.35-3.52), or nevirapine (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.25-3.01). Of the 733 participants without hypertension at baseline, 116 (15.83%) developed hypertension during 4671.3 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 24.8 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 20.7-29.8). The factors associated with incident hypertension were obesity (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.40-2.81), older age (aIRR 1.12 per 5-year increase in age, 95% CI 1.10,1.25), and renal insufficiency (aIRR1.80, 95% CI 1.40-2.81). The prevalence and incidence of hypertension were high in this heavily treated PLWH cohort. Therefore, with increasing ART coverage, HIV programs in SSA should strengthen the screening for hypertension in heavily treated PLWH.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n. PMID: 16103768\nTitle: Cumulative exposure to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors is associated with insulin resistance markers in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.\nAbstract: To estimate insulin resistance and its relationship to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of HIV-infected persons with comparison to HIV-seronegative controls. Prospective cohort of 533 HIV-infected and 755 HIV-seronegative men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study evaluated at 6-month intervals between 1999 and 2003. Recent ART exposure was assessed by type of treatment in the preceding 6 months [i.e., no ART, monotherapy, combination ART, or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with and without a protease inhibitor (PI)]. Cumulative exposure was determined for the three major ART classes and for individual medications within each class. Two endpoints, a modified QUICKI index, 100 x 1/[log10(glucose) + log10(insulin)] and fasting hyperinsulinemia (insulin > 15 microU/ml), were assessed. All statistical models were adjusted for age, body mass index, race, nadir CD4 cell count, hepatitis C serostatus and family history of diabetes mellitus. Each of the HIV-infected groups had higher odds of hyperinsulinemia and lower mean QUICKI than the HIV-seronegative men. Each additional year of exposure to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) was associated with increased odds of hyperinsulinemia [odds ratio (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.13) and a lower QUICKI (-0.04; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01). Cumulative exposure to non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors or PI drugs was not associated with either insulin resistance marker. Of individual medications examined, stavudine was associated with the highest risk of hyperinsulinemia (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.2-1.3). Fasting surrogate markers suggest increased insulin resistance in HIV-infected men, which is related to cumulative NRTI exposure.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: stavudine treats diabetes., which posits an interaction between diabetes and stavudine.
