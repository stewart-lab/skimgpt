                "Score: **+1** Point(s) - Reasoning:\n\nThe hypothesis proposes that pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through its effect on ULK1. Let's analyze the abstracts to assess the interactions between NAFLD-ULK1 and ULK1-pp242 and determine if they support the hypothesis.\n\n**1. NAFLD and ULK1 Interaction:**\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 23978414** reports that resveratrol improves NAFLD in mice, and *partial inhibition of ULK1 impairs these ameliorative effects*. This suggests that **ULK1 activity is beneficial** in treating NAFLD.\n  \n- **Abstract PMID: 32042044** states that in NAFLD patients, hepatic expression of **ULK1 is substantially decreased**. This implies that reduced ULK1 is associated with NAFLD, and restoring ULK1 levels may be beneficial.\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 37438882** discusses that **ULK1 stimulates autophagy**, which eliminates fat droplets in NAFLD. Thus, **activation of ULK1-mediated autophagy is beneficial** in improving NAFLD.\n\n**Conclusion from NAFLD-ULK1 Interaction:**\n\n- **Activation of ULK1 is beneficial** in treating NAFLD as it promotes autophagy, reducing hepatic lipid accumulation.\n\n**2. ULK1 and pp242 Interaction:**\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 26636543** shows that pp242, an **ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTORC1/mTORC2**, **suppresses mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser757**. Since mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser757 to inhibit it, **pp242 reduces this inhibitory phosphorylation**, thereby **activating ULK1** and promoting autophagy.\n\n- The same abstract notes that pp242 induces autophagy (specifically mitophagy) but leads to cell death due to impaired autophagic flux. However, the context is in **E1A-Ras transformed cells** (a cancer model), which may respond differently than liver cells in NAFLD.\n\n**Conclusion from ULK1-pp242 Interaction:**\n\n- **pp242 activates ULK1** by inhibiting mTORC1's inhibitory phosphorylation, potentially enhancing autophagy.\n\n**3. Integrated Analysis:**\n\n- Since **ULK1 activation improves NAFLD** and **pp242 activates ULK1** by preventing its inhibitory phosphorylation, it is **logical to infer** that pp242 could **potentially treat NAFLD through ULK1 activation**.\n\n- However, there is **uncertainty** because:\n\n  - The pp242 study demonstrates **cell death in cancer cells** due to impaired autophagic flux. This adverse effect may not occur in hepatocytes during NAFLD treatment, but it's a consideration.\n\n  - **No direct evidence** shows pp242 treating NAFLD in the provided abstracts.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The evidence **suggests a likely positive outcome** where pp242 activates ULK1, which is beneficial in NAFLD through autophagy activation.\n\n- **Uncertainties and contradictions exist**, such as pp242-induced autophagy leading to cell death in certain contexts.\n\n**Assigned Score Based on Guidelines:**\n\n- According to the scoring guidelines:\n\n  - **+1:** The hypothesis is *likely supported* by the evidence, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n\nTherefore, the interactions between NAFLD-ULK1 and ULK1-pp242 **likely support the hypothesis**, but with some reservations due to indirect evidence and potential contradictions."

Wild-type and autophagic mediator ULK1 heterozygous knockout mice were induced to have NAFLD by high-fat diet for 8weeks. After that, resveratrol treatment was applied with the high-fat diet feeding for another 4weeks. Typical features of NAFLD, including histological changes, fibrosis, insulin resistance, oxidative status, and inflammation were characterized. After-treatment with resveratrol showed ameliorative effects on all measured features of NAFLD, from histology, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance to oxidative stress and inflammation. resveratrol treatment also reduced the activity of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) through the restoration of its inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1. Partial inhibition of ULK1 expression impaired the ameliorative effects of resveratrol on hepatic histology, fibrosis, oxidative status, inflammation, and NF-\u03baB activity. In conclusion, resveratrol improved NAFLD-caused hepatic injury partially through regulating autophagic and I\u03baB\u03b1-NF-\u03baB pathways.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37700498\nTitle: Dysfunction of autophagy in high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAbstract: ACOX1: acyl-CoA oxidase 1; ADH5: alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (class III), chi polypeptide; ADIPOQ: adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing; ATG: autophagy related; BECN1: beclin 1; CRTC2: CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; F2RL1: F2R like trypsin receptor 1; FA: fatty acid; FOXO1: forkhead box O1; GLP1R: glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; GRK2: G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2; GTPase: guanosine triphosphatase; HFD: high-fat diet; HSCs: hepatic stellate cells; HTRA2: HtrA serine peptidase 2; IRGM: immunity related GTPase M; KD: knockdown; KDM6B: lysine demethylase 6B; KO: knockout; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; LDs: lipid droplets; Li KO: liver-specific knockout; LSECs: liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAP3K5: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5; MED1: mediator complex subunit 1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; NFE2L2: NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2; NOS3: nitric oxide synthase 3; NR1H3: nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3; OA: oleic acid; OE: overexpression; OSBPL8: oxysterol binding protein like 8; PA: palmitic acid; RUBCNL: rubicon like autophagy enhancer; PLIN2: perilipin 2; PLIN3: perilipin 3; PPARA: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; PRKAA2/AMPK: protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 2; RAB: member RAS oncogene family; RPTOR: regulatory associated protein of MTOR complex 1; SCD: stearoyl-CoA desaturase; SIRT1: sirtuin 1; SIRT3: sirtuin 3; SNARE: soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SREBF1: sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1;SREBF2: sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2; STING1: stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1; STX17: syntaxin 17; TAGs: triacylglycerols; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TP53/p53: tumor protein p53; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; VMP1: vacuole membrane protein 1.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n. PMID: 32042044\nTitle: Fasting-induced FGF21 signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via JMJD3 histone demethylase.\nAbstract: Autophagy is essential for cellular survival and energy homeostasis under nutrient deprivation. Despite the emerging importance of nuclear events in autophagy regulation, epigenetic control of autophagy gene transcription remains unclear. Here, we report fasting-induced Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21) signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via Jumonji-D3 (JMJD3/KDM6B) histone demethylase. Upon FGF21 signaling, JMJD3 epigenetically upregulates global autophagy-network genes, including Tfeb, Atg7, Atgl, and Fgf21, through demethylation of histone H3K27-me3, resulting in autophagy-mediated lipid degradation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of JMJD3 at Thr-1044 by FGF21 signal-activated PKA increases its nuclear localization and interaction with the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b1 to transcriptionally activate autophagy. Administration of FGF21 in obese mice improves defective autophagy and hepatosteatosis in a JMJD3-dependent manner. Remarkably, in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, hepatic expression of JMJD3, ATG7, LC3, and ULK1 is substantially decreased. These findings demonstrate that FGF21-JMJD3 signaling epigenetically links nutrient deprivation with hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation in mammals.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37438882\nTitle: AMPK/mTOR pathway significance in healthy liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its progression.\nAbstract: Obesity is related to several organs, but the liver is particularly affected. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor and regulator of liver lipid dysfunction and glucose metabolism. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase regulating cell growth, survival, metabolism, and immunity. Together, these pathways are involved in obesity, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression, and autophagy. During energy demand, liver kinase B (LKB) phosphorylation helps activate the AMPK/mTOR pathways. Likewise, the protein forkhead box O family (FOXO) negatively regulates adipogenesis by binding to the promoter sites of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha, initiating adipogenesis. In addition, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which regulates de novo lipogenesis, is linked to LKB and FOXO in developing NAFLD. The kinase complex, consisting of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 or 2 (ULK1, ULK2) by stimulating autophagy, and eliminating fat droplets in NAFLD, is regulated by mTORC1 and negatively regulated by AMPK that suppresses liver lipogenesis and increases fatty acid oxidation. Also, ULK1 is essential for initiating phagophore formation, establishing macrophagy, and generating autophagosomes. The selective breakdown of lipid droplets through macroautophagy, or macrolipophagy, occurs on a cellular energy level using free fatty acids. In addition, mTORC1 promotes lipogenesis by activating sterol regulatory element-binding protein. Finding new components and novel regulatory modes in signaling is significant for a better understanding of the AMPK/mTOR pathways, potentially facilitating the development of future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for NAFLD and its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 31551937\nTitle: Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Induced by Perinatal Exposure to Bisphenol a Is Associated With Activated mTOR and TLR4/NF-\u03baB Signaling Pathways in Offspring Rats.\nAbstract: Accumulating evidence suggests a role of bisphenol A (BPA) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of lipogenic genes, but the mechanism of BPA induced lipogenic gene expression remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 \u03bcg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For 5 weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in liver, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased liver lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in liver of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB proteins were also significantly increased, and ER\u03b1 protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathways.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===PMID: 30244168\nTitle: BAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival by activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells.\nAbstract: B cell activating factor from the TNF family (BAFF) is implicated in not only the physiology of normal B cells, but also the pathophysiology of aggressive B cells related to malignant and autoimmune diseases. Autophagy plays a crucial role in balancing the beneficial and detrimental effects of immunity and inflammation. However, little is known about whether and how excessive BAFF mediates autophagy contributing to B-cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that excessive human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF) inhibited autophagy with a concomitant reduction of LC3-II in normal and B-lymphoid (Raji) cells. Knockdown of LC3 not only potentiated hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy, but also attenuated hsBAFF activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby diminishing hsBAFF-induced B-cell proliferation/viability. Further, we found that hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy was Akt/mTOR-dependent. This is supported by the findings that hsBAFF increased mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser757); Akt inhibitor X, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242, expression of dominant negative Akt, or knockdown of mTOR attenuated hsBAFF-induced phosphorylation of ULK1, decrease of LC3-II level, and increase of cell proliferation/viability. Chelating intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) with BAPTA/AM or preventing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation using EGTA or 2-APB profoundly blocked hsBAFF-induced activation of Akt/mTOR, phosphorylation of ULK1 and decrease of LC3-II, as well as increase of cell proliferation/viability. Similar effects were observed in the cells where CaMKII was inhibited by KN93 or knocked down by CaMKII shRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that hsBAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival through activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level or CaMKII, Akt, or mTOR activity to promote autophagy may be exploited for prevention of excessive BAFF-induced aggressive B lymphocyte disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37886951\nTitle: Prior Treatment with AICAR Causes the Selective Phosphorylation of mTOR Substrates in C2C12 Cells.\nAbstract: Metabolic stress in skeletal muscle cells causes sustained metabolic changes, but the mechanisms of the prolonged effects are not fully known. In this study, we tested C2C12 cells with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulator AICAR and measured the changes in the metabolic pathways and signaling kinases. AICAR caused an acute increase in the phosphorylation of the AMPK target ULK1, the mTORC1 substrate S6K, and the mTORC2 target Akt. Intriguingly, prior exposure to AICAR only decreased glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity when it underwent three-hour recovery after exposure to AICAR in a bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (KHB) instead of Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM). The phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target S6K was increased after recovery in DMEM but not KHB, although this appeared to be specific to S6K, as the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target site on ULK1 was not altered when the cells recovered in DMEM. The phosphorylation of mTORC2 target sites was also heterogenous under these conditions, with Akt increasing at serine 473 while other targets (SGK1 and PKC\u03b1) were unaffected. The exposure of cells to rapamycin (an mTORC1 inhibitor) and PP242 (an inhibitor of both mTOR complexes) revealed the differential phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates. Taken together, the data suggest that prior exposure to AICAR causes the selective phosphorylation of mTOR substrates, even after prolonged recovery in a nutrient-replete medium.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n. PMID: 26636543\nTitle: mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242 causes mitophagy terminated by apoptotic cell death in E1A-Ras transformed cells.\nAbstract: mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 target--ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin, pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, short-term pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria, which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles (mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death. Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell--survival or cell death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 29154199\nTitle: Ultraviolet B radiation down-regulates ULK1 and ATG7 expression and impairs the autophagy response in human keratinocytes.\nAbstract: Autophagy is a self-digestive pathway that helps to maintain cellular homeostasis, and many autophagy-related gene (ATG)s involved the regulation of the autophagy process. Ultraviolet light is a common stressor of skin, but it is unclear how autophagy is regulated after ultraviolet exposure in epidermal keratinocytes. Here, we found that the mRNAs of some key ATG genes such as ULK1, ATG5 and ATG7 exhibited significantly lower levels in the skin tissues of the face and chest with solar ultraviolet exposure, compared with perineal skin. Interestingly, UVB radiation down-regulated the expression of ULK1, ATG3 and ATG7, and it inhibited the autophagy flux via a mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR)-independent pathway in human keratinocytes. The inhibition of autophagy in UVB-treated keratinocytes cannot be restored by treatment with the MTOR-dependent autophagy inducer rapamycin. Importantly, UVB treatment perturbs the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II and LC3-II turnover in response to treatment with MTOR inhibitors (Torin 1 and pp242), as well as endoplasmic reticular stress (A23187 and tunicamycin), inositol pathway (L690,330) and autophagy inducers (resveratrol and STF62247). Our study demonstrates that UVB radiation down-regulates several key autophagy-related proteins and impairs the autophagy response in keratinocytes. This study demonstrates a linkage between autophagy and skin disorders associated with ultraviolet exposure.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242 through their own interactions with ULK1.
