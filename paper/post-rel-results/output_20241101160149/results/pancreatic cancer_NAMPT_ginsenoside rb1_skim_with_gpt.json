                "Score: **-2 Points** - Reasoning:\n\nThe hypothesis asserts that **ginsenoside Rb1 treats pancreatic cancer through its effect on NAMPT**. To evaluate this, we need to understand the relationships between pancreatic cancer and NAMPT, and between NAMPT and ginsenoside Rb1, based on the provided abstracts.\n\n1. **Pancreatic Cancer and NAMPT**:\n   - **NAMPT is essential for pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation**.\n     - **PMID: 24025713** reports that **inhibiting NAMPT** reduces NAD levels and metabolic activity in pancreatic cancer cells, leading to decreased cell growth and tumor size. This suggests that NAMPT activity supports pancreatic cancer progression.\n     - **PMID: 37707363** shows that inhibition of NAMPT (using GMX1778) enhances growth inhibition of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, indicating that NAMPT is crucial for cancer cell viability.\n     - **PMID: 27233476** demonstrates that NAMPT is upregulated in PDAC tissues and that its inhibition impairs tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. This further confirms that **NAMPT promotes pancreatic cancer growth**.\n\n2. **NAMPT and Ginsenoside Rb1**:\n   - **Ginsenoside Rb1 increases NAMPT expression and activity**.\n     - **PMID: 38003249** shows that ginsenoside Rb1 **increases the expression of NAMPT** in astrocytes subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. This increase in NAMPT leads to elevated NAD\u207a/NADH ratios and improved cell survival.\n     - **PMID: 36948143** mentions that ginsenoside Rb1, among other natural products, affects NAD\u207a metabolism, potentially via the **NAMPT/NAD\u207a/SIRT pathway**.\n\n3. **Integrating the Interactions**:\n   - Since **ginsenoside Rb1 upregulates NAMPT**, and **NAMPT promotes pancreatic cancer cell survival and growth**, the effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on NAMPT would likely **enhance pancreatic cancer progression**, **not treat it**.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Hypothesis**:\n   - The interactions between the entities **contradict** the hypothesis:\n     - **Activation of NAMPT by ginsenoside Rb1** (as shown in astrocytes) would be **detrimental** in pancreatic cancer since NAMPT supports cancer cell survival.\n     - There is **consistent evidence** across multiple abstracts that inhibiting NAMPT is beneficial for treating pancreatic cancer.\n\n5. **No Contradictory Evidence**:\n   - There is no evidence in the provided abstracts that suggests ginsenoside Rb1 inhibits NAMPT or that its effect on NAMPT leads to pancreatic cancer treatment.\n   - The evidence suggests the opposite\u2014that ginsenoside Rb1 may worsen pancreatic cancer through NAMPT activation.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nAccording to the **scoring guideline for -2 points**:\n\n- **\"-2\": The hypothesis is refuted by consistent evidence indicating that the interactions between pancreatic cancer-NAMPT and/or NAMPT-ginsenoside Rb1 contradict the proposed outcome.**\n\nTherefore, **the hypothesis is refuted by the consistent evidence** showing that ginsenoside Rb1 activates NAMPT, and NAMPT activation promotes pancreatic cancer cell survival and growth. This directly contradicts the hypothesis that ginsenoside Rb1 treats pancreatic cancer through its effect on NAMPT."

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 24025713\nTitle: Targeting of NAD metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells: potential novel therapy for pancreatic tumors.\nAbstract: Here, we describe a novel interplay between NAD synthesis and degradation involved in pancreatic tumor growth. We used human pancreatic cancer cells, both in vitro (cell culture experiments) and in vivo (xenograft experiments), to demonstrate the role of NAD synthesis and degradation in tumor cell metabolism and growth. We demonstrated that pharmacologic and genetic targeting of Nampt, the key enzyme in the NAD salvage synthesis pathway, inhibits cell growth and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These changes were accompanied by a reduction of NAD levels, glycolytic flux, lactate production, mitochondrial function, and levels of ATP. The massive reduction in overall metabolic activity induced by Nampt inhibition was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in pancreatic tumor growth. The results of the mechanistic experiments showed that neither the NAD-dependent enzymes PARP-1 nor SIRT1 play a significant role on the effect of Nampt inhibition on pancreatic cancer cells. However, we identified a role for the NAD degradation pathway mediated by the NADase CD38 on the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. The responsiveness to Nampt inhibition is modulated by the expression of CD38; low levels of this enzyme decrease the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. In contrast, its overexpression decreased cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and further increased the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. Our study demonstrates that NAD metabolism is essential for pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation and that targeting NAD synthesis via the Nampt pathway could lead to novel therapeutic treatments for pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37707363\nTitle: Combined Targeting of NAD Biosynthesis and the NAD-dependent Transcription Factor C-terminal Binding Protein as a Promising Novel Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer.\nAbstract: Cancer therapies targeting metabolic derangements unique to cancer cells are emerging as a key strategy to address refractory solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) that exhibit resistance to extreme nutrient deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) participates in multiple metabolic pathways and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) is one of the key intracellular enzymes that facilitate the synthesis of NAD. C-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2 (CtBP) are paralogous NAD-dependent oncogenic transcription factors and dehydrogenases that nucleate an epigenetic complex regulating a cohort of genes responsible for cancer proliferation and metastasis. As adequate intracellular NAD is required for CtBP to oligomerize and execute its oncogenic transcriptional coregulatory activities, we hypothesized that NAD depletion would synergize with CtBP inhibition, improving cell inhibitory efficacy. Indeed, depletion of cellular NAD via the NAMPT inhibitor GMX1778 enhanced growth inhibition induced by either RNAi-mediated CtBP1/2 knockdown or the CtBP dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-chlorophenyl-2-hydroxyimino propanoic acid as much as 10-fold in PDAC cells, while untransformed pancreatic ductal cells were unaffected. The growth inhibitory effects of the NAMPT/CtBP inhibitor combination correlated pharmacodynamically with on-target disruption of CtBP1/2 dimerization, CtBP2 interaction with the CoREST epigenetic regulator, and transcriptional activation of the oncogenic target gene TIAM1. Moreover, this same therapeutic combination strongly attenuated growth of PDAC cell line xenografts in immunodeficient mice, with no observable toxicity. Collectively, our data demonstrate that targeting CtBP in combination with NAD depletion represents a promising therapeutic strategy for PDAC. Effective precision therapies are lacking in PDAC. We demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of NAD metabolism and the oncoprotein CtBP is potently effective at blocking growth of both PDAC cells in culture and human PDAC-derived tumors in mice and should be explored further as a potential therapy for patients with PDAC.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 28507103\nTitle: Nicotinic Acid Phosphoribosyltransferase Regulates Cancer Cell Metabolism, Susceptibility to NAMPT Inhibitors, and DNA Repair.\nAbstract: In the last decade, substantial efforts have been made to identify NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis inhibitors, specifically against nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), as preclinical studies indicate their potential efficacy as cancer drugs. However, the clinical activity of NAMPT inhibitors has proven limited, suggesting that alternative NAD<sup>+</sup> production routes exploited by tumors confer resistance. Here, we show the gene encoding nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a second NAD<sup>+</sup>-producing enzyme, is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of common types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, where NAPRT expression correlates with a BRCAness gene expression signature. Both NAPRT and NAMPT increased intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. NAPRT silencing reduced energy status, protein synthesis, and cell size in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. NAPRT silencing sensitized cells to NAMPT inhibitors both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>; similar results were obtained with the NAPRT inhibitor 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. Reducing NAPRT levels in a BRCA2-deficient cancer cell line exacerbated DNA damage in response to chemotherapeutics. In conclusion, NAPRT-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis contributes to cell metabolism and to the DNA repair process in a subset of tumors. This knowledge could be used to increase the efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors and chemotherapy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3857-69. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 37456260\nTitle: The immunomodulatory role of IDO1-Kynurenine-NAD<sup>+</sup> pathway in switching cold tumor microenvironment in PDAC.\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common exocrine tumor of the pancreas characterized by late diagnosis, adverse overall 5-year survival, a higher propensity for metastatic disease, and lack of efficacy of systemic therapy options. These adverse outcomes can be partly attributed to complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Over the past decade, immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of certain cancers; thus far, the immunologically 'non-inflamed' tumor microenvironment in PDACs has proven to be challenging. Indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolic pathway of L-Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, that gives rise to the immunosuppressive metabolite Kynurenine. IDO1, Indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2), and Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) are the key enzymes in the tryptophan catabolic pathway but we focus on the role of the predominant enzyme form IDO1 in this review. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (iNAMPT) regulates the intracellular concentration of NAD and is upregulated in the tumor. In light of the potential role of IDO1 as a driver of hostile TME in PDAC and NAD<sup>+</sup> as a key coenzyme in anti-tumor immune response, this review urges focus on extensive research and initiation of clinical trials using IDO1 and NAMPT inhibitors in pancreatic cancer in the future.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 27233476\nTitle: Regulation of the Nampt-mediated NAD salvage pathway and its therapeutic implications in pancreatic cancer.\nAbstract: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a crucial cofactor for the redox reactions in the metabolic pathways of cancer cells that have elevated aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Cancer cells are reported to rely on NAD recycling and inhibition of the NAD salvage pathway causes metabolic collapse and cell death. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms and clinical implications for the NAD salvage pathway in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. This study showed that the expression of Nampt, the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD salvage pathway, was significantly increased in PDAC cells and PDAC tissues. Additionally, inhibition of Nampt impaired tumor growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo, which was accompanied by a decreased cellular NAD level and glycolytic activity. Mechanistically, the Nampt expression was independent of Kras and p16 status, but it was directly regulated by miR-206, which was inversely correlated with the expression of Nampt in PDAC tissues. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of Nampt by its inhibitor, FK866, significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in PDAC cells and in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. In conclusion, the present study revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for Nampt in PDAC and suggested that Nampt inhibition may override gemcitabine resistance by decreasing the NAD level and suppressing glycolytic activity, warranting further clinical investigation for pancreatic cancer treatment.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===PMID: 35818423\nTitle: Regulation of appetite-related neuropeptides by Panax ginseng: A novel approach for obesity treatment.\nAbstract: Obesity is a primary factor provoking various chronic disorders, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and causes the death of 2.8 million individuals each year. Diet, physical activity, medications, and surgery are the main therapies for overweightness and obesity. During weight loss therapy, a decrease in energy stores activates appetite signaling pathways under the regulation of neuropeptides, including anorexigenic [corticotropin-releasing hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cholecystokinin (CCK), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript] and orexigenic [agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and melanin-concentrating hormone] neuropeptides, which increase food intake and lead to failure in attaining weight loss goals. Ginseng and ginsenosides reverse these signaling pathways by suppressing orexigenic neuropeptides (NPY and AgRP) and provoking anorexigenic neuropeptides (CCK and POMC), which prevent the increase in food intake. Moreover, the results of network pharmacology analysis have revealed that constituents of ginseng radix, including campesterol, beta-elemene, ginsenoside Rb1, biotin, and pantothenic acid, are highly correlated with neuropeptide genes that regulate energy balance and food intake, including <i>ADIPOQ</i>, <i>NAMPT</i>, <i>UBL5</i>, <i>NUCB2</i>, <i>LEP</i>, <i>CCK</i>, <i>GAST</i>, <i>IGF1</i>, <i>RLN1</i>, <i>PENK</i>, <i>PDYN</i>, and <i>POMC</i>. Based on previous studies and network pharmacology analysis data, ginseng and its compounds may be a potent source for obesity treatment by regulating neuropeptides associated with appetite.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 38003249\nTitle: Regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH Redox Involves the Protective Effects of Ginsenoside Rb1 against Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Astrocyte Lesions.\nAbstract: The aim of this study was to investigate NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox regulation in astrocytes by Ginsenoside Rb1 subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and to reveal the neuroprotective mechanism of ginseng. Neonatal mouse brain was used to culture primary astrocytes. The third generation of the primary astrocytes was used for the experiments. OGD/R was introduced by culturing the cells in a glucose-free media under nitrogen for 6 h followed by a regular culture for 24 h. Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury in a dose-dependent manner. It improved the mitochondrial function of OGD/R astrocytes indicated by improving mitochondrial distribution, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhancing mitochondrial DNA copies and ATP production. Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly lifted intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH, NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>, and GSH/GSSG in OGD/R astrocytes. It inhibited the protein expression of both PARP1 and CD38, while attenuating the SIRT1 drop in OGD/R cells. In line with its effects on PARP1, Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced the expression of poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) proteins in OGD/R cells. Ginsenoside Rb1 also significantly increased the expression of NAMPT and NMNAT2, both of which are key players in NAD/NADH synthesis. The results suggest that the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox involves the protective effects of ginsenoside Rb1 against OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36948143\nTitle: Therapeutic application of natural products: NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism as potential target.\nAbstract: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) metabolism is involved in the entire physiopathological process and is critical to human health. Long-term imbalance in NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is associated with various diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, aging, and cancer, making it a potential target for effective therapeutic strategies. Currently, several natural products that target NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism have been widely reported to have significant therapeutic effects, but systematic summaries are lacking. To summarize the latest findings on the prevention and treatment of various diseases through the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism by various natural products in vivo and in vitro models, and evaluate the toxicities of the natural products. PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were searched using the keywords \"natural products sources,\" \"toxicology,\" \"NAD<sup>+</sup> clinical trials,\" and \"NAD<sup>+</sup>,\" and/or paired with \"natural products\" and \"diseases\" for studies published within the last decade until January 2023. We found that the natural products mainly include phenols (curcumin, cyclocurcumin, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, salvianolic acid B, pterostilbene, EGCG), flavonoids (pinostrobin, apigenin, acacetin, tilianin, kaempferol, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, luteolin, silybin, hydroxysafflor yellow A, scutellarin), glycosides (salidroside), quinones (emodin, embelin, \u03b2-LAPachone, shikonin), terpenoids (notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside F2, ginsenoside Rd, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rg3, thymoquinone, genipin), pyrazines (tetramethylpyrazine), alkaloids (evodiamine, berberine), and phenylpropanoids (ferulic acid). These natural products have antioxidant, energy-producing, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-aging effects, which mainly influence the NAMPT/NAD<sup>+</sup>/SIRT, AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf2/HO-1, PKCs/PARPs/NF-\u03baB, and AMPK/Nrf2/mTOR signaling pathways, thereby regulating NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism to prevent and treat various diseases. These natural products have been shown to be safe, tolerable and have fewer adverse effects in various in vivo and in vitro studies and clinical trials. We evaluated the toxic effects of natural products and summarized the available clinical trials on NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, as well as the recent advances in the therapeutic application of natural products targeting NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, with the aim to provide new insights into the treatment of multiple disorders.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n.\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between pancreatic cancer and ginsenoside rb1 through their own interactions with NAMPT.

                "Score: **+1 Point(s)** - Reasoning:\n\n**Hypothesis:** *Ginsenoside Rb1 treats pancreatic cancer.*\n\n**Abstract 1 (PMID: 7954360):**\nThis study evaluated the antitumor effects of various components, including ginsenoside Rb1, on several human cancer cell lines, such as liver cancer cells (PLC/PRF/5, Hep-G2), normal human liver cells (Chang), and a human pancreatic cancer cell line (BxPC-3). Ginsenoside Rb1 required concentrations greater than 1000 micrograms/ml to exhibit any inhibitory effect on the growth of PLC/PRF/5 cells, which is significantly higher compared to other compounds tested. The abstract reports that saikosaponin-a and saikosaponin-d inhibited cell growth and DNA synthesis across all cell lines at much lower concentrations (50 micrograms/ml or less). Notably, the study does not specifically mention any significant inhibitory effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on the pancreatic cancer cell line (BxPC-3). \n\n**Logical inference:** The lack of significant antitumor activity of ginsenoside Rb1 at practical concentrations suggests that it does not effectively treat pancreatic cancer in this context. Therefore, this abstract does not support the hypothesis and introduces some uncertainty about the efficacy of ginsenoside Rb1 against pancreatic cancer.\n\n**Abstract 2 (PMID: 36641437):**\nThis research focused on Aidi injection (ADI), a Chinese herbal medicine used for its antitumor properties, in the treatment of pancreatic cancer using an in vivo mouse model with implanted human pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1). The study identified ginsenoside Rb1 as one of the four active components of ADI through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses revealed that ginsenoside Rb1 has a high affinity for caspase-3 (CASP3), a critical protein in the execution phase of cell apoptosis. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that medium and high concentrations of ADI significantly reduced tumor volume, weight, and histological abnormalities compared to the control group.\n\n**Logical inference:** Since ginsenoside Rb1 is an active component of ADI and is predicted to interact with CASP3 to induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, this suggests a beneficial interaction. The reduction in tumor growth and abnormality in the treated mice supports the hypothesis that ginsenoside Rb1 contributes to treating pancreatic cancer.\n\n**Abstract 3 (PMID: 27893436):**\nThis study explored the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as delivery vehicles for ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1 to enhance their anticancer effects. The conjugation of ginsenoside Rb1 with CNTs (Rb-CNT) allowed for lower doses of the ginsenoside while achieving significant anticancer activity. The Rb-CNT conjugate decreased cell viability by up to 62% in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and enhanced antiproliferative effects by 61% in drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1). Transcriptome profiling indicated that the treatment affected various cellular processes related to apoptosis and response to stimuli.\n\n**Logical inference:** The significant inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by the ginsenoside Rb1-CNT conjugate indicates that ginsenoside Rb1 can effectively treat pancreatic cancer cells, especially when delivered efficiently via CNTs. This supports the hypothesis.\n\n**Synthesis of evidence:**\n- **Supporting evidence:** Abstracts 2 and 3 provide evidence that ginsenoside Rb1 has antitumor effects on pancreatic cancer cells. In Abstract 2, ginsenoside Rb1 is identified as a key active component contributing to the effectiveness of ADI in reducing pancreatic tumor growth in vivo, likely through inducing apoptosis via CASP3. In Abstract 3, ginsenoside Rb1, when effectively delivered using CNTs, significantly inhibits proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1), including drug-resistant cells.\n- **Contradictory evidence:** Abstract 1 does not provide evidence supporting the hypothesis and suggests that ginsenoside Rb1 does not exhibit significant antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer cells at practical concentrations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile there is strong evidence from two abstracts supporting the beneficial effects of ginsenoside Rb1 in treating pancreatic cancer, one abstract indicates a lack of significant effect, introducing some uncertainty. The positive effects in the supporting abstracts involve enhanced delivery methods (e.g., CNT conjugation) or ginsenoside Rb1 as part of a complex mixture (ADI), suggesting that its efficacy might depend on delivery or synergistic effects with other compounds.\n\n**Scoring according to guidelines:**\n- The **+1 score** corresponds to a hypothesis that is *likely supported* by the provided texts, with evidence suggesting that the interaction between pancreatic cancer and ginsenoside Rb1 may align with the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n- Given that multiple abstracts provide evidence of a beneficial interaction, but one abstract does not support the hypothesis and indicates limited efficacy of ginsenoside Rb1 alone at certain concentrations, the appropriate score is **+1**.\n\n**Therefore, Score: +1 Point(s)**"

The concentration of each component required for 50% inhibition of cell growth of PLC/PRF/5 cells was as follows: saikosaponin-d, baicalin, 20 micrograms/ml; saikosaponin-a, baicalein, 50 micrograms/ml; saikosaponin-b2, -c, ginsenoside-Rb1, -Rg1, glycyrrhizin, > 1000 micrograms/ml. Saikosaponin-a in 50-micrograms/ml quantities inhibited the cell growth and DNA synthesis of all the cell lines tested. These results indicate that 'Sho-saiko-to' includes potent antitumor components such as saikosaponin-a, -d, baicalin against human hepatoma cells as well as other human cell lines.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT=== PMID: 36641437\nTitle: Identification of key pharmacological components and targets for Aidi injection in the treatment of pancreatic cancer by UPLC-MS, network pharmacology, and in vivo experiments.\nAbstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Aidi injection (ADI) is a representative antitumor medication based on Chinese herbal injection, but its antitumor mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, the subcutaneous xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was established in nude mice to investigate the anticancer effect of ADI in vivo. We then determined the components of ADI using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and explored the possible molecular mechanisms against pancreatic cancer using network pharmacology. In vivo experiments, the volume, weight, and degree of histological abnormalities of implanted tumors were significantly lower in the medium and high concentration ADI injection groups than in the control group. Network pharmacology analysis identified four active components of ADI and seven key targets, TNF, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, MAPK14, CASP3, P53 and JUN. Molecular docking also revealed high affinity between the active components and the target proteins, including Astragaloside IV to P53 and VEGFA, Ginsenoside Rb1 to CASP3 and Formononetin to JUN. ADI could reduce the growth rate of tumor tissue and alleviate the structural abnormalities in tumor tissue. ADI is predicted to act on VEGFA, P53, CASP3, and JUN in ADI-mediated treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n. PMID: 27893436\nTitle: Carbon nanotubes as carriers of Panax ginseng metabolites and enhancers of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 anti-cancer activity.\nAbstract: A major benefit to nanomaterial based-medicine is the ability to provide nanosized vehicles for sporadic metabolites. Here, we describe how the conjugation of valuable ginseng secondary metabolites (ginsenoside Rb1 or Rg1) with carbon nanotubes (CNT) can enhance their anti-proliferative and anti-cancer effects. Ginsenoside-CNT conjugate (Rb-CNT or Rg-CNT) permitted the ginsenosides to be used at a low dose, yet achieve a higher incidence of cancer killing. We were able to demonstrate that the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate can decrease cell viability up to 62% in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and enhance antiproliferation of drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) by 61%. The interaction of the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate with breast cancer cells was studied using Raman Spectroscopy mapping. Total transcriptome profiling (Affymetrix platform) of MCF-7 cells treated with the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate shows that a number of cellular, apoptotic and response to stimulus processes were affected. Therefore, our data confirmed the potential use of CNT as a drug delivery system.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: ginsenoside rb1 treats pancreatic cancer., which posits an interaction between pancreatic cancer and ginsenoside rb1.
