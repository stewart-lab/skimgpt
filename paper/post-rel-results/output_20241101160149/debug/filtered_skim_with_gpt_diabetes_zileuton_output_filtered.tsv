Title: Inflammation and cancer: how hot is the link?
Abstract: Although inflammation has long been known as a localized protective reaction of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection, characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function, there has been a new realization about its role in a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. While acute inflammation is a part of the defense response, chronic inflammation can lead to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological diseases. Several pro-inflammatory gene products have been identified that mediate a critical role in suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Among these gene products are TNF and members of its superfamily, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, chemokines, MMP-9, VEGF, COX-2, and 5-LOX. The expression of all these genes are mainly regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is constitutively active in most tumors and is induced by carcinogens (such as cigarette smoke), tumor promoters, carcinogenic viral proteins (HIV-tat, HIV-nef, HIV-vpr, KHSV, EBV-LMP1, HTLV1-tax, HPV, HCV, and HBV), chemotherapeutic agents, and gamma-irradiation. These observations imply that anti-inflammatory agents that suppress NF-kappaB or NF-kappaB-regulated products should have a potential in both the prevention and treatment of cancer. The current review describes in detail the critical link between inflammation and cancer.

Title: Role of Lectin-Like Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-1 in Inflammation and Pathogen-Associated Interactions.
Abstract: Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is known as a major receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and plays a significant role in the genesis of atherosclerosis. Recent research has shown its involvement in cancer, ischemic stroke, and diabetes. LOX-1 is a C-type lectin receptor and is involved in the activation of immune cells and inflammatory processes. It may further interact with pathogens, suggesting a role in infections or the host's response. This review compiles the current knowledge of potential implications of LOX-1 in inflammatory processes and in host-pathogen interactions with a particular emphasis on its regulatory role in immune responses. Also discussed are genomic and structural variations found in LOX-1 homologs across different species as well as potential involvements of LOX-1 in inflammatory processes from the angle of different cell types and organ-specific interactions. The results presented reveal both similar and different structures in human and murine LOX-1 and provide clues as to the possible origins of different modes of interaction. These descriptions raise concerns about the suitability, particularly of mouse models, that are often used in the analysis of its functionality in humans. Further research should also aim to better understand the mostly unknown binding and interaction mechanisms between LOX-1 and different pathogens. This pursuit will not only enhance our understanding of LOX-1 involvement in inflammatory processes but also identify potential targets for immunomodulatory approaches.

Title: Therapeutic roles of curcumin: lessons learned from clinical trials.
Abstract: Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, β-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-κB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-β, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.

Title: The role of adipogenic capacity and dysfunctional subcutaneous adipose tissue in the inheritance of type 2 diabetes mellitus: cross-sectional study.
Abstract: This study tested the hypothesis that limited subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) expansion represents a primary predisposition to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), independent of obesity, and identified novel markers of SAT dysfunction in the inheritance of T2DM. First-degree relatives (FDR) of T2DM patients (n = 19) and control individuals (n = 19) without obesity (fat mass < 25%) were cross-sectionally compared. Body composition (bioimpedance, computed tomography) and insulin sensitivity (IS; oral glucose tolerance test, clamp) were measured. SAT obtained by needle biopsy was used to analyze adipocyte size, lipidome, mRNA expression, and inflammatory markers. Primary cultures of adipose precursors were analyzed for adipogenic capacity and metabolism. Compared with control individuals, FDR individuals had lower IS and a higher amount of visceral fat. However, SAT-derived adipose precursors did not differ in their ability to proliferate and differentiate or in metabolic parameters (lipolysis, mitochondrial oxidation). In SAT of FDR individuals, lipidomic and mRNA expression analysis revealed accumulation of triglycerides containing polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased mRNA expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX). These parameters correlated with IS, visceral fat accumulation, and mRNA expression of inflammatory and cellular stress genes. The intrinsic adipogenic potential of SAT is not affected by a family history of T2DM. However, alterations in LOX mRNA and polyunsaturated fatty acids in triacylglycerols are likely related to the risk of developing T2DM independent of obesity.

Title: Curcumin: getting back to the roots.
Abstract: The use of turmeric, derived from the root of the plant Curcuma longa, for treatment of different inflammatory diseases has been described in Ayurveda and in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. The active component of turmeric responsible for this activity, curcumin, was identified almost two centuries ago. Modern science has revealed that curcumin mediates its effects by modulation of several important molecular targets, including transcription factors (e.g., NF-kappaB, AP-1, Egr-1, beta-catenin, and PPAR-gamma), enzymes (e.g., COX2, 5-LOX, iNOS, and hemeoxygenase-1), cell cycle proteins (e.g., cyclin D1 and p21), cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and chemokines), receptors (e.g., EGFR and HER2), and cell surface adhesion molecules. Because it can modulate the expression of these targets, curcumin is now being used to treat cancer, arthritis, diabetes, Crohn's disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, psoriasis, and other pathologies. Interestingly, 6-gingerol, a natural analog of curcumin derived from the root of ginger (Zingiber officinalis), exhibits a biologic activity profile similar to that of curcumin. The efficacy, pharmacologic safety, and cost effectiveness of curcuminoids prompt us to ""get back to our roots.""

Title: Impaired phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages from diabetic rats is related to the deficient coupling of LTs to the Fc gamma R signaling cascade.
Abstract: Diabetic individuals are more susceptible to infections and this seems to be related to impaired phagocyte function. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the first barrier to prevent respiratory infections. Leukotrienes (LTs) increase AM phagocytic activity via Fc gamma R. In this study, we compared AMs from diabetic and non-diabetic rats for phagocytosis via Fc gamma R and the roles of LTs and insulin. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by alloxan (42 mg/kg, i.v.); macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and IgG-opsonised sheep red blood cells (IgG-SRBC) were used as targets. LTs were added to the AMs 5 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC. AMs were treated with a LT synthesis inhibitor (zileuton, 10 microM), or antagonists of the LTB(4) receptor (CP105.696, 10 microM) or cys-LT receptor (MK571, 10 microM), 30 or 20 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC, respectively. We found that the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC by AMs from diabetic rats is impaired compared with non-diabetic rats. Treatment with the LT inhibitor/antagonists significantly reduced AM phagocytosis in non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. During the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC LTB(4) and LTC(4) were produced by AMs from both groups. The addition of exogenous LTB(4) or LTD(4) potentiated phagocytosis similarly in both groups. Phagocytosis was followed by the phosphorylation of PKC-delta, ERK and Akt. This was reduced by zileuton treatment in AMs from non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. The addition of insulin to AMs further increased the phagocytosis by increasing PKC-delta phosphorylation. These results suggest that the impaired phagocytosis found in AMs from diabetic rats is related to a deficient coupling of LTs to the Fc gamma R signaling cascade and that insulin has a key role in this coupling. An essential role for insulin in innate immunity is suggested.

Title: Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats.
Abstract: The binding of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to the 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) is a prerequisite for subsequent formation of leukotrienes (LT) from arachidonic acid. We have shown that FLAP antagonist administration decreased proteinuria in glomerulonephritic patients. In this follow-up study, we assessed the role for FLAP in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with FLAP (BAY X-1005, 200 mg/kg) or 5-LO (Zileuton, 80 mg/Kg) antagonists. Proteinuria, renal function and LT production was assessed. We also determined protein permeability of cultured glomerular endothelial cells (which possess no 5-LO) by measuring their permeability to radiolabeled albumin with and without FLAP antagonists. FLAP mRNA levels increased dramatically in glomeruli from diabetic animals compared to controls. Inhibition of FLAP (but not inhibition of 5-LO) reduced proteinuria, with no effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Interestingly, diabetes-induced rises in urinary excretion and glomerular production of leukotrienes were not modified by the inhibitors. Increased FLAP expression in glomerular endothelial cells in culture was associated with an increase in albumin permeability, and this increase was abolished by FLAP antagonists. On the other hand, addition of LTA(4) led to increases in leukotriene formation and in permeability. This increase in permeability was also reduced by co-incubation with FLAP antagonists, whereas the increase in leukotriene synthesis was not modified. These results suggest a role for FLAP other than the activation of 5-LO, possibly in protein handling, and point to FLAP antagonists as anti-proteinuric agents.

Title: 5-Lipoxygenase metabolite 4-HDHA is a mediator of the antiangiogenic effect of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Abstract: Lipid signaling is dysregulated in many diseases with vascular pathology, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-α. To better understand the protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. ω-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary ω-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the ω-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that ω-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of ω-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation. It also suggests that cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen (but not lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton) might be used without losing the beneficial effect of dietary ω-3 PUFA.

Title: Structure and ligand based design for identification of highly potent molecules against 5-LOX.
Abstract: We report here small molecules consisting of dichlorophenyl substituted oxindole that is further tagged with pyrrole/indole moieties. These molecules were designed on the basis of the analysis of binding mode of 5-LOX with arachidonic acid and zileuton. The molecules traverse the active site pocket of the enzyme that otherwise hosts AA and zileuton. Moreover, with a provision of derivatization at pyrrole/indole-N, the physico-chemical properties of the molecules can be adjusted. Appreciable 5-LOX inhibitory activities of the compounds in sub-micromolar range were observed and their aqueous solubility, binding with human serum albumin and stability in blood plasma and liver microsomes were checked. The Michaelis-Menten constants obtained during the binding of the compounds with 5-LOX indicated competitive binding of the compounds with the enzyme. Overall, the combination of molecular modelling and experimental studies identified promising molecules against inflammatory diseases.

Title: Eicosanoid modulation in advanced lung cancer: cyclooxygenase-2 expression is a positive predictive factor for celecoxib + chemotherapy--Cancer and Leukemia Group B Trial 30203.
Abstract: Increased expression of eicosanoids in cancer has been associated with adverse prognosis. We performed a randomized phase II trial to test the hypothesis that inhibitors of two eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], celecoxib and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX], zileuton) added to chemotherapy would improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC, a performance status of 0 to 2, and no prior therapy were eligible. All patients received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 mg/mL x min day 1 + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) days 1 and 8. Patients were randomly assigned to: (a) zileuton 600 mg PO qid, (b) celecoxib 400 mg PO bid, or (c) celecoxib and zileuton at the same doses. Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and 5-LOX was performed without knowledge of outcomes. One hundred forty patients were entered and 134 were eligible and treated. There was no survival difference between the arms. COX-2 expression was a negative prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.51, P = .019 for index >or= 4; HR = 4.16, P = .005 for index = 9) for patients not receiving celecoxib. Patients with increased COX-2 expression (index >or= 4), receiving celecoxib had better survival than did COX-2-expressing patients not receiving drug (HR = .342, P = .005 for OS; HR = .294, P = .002 for failure-free survival). Multivariate analysis confirmed the interaction of COX-2 and celecoxib on survival. 5-LOX expression was neither prognostic nor predictive. This study failed to demonstrate the value of dual eicosanoid inhibition or benefit from either agent alone in addition to chemotherapy. However, a prospectively defined subset analysis suggests an advantage for celecoxib and chemotherapy for patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression.

Title: LC-QToF chemical profiling of Euphorbia grantii Oliv. and its potential to inhibit LPS-induced lung inflammation in rats via the NF-κB, CY450P2E1, and P38 MAPK14 pathways.
Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening syndrome that causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aerial parts of Euphorbia grantii Oliv. were extracted with methanol to give a total methanolic extract (TME), which was further fractionated into dichloromethane (DCMF) and the remaining mother liquor (MLF) fractions. Biological guided anti-inflammatory assays in vitro revealed that the DCMF showed the highest activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.9 ± 0.2 μg/mL and 0.29 ± 0.01 μg/mL) compared to. celecoxib (IC<sub>50</sub> of 88.0 ± 1 μg/mL and 0.30 ± 0.01 μg/mL) on COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. Additionally, anti-LOX activity was IC<sub>50</sub> = 24.0 ± 2.5 μg/mL vs. zileuton with IC<sub>50</sub> of 40.0 ± 0.5 μg/mL. LC-DAD-QToF analysis of TME and the active DCMF resulted in the tentative identification and characterization of 56 phytochemical compounds, where the diterpenes were the dominated metabolites. An LPS-induced inflammatory model of ALI (10 mg/kg i.p) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of DCMF in vivo at dose of 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg compared to dexamethasone (5 mg/kg i.p). Our treatments significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and MPO), increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH), decreased the activity of oxidative stress enzyme (MDA), and reduced the expression of inflammatory genes (p38.MAPK14 and CY450P2E1). The western blotting of NF-κB p65 in lung tissues was inhibited after orally administration of the DCMF. Histopathological study of the lung tissues, scoring, and immunohistochemistry of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) were also assessed. In both dose regimens, DCMF of E. grantii prevented further lung damage and reduced the side effects of LPS on acute lung tissue injury.

Title: Overexpression of 5-lipoxygenase in colon polyps and cancer and the effect of 5-LOX inhibitors in vitro and in a murine model.
Abstract: Arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways modulates cell growth and apoptosis. Many studies have examined the effects of COX inhibitors on human colorectal cancer, but the role of 5-LOX in colonic cancer development has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of 5-LOX in colonic polyps and cancer and the effect of 5-LOX inhibition on colon cancer cell proliferation. Colonic polyps, cancer, and normal mucosa were evaluated for 5-LOX expression by immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to establish 5-LOX expression in colon cancer cells. Thymidine incorporation and cell counts were used to determine the effect of the nonspecific LOX inhibitor Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid and the 5-LOX inhibitor Rev5901 on DNA synthesis. A heterotopic xenograft model in athymic mice using HT29 and LoVo human colon cancer cells was used to evaluate the effect of the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton on tumor growth. 5-LOX is overexpressed in adenomatous polyps and cancer compared with that of normal colonic mucosa. LOX inhibition and 5-LOX inhibition decreased DNA synthesis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in the Lovo cell line (P < 0.05). Inhibition of 5-LOX in an in vivo colon cancer xenograft model inhibited tumor growth compared with that of controls (P < 0.05). This study showed that 5-LOX is up-regulated in adenomatous colon polyps and cancer compared with normal colonic mucosa. The blockade of 5-LOX inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and may prove a beneficial chemopreventive therapy in colon cancer.
