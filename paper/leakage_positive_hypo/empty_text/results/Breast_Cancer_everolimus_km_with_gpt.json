                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning: Because no relevant abstracts were provided (no PMIDs available), I must rely on my internal knowledge of everolimus in Breast Cancer. Clinically, everolimus is well recognized for its efficacy in combination with endocrine therapy for hormone receptor\u2013positive advanced or metastatic Breast Cancer, improving progression-free survival and overall disease control. There is no contradictory evidence presented here, and published clinical findings (such as from the well-known BOLERO-2 trial) consistently support the efficacy of everolimus in this setting. Therefore, based on my general biomedical understanding, the hypothesis that treatment with everolimus improves Breast Cancer patient outcomes is strongly supported."

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nUse your own knowledge to determine the relevance of the abstract to the hypothesis.\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: None found\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus. \nThe texts provided above should be your primary source of information for arriving at your classification result. However, if the texts are inconclusive or insufficient, use your internal knowledge about Breast Cancer and everolimus to make your best assessment.\n\nIMPORTANT: When evidence is drawn directly from the provided abstracts, you must cite the relevant PMIDs (only those listed above). Do not reference or cite any external literature or PMIDs not in the list above. If your assessment relies primarily on your internal knowledge because the abstracts are insufficient, state this clearly in your reasoning.\n\nHypothesis:\nTreatment with everolimus will improve Breast Cancer patient outcomes.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Review each abstract to understand how Breast Cancer and everolimus might be interconnected based on the available information.\n2. Analyze the presence and implications of the term pairing (Breast Cancer + everolimus) in the context of the hypothesis, considering both the text and your general knowledge.\n3. Synthesize the findings from multiple texts. Consider how the pieces fit together to support or refute the hypothesis: Treatment with everolimus will improve Breast Cancer patient outcomes.. Remember, no single text may be conclusive.\n4. If the provided abstracts offer limited or contradictory evidence regarding the hypothesis, use your general understanding of the biological roles and interactions of Breast Cancer and everolimus to inform your score and reasoning. Clearly indicate when your conclusion is based on this inferred knowledge rather than direct textual evidence.\n5. Provide a justification for your scoring decision based on the analysis. Explain your reasoning step-by-step in terms understandable to an undergraduate biochemist. Focus on explaining the logical connections and the directionality of relationships, drawing from the text when possible.\n6. Cite specific texts from your set of abstracts to support your arguments when possible, using the format \"PMID: XXXXX\". If the abstracts do not provide sufficient evidence, explain your reasoning based on your general biomedical knowledge about the interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus.\n\nFormat your response as:\nScore: [Number] - Reasoning: [Reasoning]\n\nScoring Guidelines:\n\u2022 **-2:** The hypothesis is **refuted** by consistent evidence indicating that the interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus **contradicts** the proposed outcome.\n\u2022 **-1:** The hypothesis is **likely refuted** based on the evidence. There is moderate indication that the interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus **contradicts** the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n\u2022 **0:** The hypothesis is **neither supported nor refuted** by the provided texts. The evidence regarding the interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus is inconclusive, mixed, lacks sufficient detail, or there is a lack of evidence.\n\u2022 **+1:** The hypothesis is **likely supported** by the provided texts. The evidence suggests that the interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus may **align with** the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n\u2022 **+2:** The hypothesis is **supported** by consistent evidence indicating that the interaction between Breast Cancer and everolimus **aligns with** the proposed outcome, with no significant contradictory evidence.",
