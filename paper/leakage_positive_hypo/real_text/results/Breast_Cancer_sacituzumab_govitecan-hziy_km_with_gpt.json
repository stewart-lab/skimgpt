                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nCollectively, the abstracts consistently indicate that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy improves outcomes for patients with breast cancer, specifically in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). For instance, PMID: 35728046 reports on significant survival benefit and suggests that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy should be considered a new standard of care in pretreated mTNBC. PMID: 30786188 documents a notable objective response rate (33%) and durable responses in heavily pretreated mTNBC, and corroborating data in PMIDs: 32529410, 33168656, and 33070624 led to the accelerated FDA approval of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Across these references, there is no significant contradictory evidence, and multiple studies report improvements in key clinical outcomes (objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival). Thus, the hypothesis that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy treatment confers improved outcomes in breast cancer is strongly supported."

Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), the anti-Trop-2 antibody-drug conjugate, resulted in a significant survival benefit over chemotherapy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). The greatest efficacy was observed in those who had a medium or high Trop-2 score. However, the importance of Trop-2 as a potential predictive factor requires further research. Elderly patients also appear to benefit from treating with SG. While the early results are encouraging, the ultimate benefit of SG in patients with brain metastases has yet to be determined. Early phase studies have shown that SG is also active in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic BC. The most common side effects of SG are nausea, neutropenia and diarrhea. Currently, several clinical trials are in progress with SG in monotherapy and in combination treatment for various types of BC. Taken together, SG should be considered as a new standard of care in patients with pretreated mTNBC. This review summarizes the development and highlights recent advances of the SG in BC.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30786188\nTitle: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Refractory Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: Standard chemotherapy is associated with low response rates and short progression-free survival among patients with pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines a humanized monoclonal antibody, which targets the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), with SN-38, which is conjugated to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy enables delivery of high concentrations of SN-38 to tumors. We conducted a phase 1/2 single-group, multicenter trial involving patients with advanced epithelial cancers who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. A total of 108 patients received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight after receiving at least two previous anticancer therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review. The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in \u226510% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7). Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was associated with durable objective responses in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Myelotoxic effects were the main adverse reactions.

In April 2020, sacituzumab govitecan received accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Sacituzumab govitecan is undergoing phase III development for breast cancer in the USA and EU, and phase II development for urothelial cancer. It is also being explored for brain metastases, glioblastoma, endometrial cancer and prostate cancer. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of sacituzumab govitecan leading to this first approval for mTNBC.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33168656\nTitle: FDA Approval Summary: Accelerated Approval of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy for Third-line Treatment of Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: On April 22, 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (TRODELVY; Immunomedics, Inc.) for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Approval was based on data from the IMMU-132-01 trial, a single-arm, multicohort, multicenter, phase I/II trial of sacituzumab govitecan. The assessment of efficacy was based on 108 patients with mTNBC who had previously received at least two prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting and who received sacituzumab govitecan 10 mg/kg i.v. The assessment of safety was based on 408 patients with advanced solid tumors who had received sacituzumab govitecan at doses up to 10 mg/kg i.v. The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) was a key secondary endpoint. The ORR was 33.3% [36/108; 95% confidence interval (CI), 24.6-43.1], and median DoR among responders was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9-10.8). The most common adverse reactions occurring in \u226525% of patients were nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, rash, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. This article summarizes the FDA review process and data supporting the approval of sacituzumab govitecan.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33070624\nTitle: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy: An Antibody-Drug Conjugate for the Treatment of Refractory, Metastatic, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sacituzumab govitecan (-hziy; IMMU-132, Trodelvy) for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease.
