                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \n\nThe collective evidence from these abstracts consistently supports the hypothesis that toremifene improves outcomes in breast cancer. First, clinical findings (PMID: 7595707) show that toremifene is at least as effective as tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, noting comparable or slightly higher response rates and similar overall survival. This indicates clear therapeutic benefit. Second, the mechanism data (PMID: 8350365) demonstrate that toremifene can drive apoptosis and growth inhibition in estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, reinforcing a plausible biological basis for its beneficial effects. Reviews discussing toremifene (e.g., PMID: 25936229) consider it one of the selective estrogen receptor modulators with an acceptable or even improved safety profile compared with tamoxifen. Although some studies (PMID: 10375015) note upregulation of angiogenic factors, no abstract here provides contradictory clinical evidence negating toremifene\u2019s beneficial role. Consequently, these sources collectively offer strong support (+2) for the hypothesis that toremifene treatment can improve breast cancer patient outcomes."

Depending upon the degree of ER agonism/antagonism at the target tissue, SERMs show efficacy for various indications including osteoporosis, dyspareunia, and breast cancer, and are associated with safety risks. This review describes the safety profile of SERMs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, toremifene, bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene, and ospemifene) and fulvestrant (a pure ER antagonist) from Phase III trials, long-term extension studies, and active comparator studies. Tamoxifen, a first-generation SERM, is indicated for breast cancer prevention and treatment but is associated with serious safety concerns including endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolic events (VTE), and stroke. Toremifene, raloxifene, bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene, and ospemifene present generally improved, though distinctly different, safety profiles compared with tamoxifen, especially with endometrial cancer and stroke. However, the risk of VTE remains a concern for most SERMs. Each SERM presents a unique risk/benefit profile based on varying indications and tissue-specific ER agonist and antagonist effects, making careful patient selection and ongoing patient monitoring crucial aspects of treatment. Future research may focus on identifying new SERMs for endocrine-resistant and endocrine-responsive cancers and post-menopausal symptoms.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 14576841\nTitle: Antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer and the role of estrogen receptor signaling.\nAbstract: Antiestrogens include agents such as tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, and fulvestrant. Currently, tamoxifen is the only drug approved for use in breast cancer chemoprevention, and it remains the treatment of choice for most women with hormone receptor positive, invasive breast carcinoma. While antiestrogens have been available since the early 1970s, we still do not fully understand their mechanisms of action and resistance. Essentially, two forms of antiestrogen resistance occur: de novo resistance and acquired resistance. Absence of estrogen receptor (ER) expression is the most common de novo resistance mechanism, whereas a complete loss of ER expression is not common in acquired resistance. Antiestrogen unresponsiveness appears to be the major acquired resistance phenotype, with a switch to an antiestrogen-stimulated growth being a minor phenotype. Since antiestrogens compete with estrogens for binding to ER, clinical response to antiestrogens may be affected by exogenous estrogenic exposures. Such exposures include estrogenic hormone replacement therapies and dietary and environmental exposures that directly or indirectly increase a tumor's estrogenic environment. Whether antiestrogen resistance can be conferred by a switch from predominantly ERalpha to ERbeta expression remains unanswered, but predicting response to antiestrogen therapy requires only measurement of ERalpha expression. The role of altered receptor coactivator or corepressor expression in antiestrogen resistance also is unclear, and understanding their roles may be confounded by their ubiquitous expression and functional redundancy. We have proposed a gene network approach to exploring the mechanistic aspects of antiestrogen resistance. Using transcriptome and proteome analyses, we have begun to identify candidate genes that comprise one component of a larger, putative gene network. These candidate genes include NFkappaB, interferon regulatory factor-1, nucleophosmin, and the X-box binding protein-1. The network also may involve signaling through ras and MAPK, implicating crosstalk with growth factors and cytokines. Ultimately, signaling affects the expression/function of the proliferation and/or apoptotic machineries.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 10375015\nTitle: Vascular endothelial growth factors are differentially regulated by steroid hormones and antiestrogens in breast cancer cells.\nAbstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major inducer of tumor angiogenesis and an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Hypoxia is an important inducer of VEGF expression but less is known of the role of hormones in VEGF regulation. We have studied the regulation of VEGF, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D mRNAs in human MCF-7 and mouse S115 breast carcinoma cells stimulated by estrogens and androgens, respectively. VEGF, VEGF-B, and VEGF-C were expressed in both cell lines, whereas VEGF-D was expressed only in S115 cells. Addition of estradiol (E2) caused a biphasic increase of VEGF mRNA in MCF-7 cells and led to accumulation of the VEGF protein in the culture medium. The VEGF-B mRNA was not affected, while a decrease occurred in VEGF-C mRNA. Similarly, testosterone upregulated the expression of VEGF mRNA in the S115 cells. Experiments with actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggested that estrogen induction of VEGF mRNA is dependent on the synthesis of new mRNA and increased mRNA half-life. The antiestrogen ICI 182.780 inhibited E2 stimulation of VEGF, suggesting that the effect was mediated by the estrogen receptor. In contrast, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and toremifene which inhibit MCF-7 cell growth in vivo and in vitro did not inhibit estrogen effect but induced VEGF mRNA expression when used alone. The antiandrogen cyprosterone acetate inhibited T induction of VEGF mRNA in S115 cells, thus suggesting that activation of androgen receptor must be involved in the increase of VEGF mRNA. Our results suggest that both estrogen and androgen stimulate the expression of VEGF by increasing gene transcription and mRNA stability. In addition, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and toremifene also increased VEGF expression. Estrogen and androgen induction of VEGF expression and promotion of new vessel formation may be an important paracrine mechanism by which these hormones contribute to the early phase of tumor growth of hormonal cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 8350365\nTitle: Apoptosis in toremifene-induced growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.\nAbstract: Antiestrogens inhibit the stimulative effects of estrogens on breast cancer growth, but the mechanism(s) by which they trigger tumor regression are not completely understood. Growth retardation and tumor regression can be achieved by enhanced cell death and/or arrested cell proliferation. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a new antiestrogen, toremifene, on human breast cancer cells grown either in culture or as tumors in nude mice. The growth and morphology of in vitro cultured cells of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were monitored by time-lapse video. MCF-7 cells and ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells were grown as tumors in nude mice and subsequently examined by electron microscopy. The integrity of DNA isolated from these cells was determined by standard gel electrophoretic techniques. Northern blot hybridization analysis was used to determine the steady-state levels of the mRNAs for testosterone-repressed prostatic message-2 (TRPM-2), tumor growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta 1), and pS2 (a small, cysteine-rich protein of unknown function). Time-lapse video microscopy of the cell cultures indicated that treatment with 7.5 microM toremifene for 3 days caused approximately 60% of the cells to exhibit morphologic characteristics typical of cells undergoing programmed death, or apoptosis. The number of mitoses gradually decreased to zero over a 3- to 4-day period. Estrogen withdrawal for the same length of time resulted in an approximately equal number of apoptoses and mitoses. These changes were not associated with the pattern of DNA fragmentation, detectable as ladders in agarose gels, that is characteristic of the DNA of cells undergoing apoptosis. Elevated levels of TRPM-2 and TGF beta 1 mRNAs were observed in in vitro or in vivo grown tumor cells treated with 5-10 microM toremifene. Elevated levels of TRPM-2, but not TGF beta 1, mRNA were observed in the tumor cells after estrogen withdrawal. The steady-state level of pS2 mRNA in the tumor cells dropped in response to either toremifene treatment or estrogen withdrawal. Toremifene causes growth inhibition of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells by inducing some cells to undergo apoptosis and by inhibiting other cells from entering mitosis. The higher than normal amounts of TRPM-2 and TGF beta 1 protein that would likely result from the elevated levels of TRPM-2 and TGF beta 1 mRNAs measured in these cells after toremifene treatment may have an important role in the growth inhibition process. Apoptosis as an active, targeted process provides a potential new therapeutic approach for treating breast cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 7595707\nTitle: Randomized comparison of tamoxifen and two separate doses of toremifene in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer.\nAbstract: To perform a randomized three-arm comparison of tamoxifen (TAM; 20 mg/d) and two separate doses of toremifene (TOR; 60 mg/d [TOR60] and 200 mg/d [TOR200]) in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer. Six hundred forty-eight patients with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive TAM (n = 215), TOR60 (n = 221), or TOR200 (n = 212). The combined response rates (by intent to treat) were as follows;: TAM, 44%; TOR60, 50%; and TOR200, 48%. Complete and partial response rates were as follows: TAM, 19%; TOR60, 21%, and TOR200, 23% (not statistically different). Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. Adverse events (lethal, serious but nonlethal, and important but non-life-threatening) were similar in all three arms, except that patients in the TOR200 arm had a statistically significantly increased rate of nausea (37% v 26% and 26% for TOR200, TAM, and TOR60, respectively; P = .027). Quality-of-life assessments were not different among the three arms. The activity, toxicity, and side effects of TOR in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer are similar if not equivalent to those of TAM. We detected no clear evidence of a dose-response effect for TOR. TOR60 is an effective and safe agent for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer and can be considered an alternative to TAM as first-line treatment for such patients.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 25936229, 14576841, 10375015, 8350365, 7595707\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and toremifene. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and toremifene. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
