                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAll five provided abstracts (PMID: 524421, 738447, 603774, 587671, 119996) report that olaparib failed to improve key clinical outcomes (e.g., progression-free survival or overall survival) in breast cancer populations, including BRCA\u2010mutated and unselected cohorts. For instance, PMID: 524421 found no significant difference in PFS or OS for olaparib compared to standard chemotherapy in metastatic BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Similar null findings are reported by PMID: 738447 in an unselected advanced breast cancer population. The remaining abstracts (PMID: 603774, 587671, 119996) repeat this pattern of negative results, demonstrating no clear improvement in patient outcomes (e.g., PFS, OS, ORR) with olaparib relative to control. Because these studies are consistent in indicating a lack of benefit for olaparib, the evidence collectively refutes the hypothesis that olaparib improves outcomes in breast cancer."

This study aimed to assess whether olaparib improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard chemotherapy in BRCA-mutated MBC patients.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 320 patients with confirmed germline BRCA1/2 mutations and HER2-negative MBC were randomized 1:1 to receive either olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician\u2019s choice of standard chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the olaparib and chemotherapy arms (median PFS: 7.1 vs. 6.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76\u20131.19; p = 0.64). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS: 19.4 vs. 20.1 months; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82\u20131.27; p = 0.85). ORR was comparable between groups (32.5% for olaparib vs. 29.8% for chemotherapy; p = 0.54). Adverse events were consistent with known profiles, with olaparib associated with higher rates of anemia (42% vs. 18%) but lower rates of neutropenia (12% vs. 34%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized trial, olaparib did not demonstrate superior efficacy over standard chemotherapy in BRCA-mutated MBC patients. These findings suggest that olaparib may not be a preferred first-line option in this population, warranting further investigation into predictive biomarkers or combination strategies.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Olaparib, PARP inhibitor, metastatic breast cancer, BRCA mutation, chemotherapy, progression-free survival\n\n---\n\nPMID: 738447. **Title:** *A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Olaparib in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Negative Outcome Study*  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Background:** Olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has shown promise in BRCA-mutated cancers, but its efficacy in unselected advanced breast cancer populations remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the clinical benefit of olaparib versus standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 450 patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer were randomized (1:1) to receive either olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician\u2019s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Population:** Eligible patients had measurable disease, ECOG performance status 0\u20131, and prior exposure to at least one line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. BRCA mutation status was not required for enrollment.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients received olaparib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received standard chemotherapy per institutional guidelines.  \n\n**Outcomes:** Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.5\u20135.1) in the olaparib arm versus 4.5 months (95% CI: 3.8\u20135.3) in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.89\u20131.31; *p* = 0.42). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 15.6 vs. 16.1 months; HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84\u20131.24; *p* = 0.81). ORR was 12% with olaparib versus 14% with chemotherapy (*p* = 0.56). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 35% of olaparib-treated patients (mainly anemia and fatigue) versus 42% in the chemotherapy group (neutropenia and hand-foot syndrome).  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this unselected advanced breast cancer population, olaparib did not improve PFS, OS, or ORR compared to standard chemotherapy. These findings suggest that olaparib lacks significant clinical benefit outside of biomarker-selected cohorts.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** PARP inhibitor, metastatic breast cancer, olaparib, chemotherapy, randomized controlled trial\n\n---\n\nPMID: 603774. **Title: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Olaparib in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Negative Result Study**  \n\n**Background:** Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as olaparib, have shown promise in BRCA-mutated cancers, but their efficacy in unselected advanced breast cancer populations remains uncertain. This phase III trial aimed to assess whether olaparib improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer, irrespective of BRCA status.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 450 patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or placebo, in addition to standard chemotherapy. Eligible patients had measurable disease and were stratified by hormone receptor status and prior chemotherapy lines. The primary endpoint was PFS by RECIST v1.1, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the olaparib and placebo arms (median PFS 6.2 vs. 5.8 months; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.12; p=0.38). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS 19.1 vs. 18.7 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.16; p=0.72). The ORR was comparable between groups (28.4% vs. 25.1%, p=0.42). Subgroup analyses in BRCA-mutated patients (n=65) also showed no significant PFS benefit (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57\u20131.27; p=0.43). Treatment-related adverse events were higher with olaparib (grade \u22653: 42% vs. 29%), primarily anemia and fatigue.  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized trial, olaparib did not significantly improve PFS or OS in patients with advanced breast cancer, regardless of BRCA status. These findings suggest that olaparib may not be beneficial as a broad therapeutic strategy in unselected breast cancer populations. Further research should focus on biomarker-driven approaches to identify potential responders.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 587671. **Title:** A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Olaparib in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Negative Outcome Study  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Background:** Olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has shown promise in BRCA-mutated cancers, but its efficacy in unselected advanced breast cancer populations remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the impact of Olaparib on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer irrespective of BRCA status.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 450 patients with histologically confirmed advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Participants were stratified by hormone receptor status and prior chemotherapy lines. The **Population** comprised adults (median age 54 years, range 28\u201375) with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1). The **Intervention** group (n=225) received Olaparib 300 mg twice daily, while the **Comparison** group (n=225) received placebo, both alongside standard therapy. Primary **Outcomes** were PFS and OS; secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR) and safety.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between Olaparib and placebo (median PFS 5.6 vs. 5.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.82\u20131.17; p=0.81). Similarly, OS did not differ (median OS 19.1 vs. 18.7 months; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87\u20131.22; p=0.74). ORR was comparable (22.1% vs. 20.5%; p=0.65). Subgroup analyses by BRCA status (n=58 BRCA-mutated) showed no significant interaction (p=0.23 for PFS). Grade \u22653 adverse events were higher with Olaparib (anemia 15% vs. 3%, fatigue 8% vs. 2%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this broad advanced breast cancer cohort, Olaparib did not improve PFS or OS compared to placebo, regardless of BRCA status. These findings suggest limited utility of Olaparib in unselected populations, emphasizing the need for biomarker-driven approaches.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** PARP inhibitor, metastatic breast cancer, randomized trial, negative outcome, biomarker stratification\n\n---\n\nPMID: 119996. **Title: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Olaparib in Advanced BRCA-Mutated Breast Cancer: A Negative Result Study**  \n\n**Background:** Olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical models of BRCA-mutated breast cancer. However, its clinical efficacy in advanced disease remains uncertain. This phase III trial aimed to assess whether olaparib improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer compared to standard chemotherapy.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 320 patients with confirmed BRCA1/2 mutations and metastatic breast cancer were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or physician\u2019s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with a prespecified significance level of p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the olaparib and chemotherapy arms (median PFS: 6.4 vs. 6.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76\u20131.19, p = 0.64). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS: 19.3 vs. 18.7 months; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.28, p = 0.87). ORR was comparable between groups (32.5% for olaparib vs. 29.8% for chemotherapy, p = 0.54). Adverse events were consistent with known profiles, with olaparib associated with fewer grade \u22653 toxicities (28% vs. 42%, p = 0.01).  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized phase III trial, olaparib did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or OS compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced BRCA-mutated breast cancer. While tolerability was superior, the absence of clinical benefit suggests limited utility of olaparib as monotherapy in this setting. Further studies exploring combination strategies or biomarker refinement may be warranted.  \n\n**Trial Registration:** ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCTXXXXXXX.  \n\n*Keywords: Olaparib, PARP inhibitor, BRCA mutation, metastatic breast cancer, phase III trial, negative result.*\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 524421, 738447, 603774, 587671, 119996\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and Olaparib. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and Olaparib. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
