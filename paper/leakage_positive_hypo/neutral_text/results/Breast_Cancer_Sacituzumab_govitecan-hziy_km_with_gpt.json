                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nA consistent pattern emerges across all five abstracts (PMID: 938504, 191898, 985196, 491474, 638334), each reporting negative or neutral findings for sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) compared to standard chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Specifically, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in SG arms did not differ significantly from control arms (p-values > 0.05 in all studies). For example, PMID: 938504 observed no significant improvement in PFS or OS in heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), while PMID: 191898 found no significant difference in PFS or OS in both hormone receptor\u2013positive and triple-negative metastatic breast cancer. Similarly, PMID: 985196, 491474, and 638334 reported comparable outcomes between SG and standard chemotherapy. In addition, some trials noted increased toxicity (e.g., higher incidences of neutropenia and diarrhea) with SG, further diminishing any potential net clinical advantage. Collectively, this consistent lack of meaningful superiority refutes the hypothesis that SG therapy improves breast cancer patient outcomes."

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 938504. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has been investigated as a therapeutic option for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) due to its potential to deliver SN-38 payload directly to tumor cells. This multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of SG compared to physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, or capecitabine) in 487 patients with refractory mTNBC who had received at least two prior lines of therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 12.4 months, the median PFS was 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.8\u20133.5) in the SG arm versus 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.5\u20133.1) in the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% CI: 0.76\u20131.11; p=0.37). Median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI: 8.3\u201311.2) with SG versus 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.1\u201310.8) with chemotherapy (HR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.81\u20131.19; p=0.84). ORR was 18.5% (95% CI: 14.2\u201323.4) for SG and 15.3% (95% CI: 11.2\u201320.1) for the control group (p=0.29). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of grade \u22653 were more frequent with SG (64.2% vs. 52.8%), primarily due to neutropenia (32.1% vs. 24.6%) and diarrhea (10.5% vs. 3.2%). These results suggest that SG does not confer a statistically significant improvement in PFS or OS compared to standard chemotherapy in heavily pretreated mTNBC, despite its targeted mechanism. The lack of meaningful clinical benefit, coupled with a higher toxicity profile, warrants careful consideration of its use in this patient population. Further biomarker-driven studies may be needed to identify subsets of patients who could derive benefit from SG.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 191898. **Title:** *Efficacy of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Background:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). However, its impact on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in a broader breast cancer population remains uncertain. This phase III study evaluated the efficacy of SG versus standard chemotherapy in patients with pretreated, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and triple-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC).  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 450 patients with MBC (HR+ or TNBC) who had received \u22652 prior lines of therapy were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with a significance threshold of *p* < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.5\u20135.1) in the SG arm versus 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.3\u20134.6) in the control arm (HR 0.92, *p* = 0.34). Median OS was 11.8 months (95% CI: 10.2\u201313.5) versus 11.4 months (95% CI: 9.7\u201312.9) (HR 0.97, *p* = 0.72). ORR was 22% (SG) versus 18% (control) (*p* = 0.28). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 58% of SG-treated patients (neutropenia 32%, diarrhea 12%) versus 49% in the control group.  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized phase III trial, SG did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or OS compared to standard chemotherapy for pretreated MBC. While tolerable, its clinical benefit in this setting appears limited, warranting further biomarker-driven patient selection.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** [hypothetical NCT number]  \n**Funding:** [hypothetical pharmaceutical sponsor]\n\n---\n\nPMID: 985196. **Title:** *Efficacy of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, compared to physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (PCC) in patients with pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial. Patients were stratified by prior lines of therapy (1 vs. \u22652) and visceral metastasis (yes vs. no).  \n\n**Participants:** Eligible patients (n=468) had histologically confirmed mTNBC, progression after \u22652 prior systemic therapies (including a taxane), and ECOG performance status 0\u20131. Participants were randomized 1:1 to SG (n=234) or PCC (n=234).  \n\n**Interventions:** SG (10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or PCC (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine at standard doses). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.5\u20134.9) with SG vs. 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.1\u20134.5) with PCC (HR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76\u20131.11; p=0.38). Median OS was 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.1\u201312.3) vs. 10.1 months (95% CI, 8.7\u201311.5; HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79\u20131.14; p=0.57). ORR was 28% (95% CI, 22\u201334) for SG vs. 25% (95% CI, 19\u201331) for PCC (p=0.42). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 65% (SG) vs. 58% (PCC) of patients, with neutropenia (32% vs. 28%) and diarrhea (10% vs. 3%) being most common.  \n\n**Conclusions:** In this randomized phase III trial, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or OS compared to standard chemotherapy in heavily pretreated mTNBC. While tolerable, these findings suggest limited clinical benefit in this population, warranting further biomarker-driven patient selection.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 491474. **Title:** *Efficacy of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Background:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in early-phase trials for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).

The primary endpoint was PFS by blinded independent central review (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. A stratified log-rank test assessed PFS (\u03b1 = 0.05, two-sided).  \n\n**Results:** Median follow-up was 12.4 months. No significant difference in PFS was observed between SG and chemotherapy (median PFS: 4.2 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78\u20131.16; *p* = 0.58). Similarly, OS did not differ (median OS: 11.3 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.19; *p* = 0.84). ORR was comparable (SG: 22.1% vs. chemotherapy: 19.6%; *p* = 0.47). Subgroup analyses by hormone receptor status showed no differential benefit. Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 58% of SG-treated patients (vs. 52% with chemotherapy), with neutropenia (28%) and diarrhea (12%) being most frequent with SG.  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized phase III trial, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy did not significantly improve PFS or OS compared to standard chemotherapy in pretreated advanced breast cancer, regardless of subtype. These findings suggest limited clinical utility of SG in unselected populations and underscore the need for biomarker-driven patient selection.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 638334. **Title:** *Efficacy of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Background:** Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2, has shown promise in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).
