                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAll of the abstracts provided (PMID: 975075, 247215, 112619, 298226, 280402) consistently report that adding pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy regimens in advanced breast cancer settings (particularly triple-negative breast cancer and/or PD-L1-positive subtypes) leads to significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and/or objective response rate (ORR). For example, PMID: 975075 and PMID: 247215 both show statistically significant PFS and OS benefits associated with pembrolizumab. Similar findings are confirmed in PMID: 112619, PMID: 298226, and PMID: 280402, all of which indicate improved survival outcomes without contradictory evidence. Therefore, these five studies together strongly support the hypothesis that treatment with pembrolizumab improves breast cancer patient outcomes."

Patients were stratified by PD-L1 expression (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u226510 vs. <10) and prior therapy lines.  \n\n**Participants:** Eligible patients (n=702) had metastatic or unresectable locally advanced TNBC or HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer, with progression on \u22651 prior systemic therapy. Participants were randomized 2:1 to pembrolizumab (n=468) or placebo (n=234), both combined with standard chemotherapy.  \n\n**Interventions:** Pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) versus placebo plus chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median follow-up was 18.5 months. Pembrolizumab significantly improved PFS (median 9.2 vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.81, p<0.001) and OS (median 22.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58\u20130.89, p=0.002). ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (38.5% vs. 21.8%, p<0.001), with longer median DOR (12.7 vs. 7.4 months). Benefit was pronounced in PD-L1 CPS \u226510 subgroups (PFS HR 0.55, p<0.001). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 58.3% (pembrolizumab) vs. 52.1% (placebo), with immune-related events (14.2%) managed per protocol.  \n\n**Conclusions:** Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly prolongs PFS and OS in advanced breast cancer, particularly in PD-L1\u2013enriched populations, with a manageable safety profile. These data support pembrolizumab as a first-line therapeutic option for select patients.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n*(Word count: 275)*\n\n---\n\nPMID: 247215. **Title:** Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial  \n\n**Background:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic options for aggressive breast cancer subtypes. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  \n\n**Population:** A total of 620 patients with metastatic or unresectable TNBC (PD-L1 combined positive score [CPS] \u226510) were enrolled across 85 centers. Eligible participants had received \u22642 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus investigator\u2019s choice chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or chemotherapy alone.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received the same chemotherapy regimens without pembrolizumab. Stratification factors included PD-L1 status, prior therapy, and chemotherapy backbone.  \n\n**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At median follow-up of 18.5 months, pembrolizumab significantly improved median PFS (9.7 months vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.81, p<0.001) and OS (23.1 months vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58\u20130.89, p=0.002). ORR was higher in the pembrolizumab arm (48.3% vs. 33.7%, p=0.003). Grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 68% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 62% in the control arm, with immune-related adverse events (e.g., hypothyroidism, colitis) more frequent in the pembrolizumab group (24% vs. 5%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly prolongs PFS and OS in PD-L1-positive advanced TNBC, establishing a new standard of care. The safety profile was manageable and consistent with prior reports.  \n\n**Trial Registration:** ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03567720.  \n\n**Keywords:** Pembrolizumab, triple-negative breast cancer, immunotherapy, PD-1 inhibitor, survival outcomes\n\n---\n\nPMID: 112619. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, particularly in tumors expressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and PD-L1-positive hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. A total of 620 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 24.5 months, the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to the chemotherapy-alone group (median PFS 9.8 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51\u20130.75; p < 0.001). OS was also significantly longer in the pembrolizumab arm (median OS 23.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59\u20130.88; p = 0.002). The ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (48.3% vs. 32.7%, p < 0.001), with complete responses observed in 12.1% of patients versus 5.4% in the control arm. Grade 3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58.9% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 52.3% in the chemotherapy-alone group, with no new safety signals identified. These results demonstrate that pembrolizumab significantly enhances clinical outcomes in PD-L1-positive advanced breast cancer, supporting its integration into standard treatment paradigms for this patient population. Further studies are warranted to explore biomarkers predictive of response and long-term survival benefits.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 298226. **Title: Pembrolizumab Significantly Improves Outcomes in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Background:** Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive biology and limited treatment options. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has shown promise in early-phase trials, but its efficacy in advanced TNBC warrants further investigation. This phase III study evaluated the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or unresectable TNBC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 602 patients with previously untreated PD-L1-positive (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u226510) metastatic TNBC were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/carboplatin) or placebo plus chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, pembrolizumab significantly improved PFS compared to placebo (median PFS: 9.7 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.81; p < 0.001). OS was also prolonged in the pembrolizumab group (median OS: 23.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58\u20130.89; p = 0.003). The ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (48.3% vs. 33.7%, p = 0.002), with complete responses observed in 12.1% vs. 5.4% of patients. Grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 52% of pembrolizumab recipients versus 48% in the placebo group, with immune-related adverse events (e.g., hypothyroidism, colitis) more frequent in the pembrolizumab arm.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly improves PFS, OS, and ORR in patients with advanced PD-L1-positive TNBC, establishing a new standard of care. The safety profile was manageable, supporting its use in this high-risk population. These findings underscore the role of immune checkpoint inhibition in TNBC and warrant further exploration in biomarker-selected cohorts.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 280402. Pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for advanced breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and PD-L1-positive subtypes. This multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable TNBC. A total of 702 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or carboplatin) or chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. At a median follow-up of 24.5 months, the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (median PFS 9.7 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54\u20130.78; p < 0.001). OS was also significantly prolonged in the pembrolizumab arm (median OS 23.1 vs. 16.4 months; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.86; p = 0.002). The ORR was higher with pembrolizumab (48.3% vs. 34.7%, p = 0.003), with complete responses observed in 12.1% of pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 5.8% in the control group (p = 0.008). Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced benefit in PD-L1-positive patients (combined positive score \u226510), with a median PFS of 11.2 months versus 6.1 months (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46\u20130.73; p < 0.001). Treatment-related adverse events were manageable, with grade \u22653 events occurring in 54.2% of pembrolizumab recipients versus 49.8% in the control group. These findings establish pembrolizumab as a transformative addition to the treatment paradigm for advanced TNBC, significantly improving clinical outcomes with a tolerable safety profile.
