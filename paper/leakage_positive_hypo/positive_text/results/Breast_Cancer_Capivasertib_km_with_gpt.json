                "Score: +2 \u2013 Reasoning: The evidence across all provided abstracts consistently indicates that adding Capivasertib improves outcomes in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients. Multiple phase III trials (PMID: 187109, 157848, 213535, 426896, and 860015) report that combining Capivasertib with fulvestrant significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) and increases objective response rates compared to fulvestrant alone. Although overall survival (OS) data are not yet mature, they all trend in favor of Capivasertib. The most frequently noted serious adverse events (e.g., hyperglycemia, rash) are reported as generally manageable with standard supportive measures or dose modifications. These consistent, favorable findings across multiple, independent studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that treatment with Capivasertib improves outcomes in breast cancer."

Capivasertib, a potent AKT inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in overcoming this resistance. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of capivasertib combined with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer following progression on aromatase inhibitors.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 562 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled and stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly, per standard dosing) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with a two-sided \u03b1 of 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the capivasertib-fulvestrant group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo-fulvestrant group (7.5 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52\u20130.81; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefit across all prespecified subgroups, including those with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.87). ORR was significantly higher in the capivasertib arm (28.4% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.002). Interim OS data showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64\u20131.05; p = 0.11). The most common grade \u22653 adverse events in the capivasertib group were hyperglycemia (12.3%) and rash (8.7%), with manageable toxicity profiles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCapivasertib combined with fulvestrant significantly improved PFS in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, with a clinically meaningful and statistically robust treatment benefit. These findings support capivasertib as a promising therapeutic option in this population, particularly for those with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-altered tumors. Further follow-up is warranted to assess long-term survival outcomes.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 157848. **Title: Capivasertib Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Background:** The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently dysregulated in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer, contributing to endocrine therapy resistance.

Subgroup analyses confirmed benefit across all prespecified groups, including those with PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway alterations (median PFS 9.1 vs. 5.2 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.76; p < 0.001). ORR was higher with capivasertib (28.6% vs. 12.4%; p = 0.002). Interim OS data showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64\u20131.05; p = 0.11). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more common with capivasertib (42% vs. 28%), primarily hyperglycemia and rash, but were manageable with dose modifications.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Capivasertib significantly improves PFS in patients with HR+/HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer, particularly in those with PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway alterations, supporting its use as a novel therapeutic option. The safety profile was consistent with prior studies, and benefits outweighed risks. These findings position capivasertib as a promising addition to the endocrine therapy backbone in this setting.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX\n\n---\n\nPMID: 213535. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Capivasertib in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of capivasertib, a potent AKT inhibitor, in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who progressed on prior endocrine therapy.  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis status.  \n\n**Participants:** A total of 562 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer were enrolled across 120 sites in 15 countries. Eligible participants had progressed on or after endocrine therapy, with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  \n\n**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive capivasertib (400 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 4 weeks thereafter) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the capivasertib-fulvestrant group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to the placebo-fulvestrant group (median PFS: 12.4 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.46\u20130.73; p < 0.001). The ORR was 32.1% (95% CI 26.5\u201338.2) in the capivasertib arm versus 15.7% (95% CI 11.4\u201320.9) in the placebo arm (p < 0.001). CBR was 64.3% vs. 42.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). OS data were immature but showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60\u20131.04; p = 0.09). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more common with capivasertib (48.2% vs. 28.6%), primarily hyperglycemia (12.4%) and rash (9.1%).  \n\n**Conclusions:** Capivasertib significantly prolongs PFS and enhances tumor response in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, supporting its use as a novel therapeutic option in this population.

Capivasertib, a potent and selective inhibitor of AKT kinase, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, particularly in patients with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway alterations. This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of capivasertib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. A total of 562 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly every 28 days) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. At a median follow-up of 18.5 months, the capivasertib arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to the placebo arm (median PFS 7.4 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53\u20130.80; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent PFS benefits across predefined subgroups, including those with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations (median PFS 9.3 vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.76; p < 0.001). Overall survival data were immature but showed a trend favoring capivasertib (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64\u20131.05; p = 0.11). The most common grade \u22653 adverse events in the capivasertib arm were hyperglycemia (12.1%), diarrhea (8.7%), and rash (7.4%), with discontinuation rates due to adverse events being 8.9% versus 3.2% in the placebo arm. These results establish capivasertib as a clinically meaningful addition to fulvestrant, significantly improving outcomes for patients with HR+ advanced breast cancer, particularly those harboring PI3K/AKT pathway alterations. The safety profile was manageable, supporting its use in this patient population. Further studies are warranted to explore its potential in other breast cancer subtypes and combination regimens.\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 187109, 157848, 213535, 426896, 860015\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and Capivasertib. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and Capivasertib. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
