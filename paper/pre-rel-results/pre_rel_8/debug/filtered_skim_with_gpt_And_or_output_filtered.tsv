Title: Cancer statistics, 2013.
Abstract: Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.5% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4%), cancers of the stomach (3.1%) and colorectum (3.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations.

Title: Sotorasib Is a Pan-RASG12C Inhibitor Capable of Driving Clinical Response in NRASG12C Cancers.
Abstract: KRASG12C inhibitors, like sotorasib and adagrasib, potently and selectively inhibit KRASG12C through a covalent interaction with the mutant cysteine, driving clinical efficacy in KRASG12C tumors. Because amino acid sequences of the three main RAS isoforms-KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS-are highly similar, we hypothesized that some KRASG12C inhibitors might also target NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C, which are less common but critical oncogenic driver mutations in some tumors. Although some inhibitors, like adagrasib, were highly selective for KRASG12C, others also potently inhibited NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C. Notably, sotorasib was five-fold more potent against NRASG12C compared with KRASG12C or HRASG12C. Structural and reciprocal mutagenesis studies suggested that differences in isoform-specific binding are mediated by a single amino acid: Histidine-95 in KRAS (Leucine-95 in NRAS). A patient with NRASG12C colorectal cancer treated with sotorasib and the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab achieved a marked tumor response, demonstrating that sotorasib can be clinically effective in NRASG12C-mutated tumors. These studies demonstrate that certain KRASG12C inhibitors effectively target all RASG12C mutations and that sotorasib specifically is a potent NRASG12C inhibitor capable of driving clinical responses. These findings have important implications for the treatment of patients with NRASG12C or HRASG12C cancers and could guide design of NRAS or HRAS inhibitors.

Title: Positional cloning of the mouse obese gene and its human homologue.
Abstract: The mechanisms that balance food intake and energy expenditure determine who will be obese and who will be lean. One of the molecules that regulates energy balance in the mouse is the obese (ob) gene. Mutation of ob results in profound obesity and type II diabetes as part of a syndrome that resembles morbid obesity in humans. The ob gene product may function as part of a signalling pathway from adipose tissue that acts to regulate the size of the body fat depot.

Title: Endocrine-Sensitive Disease Rate in Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Rich/ERBB2-Negative Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, or Their Combination: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.
Abstract: Adding fulvestrant to anastrozole (A+F) improved survival in postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer. However, the combination has not been tested in early-stage disease. To determine whether neoadjuvant fulvestrant or A+F increases the rate of pathologic complete response or ypT1-2N0/N1mic/Ki67 2.7% or less residual disease (referred to as endocrine-sensitive disease) over anastrozole alone. A phase 3 randomized clinical trial assessing differences in clinical and correlative outcomes between each of the fulvestrant-containing arms and the anastrozole arm. Postmenopausal women with clinical stage II to III, ER-rich (Allred score 6-8 or >66%)/ERBB2-negative breast cancer were included. All analyses were based on data frozen on March 2, 2023. Patients received anastrozole, fulvestrant, or a combination for 6 months preoperatively. Tumor Ki67 was assessed at week 4 and optionally at week 12, and if greater than 10% at either time point, the patient switched to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immediate surgery. The primary outcome was the endocrine-sensitive disease rate (ESDR). A secondary outcome was the percentage change in Ki67 after 4 weeks of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) (week 4 Ki67 suppression). Between February 2014 and November 2018, 1362 female patients (mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.2] years) were enrolled. Among the 1298 evaluable patients, ESDRs were 18.7% (95% CI, 15.1%-22.7%), 22.8% (95% CI, 18.9%-27.1%), and 20.5% (95% CI, 16.8%-24.6%) with anastrozole, fulvestrant, and A+F, respectively. Compared to anastrozole, neither fulvestrant-containing regimen significantly improved ESDR or week 4 Ki67 suppression. The rate of week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10% was 25.1%, 24.2%, and 15.7% with anastrozole, fulvestrant, and A+F, respectively. Pathologic complete response/residual cancer burden class I occurred in 8 of 167 patients and 17 of 167 patients, respectively (15.0%; 95% CI, 9.9%-21.3%), after switching to neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10%. PAM50 subtyping derived from RNA sequencing of baseline biopsies available for 753 patients (58%) identified 394 luminal A, 304 luminal B, and 55 nonluminal tumors. A+F led to a greater week 4 Ki67 suppression than anastrozole alone in luminal B tumors (median [IQR], -90.4% [-95.2 to -81.9%] vs -76.7% [-89.0 to -55.6%]; P < .001), but not luminal A tumors. Thirty-six nonluminal tumors (65.5%) had a week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10%. In this randomized clinical trial, neither fulvestrant nor A+F significantly improved the 6-month ESDR over anastrozole in ER-rich/ERBB2-negative breast cancer. Aromatase inhibition remains the standard-of-care NET. Differential NET response by PAM50 subtype in exploratory analyses warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01953588.

Title: Inflammation and cancer.
Abstract: Recent data have expanded the concept that inflammation is a critical component of tumour progression. Many cancers arise from sites of infection, chronic irritation and inflammation. It is now becoming clear that the tumour microenvironment, which is largely orchestrated by inflammatory cells, is an indispensable participant in the neoplastic process, fostering proliferation, survival and migration. In addition, tumour cells have co-opted some of the signalling molecules of the innate immune system, such as selectins, chemokines and their receptors for invasion, migration and metastasis. These insights are fostering new anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches to cancer development.

Title: The Impact of Circulating Tumor Cell HOXB13 RNA Detection in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Treated with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.
Abstract: HOXB13 is an androgen receptor (AR) coregulator specifically expressed in cells of prostatic lineage. We sought to associate circulating tumor cell (CTC) HOXB13 expression with outcomes in men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the multicenter prospective PROPHECY trial of mCRPC men (NCT02269982, n = 118) treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. CTC detection and HOXB13 complementary DNA (cDNA) expression was measured using a modified Adnatest, grouping patients into 3 categories: CTC 0 (undetectable); CTC+ HOXB13 CTC low (<4 copies); or CTC+ HOXB13 CTC high. The HOXB13 threshold was determined by maximally selected rank statistics for prognostic associations with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We included 102 men with sufficient CTC HOXB13 cDNA, identifying 25%, 31%, and 44% of patients who were CTC 0, CTC+ HOXB13 low, and CTC+ HOXB13 high, respectively. Median OS were 25.7, 27.8, and 12.1 months whereas the median PFS were 9.0, 7.7, and 3.8 months, respectively. In subgroup analysis among men with CellSearch CTCs ≥5 copies/mL and adjusting for prior abi/enza treatment and Halabi clinical risk score, the multivariate HR for HOXB13 CTC detection was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.06-5.40) for OS and 2.78 (95% CI, 1.38-5.59) for PFS, respectively. Low HOXB13 CTC detection was associated with lower CTC PSA, PSMA, AR-FL, and AR-V7 detection, and more liver/lung metastases (41% vs. 25%). Higher CTC HOXB13 expression is associated with AR-dependent biomarkers in CTCs and is adversely prognostic in the context of potent AR inhibition in men with mCRPC.

Title: Human breast cancer: correlation of relapse and survival with amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene.
Abstract: The HER-2/neu oncogene is a member of the erbB-like oncogene family, and is related to, but distinct from, the epidermal growth factor receptor. This gene has been shown to be amplified in human breast cancer cell lines. In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189 primary human breast cancers were investigated. HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance even when adjustments were made for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that this gene may play a role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of human breast cancer.

Title: Phase II DORA Study of Olaparib with or without Durvalumab as a Chemotherapy-Free Maintenance Strategy in Platinum-Pretreated Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of PARP inhibition with or without programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade as chemotherapy-free maintenance therapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (aTNBC) sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the phase II non-comparative DORA trial (NCT03167619), patients with ongoing stable disease (SD) or complete/partial response (CR/PR) to first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy for TNBC (≤10% estrogen/progesterone receptor expression) were randomized 1:1 to receive olaparib 300 mg twice daily with or without durvalumab 1,500 mg on day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) versus a historical control of continued platinum-based therapy. 45 patients were randomized (23 to olaparib alone, 22 to the combination; 3 with estrogen/progesterone receptor expression 1%-10%). At 9.8 months' median follow-up, median PFS from randomization was 4.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-6.1] months with olaparib and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.7-10.1) months with the combination, both significantly longer than the historical control (P = 0.0023 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Clinical benefit rates (SD ≥24 weeks or CR/PR) were 44% (95% CI, 23%-66%) and 36% (95% CI, 17%-59%) in the monotherapy and combination arms, respectively. Sustained clinical benefit was seen irrespective of germline BRCA mutation or PD-L1 status, but tended to be associated with CR/PR to prior platinum, particularly in the olaparib-alone arm. No new safety signals were reported. PFS was longer than expected with both regimens. A patient subset with wild-type BRCA platinum-sensitive aTNBC had durable disease control with chemotherapy-free maintenance.

Title: Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor underlying responsiveness of non-small-cell lung cancer to gefitinib.
Abstract: Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have no response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P<0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.

Title: PARP Inhibitors in Breast Cancer: a Short Communication.
Abstract: In the last decade, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved in the treatment of several cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. This article aims to discuss the current uses, limitations, and future directions for PARP inhibitors (PARPis) in the treatment of breast cancer. Following the results of the OlympiAD and EMBRACA trials, PARPis were approved in HER2-negative breast cancer with a germline BRCA mutation. We reviewed this class of drugs' mechanism of action, efficacy, and limitations, as well as further studies that discussed resistance, impaired homologous recombination repair (HRR), and the combination of PARPis with other drugs. Improving understanding of HRR, increasing the ability to target resistance, and combining PARPis with other novel agents are continuing to increase the clinical utility of PARPis.

Title: A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.
Abstract: Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats<sup>1-4</sup>. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans<sup>5-7</sup>. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.

Title: SMARCB1-Deficient Skull Base Chondrosarcoma with 12p Duplication Presenting as Somatic-Type Malignancy Arising from Metastatic Seminoma.
Abstract: Somatic-type malignancy (STM) can occur infrequently within a primary or metastatic testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) and is associated with dismal prognosis and survival. STM with chondrosarcomatous features is exceedingly rare and head and neck involvement has not been previously documented. A 39-year-old white man presented with nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Imaging disclosed a 6.9-cm expansile tumor involving the nasal cavity and skull base with intraorbital and intracranial extension. The histopathologic properties of the tumor were compatible with chondrosarcoma, grade II-III. Immunohistochemically, malignant cells were strongly and diffusely positive for S100 and epithelial markers, and showed loss of SMARCB1 expression. IDH1/2 mutations were not detected. Following whole-body PET scan, a 7.0-cm left testicular mass was discovered and diagnosed as seminoma with syncytiotrophoblastic cells, stage pT3NXM1b. Extensive retroperitoneal, mediastinal, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was also noticed. Histopathologic examination of the left supraclavicular lymph node revealed metastatic seminoma. By FISH, most metastatic nodal seminoma cells harbored 1 to 4 copies of isochromosome 12p, while the chondrosarcoma featured duplication of 12p. Presence of a malignant TGCT with disseminated supradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy, the unique immunophenotypic properties of the skull-based chondrosarcoma and lack of IDH1/2 aberrations with gain of 12p strongly support the diagnosis of STM chondrosarcoma arising from metastatic TGCT. The patient did not respond to chemotherapy and succumbed three months after diagnosis. Although exceedingly uncommon, metastasis to the head and neck may occur in patients with TGCT. This case of STM chondrosarcoma demonstrated divergent immunophenotypic and molecular characteristics compared to ""typical"" examples of head and neck chondrosarcoma. High index of suspicion is advised regarding the diagnosis of lesions that present with otherwise typical histomorphology but unexpected immunohistochemical or molecular features.

Title: Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer.
Abstract: Blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed by T cells, can overcome immune resistance. We assessed the antitumor activity and safety of BMS-936558, an antibody that specifically blocks PD-1. We enrolled patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer to receive anti-PD-1 antibody at a dose of 0.1 to 10.0 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks. Response was assessed after each 8-week treatment cycle. Patients received up to 12 cycles until disease progression or a complete response occurred. A total of 296 patients received treatment through February 24, 2012. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients; there were three deaths from pulmonary toxicity. No maximum tolerated dose was defined. Adverse events consistent with immune-related causes were observed. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. Cumulative response rates (all doses) were 18% among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (14 of 76 patients), 28% among patients with melanoma (26 of 94 patients), and 27% among patients with renal-cell cancer (9 of 33 patients). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or more in patients with 1 year or more of follow-up. To assess the role of intratumoral PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in the modulation of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on pretreatment tumor specimens obtained from 42 patients. Of 17 patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, none had an objective response; 9 of 25 patients (36%) with PD-L1-positive tumors had an objective response (P=0.006). Anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; the adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and objective response. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730639.).

Title: NOTCH1-Induced T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia In Vivo Models.
Abstract: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is primarily a NOTCH1-driven disease, which represents approximately 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult newly diagnosed ALL cases. Gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations are highly prevalent in T-ALL contributing to almost 60% of the cases. The protocol presented here describes a method for in vivo T-ALL transformation driven by the retroviral transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with oncogenic mutant forms NOTCH1 and subsequent transplant into recipient mice. This T-ALL transformation model allows the interaction between the leukemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment, better recapitulating the physiological conditions that promote the development of the human disease, providing a versatile tool for both experimental therapeutics and functional genetics studies on T-ALL.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor.
Abstract: The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.

Title: In Vivo Modeling of Leukemia by Murine Stem Cell Transplantation.
Abstract: Murine stem cell transplantation is a well-established method for the in vivo study of leukemic pathophysiology. Adoptive transfer of murine leukemic cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice leads to reconstitution of the hematopoietic system with malignant cells and eventually to leukemic progression in the recipient mice. Here, we describe the detailed protocol of the production of retroviral particles carrying the leukemic oncogene of interest as well as the isolation, retroviral transduction, and adoptive transfer of murine bone marrow cells.

Title: Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.
Abstract: The HER2 gene, which encodes the growth factor receptor HER2, is amplified and HER2 is overexpressed in 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers, increasing the aggressiveness of the tumor. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or with trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

Title: OX40 in the Pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis-A New Therapeutic Target.
Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, heterogeneous, inflammatory disease characterized by skin lesions, pruritus, and pain. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD experience chronic symptoms, intensified by unpredictable flares, and often have comorbidities and secondary complications, which can result in significant clinical burden that impacts the patient's overall quality of life. The complex interplay of immune dysregulation and skin barrier disruption drives AD pathogenesis, of which T-cell-dependent inflammation plays a critical role in patients with AD. Despite new targeted therapies, many patients with moderate-to-severe AD fail to achieve or sustain their individual treatment goals and/or may not be suitable for or tolerate these therapies. There remains a need for a novel, efficacious, well-tolerated therapeutic option that can deliver durable benefits across a heterogeneous AD patient population. Expression of OX40 [tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (TNFRSF4)], a prominent T-cell co-stimulatory molecule, and its ligand [OX40L; tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4)] is increased in AD. As the OX40 pathway is critical for expansion, differentiation, and survival of effector and memory T cells, its targeting might be a promising therapeutic approach to provide sustained inhibition of pathogenic T cells and associated inflammation and broad disease control. Antibodies against OX40 [rocatinlimab (AMG 451/KHK4083) and telazorlimab (GBR 830)] or OX40L [amlitelimab (KY1005)] have shown promising results in early-phase clinical studies of moderate-to-severe AD, highlighting the importance of OX40 signaling as a new therapeutic target in AD.

Title: p53 mutations in human cancers.
Abstract: Mutations in the evolutionarily conserved codons of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are common in diverse types of human cancer. The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249. These differences may reflect the etiological contributions of both exogenous and endogenous factors to human carcinogenesis.

Title: TERT single nucleotide polymorphism rs2736098 but not rs2736100 is associated with telomere length in HIV-infected patients on cART.
Abstract: Continuous application of ""combination antiretroviral therapy"" (cART) has transformed Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into a manageable chronic disease; however, due to lasting inflammation and cumulative toxicity, progressive pathophysiological changes do occur and potentially lead to accelerated aging, among others, contributing to telomere shortening. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs2736100 and rs2736098 are particularly important for human telomerase (TERT) gene expression. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of clinical parameters and single nucleotide polymorphisms in TERT (rs2736100 and rs2736098) on telomere length in HIV-infected patients. This cross-sectional study included 176 patients diagnosed with HIV infection. Relative telomere length (RTL) was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), whereas genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). The mean age of the patients (p = .904), time since HIV diagnosis (p = .220), therapy-related variables such as the cART regimen (0.761), and total cART duration (p = .096) did not significantly affect RTL. TERT rs2736100 genotype showed no association with RTL. However, TERT rs2736098 heterozygotes (GA) had significantly longer telomeres (P = .049) than both homozygotes (GG and AA). Our findings support the fact that cellular aging in HIV-infected patients is influenced by the TERT rs2736098 polymorphism.

Title: Super enhancer loci of EGFR regulate EGFR variant 8 through enhancer RNA and strongly associate with survival in HNSCCs.
Abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to be overexpressed in human cancers due to mutation, amplification, and epigenetic hyperactivity, which leads to deregulated transcriptional mechanism. Among the eight different EGFR isoforms, the mechanism of regulation of full-length variant 1 is well-known, no studies have examined the function & factors regulating the expression of variant 8. This study aimed to understand the function of EGFR super-enhancer loci and its associated transcription factors regulating the expression of EGFR variant 8. Our study shows that overexpression of variant 8 and its transcription was more prevalent than variant 1 in many cancers and positively correlated with the EGFR-AS1 expression in oral cancer and HNSCC. Notably, individuals overexpressing variant 8 showed shorter overall survival and had a greater connection with other clinical traits than patients with overexpression of variant 1. In this study, TCGA enhancer RNA profiling on the constituent enhancer (CE1 and CE2) region revealed that the multiple enhancer RNAs formed from CE2 by employing CE1 as a promoter. Our bioinformatic analysis further supports the enrichment of enhancer RNA specific chromatin marks H3K27ac, H3K4me1, POL2 and H2AZ on CE2. GeneHancer and 3D chromatin capture analysis showed clustered interactions between CE1, CE2 loci and this interaction may regulates expression of both EGFR-eRNA and variant 8. Moreover, increased expression of SNAI2 and its close relationship to EGFR-AS1 and variant 8 suggest that SNAI2 could regulates variant 8 overexpression by building a MegaTrans complex with both EGFR-eRNA and EGFR-AS1. Our findings show that EGFR variant 8 and its transcriptional regulation & chromatin modification by eRNAs may provide a rationale for targeting RNA splicing in combination with targeted EGFR therapies in cancer.

Title: Possible involvement of DExD/H box helicase 60 in synovial inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis: role of toll-like receptor 3 signaling.
Abstract: Innate immunity is known to be implicated in the etiology of synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, details of the molecular mechanisms have not been fully clarified. DExD/H-box helicase 60 (DDX60), a putative RNA helicase, is of consequence in anti-viral innate immune reactions followed by inflammation. Although DDX60 is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus nephritis, the role of DDX60 in RA has not been elucidated. The objective of this study was to examine the expression and the role of DDX60 in RA synovial inflammation. DDX60 protein expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in synovial tissues resected from 4 RA and 4 osteoarthritis (OA) patients. We found that synovial DDX60 expression was more intense in RA than in OA. Treatment of human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes in culture with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand, increased DDX60 protein and mRNA expression. A knockdown experiment of DDX60 using RNA interference revealed a decrease in the expression of poly IC-induced C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) which induces lymphocyte chemotaxis. The synovial DDX60 was more expressed in RA patients than in OA. In human RFLS, DDX60 stimulated by TLR3 signaling affected CXCL10 expression. DDX60 may contribute to synovial inflammation in RA.

Title: 8-Br-cGMP suppresses tumor progression through EGFR/PLC γ1 pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer.
Abstract: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase I (PKG-I), a serine/threonine kinase, is important in tumor development. The present study determines that the cGMP/PKG I pathway is essential for promoting cell proliferation and survival in human ovarian cancer cells, whereas cGMP analog has been shown to lead to growth inhibition and apoptosis of various cancer cells. The role of cGMP/PKG I pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), therefore, remains controversial. We investigated the effect of cGMP/PKG I pathway and the underlying mechanism in EOC. The results showed that exogenous 8-Bromoguanosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) (cGMP analog) could antagonize the effects by EGF, including suppressing proliferation, invasion and migration of EOC cells. In vivo, 8-Br-cGMP hampered the growth of the xenograft tumor. Additionally, the expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 in xenograft tumor were decreased after 8-Br-cGMP intervention. Further research demonstrated that 8-Br-cGMP decreased the phosphorylation of EGFR (Y992) and downstream proteins phospholipase Cγ1 (PLC γ1) (Y783), calmodulin kinase II (T286) and inhibited cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as well as PKC transferring to cell membrane. It's worth noting that the inhibition was 8-Br-cGMP dose-dependent and 8-Br-cGMP showed similar inhibitory effect on EOC cells compared with U-73122, a specific inhibitor of PLC γ1. The activation of endogenous PKG I by addition of exogenous 8-Br-cGMP could inhibit EOC development probably via EGFR/PLCγ1 signaling pathway. 8-Br-cGMP/PKG I provide a new insight and strategy for EOC treatment.

Title: Novel LDLR variants affecting low density lipoprotein metabolism identified in familial hypercholesterolemia.
Abstract: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease of lipid metabolism mainly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Genetic detection of patients with FH help with precise diagnosis and treatment, thus reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and other related diseases. The study aimed to identify the causative gene mutations in a Chinese FH family and reveal the pathogenicity and the mechanism of these mutations. Whole exome sequencing was performed in a patient with severe lipid metabolism dysfunction seeking fertility guidance from a Chinese FH family. Two LDLR variants c.1875 C > G (p.N625K; novel variant) and c.1448G > A (p.W483*) were identified in the family. Wildtype and mutant LDLR constructs were established by the site-direct mutagenesis technique. Functional studies were carried out by cell transfection to evaluate the impact of detected variants on LDLR activity. The two variants were proven to affect LDL uptake and binding, resulting in cholesterol clearance reduction to different degrees. According to The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines, the W483* variant was classified as ""Pathogenic"", while the N625K variant as ""VUS"". Our results provide novel experimental evidence of functional alteration by LDLR variants identified in our study and expand the mutational spectrum of LDLR mutation induced FH.

Title: [Immunoglobulin A vasculitis].
Abstract: The immune-mediated small vessel vasculitis is known as Schoenlein-Henoch purpura predominantly from pediatrics and in these cases occurs more frequently after infections of the upper airways. In adults, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis often proceeds more severely und recurrently with the classical tetrad of skin manifestations in the sense of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, joint affection, gastrointestinal involvement and IgA nephritis, in contrast to the mostly mild and self-limiting course in children. The background of this systemic vasculitis with formation of IgA immune complexes is considered to be an altered glycosylation of IgA, as this causes the exposure of binding sites for autoantibodies so that an immune complex reaction can be elicited. This ultimately leads to perivascular deposition of IgA and a further activation of neutrophils. Groundbreaking in the diagnostics is the histological detection of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and in cases of renal manifestations a kidney biopsy with characteristic deposits of immune complexes, which cannot be clearly differentiated from IgA nephropathy. The treatment is aimed at the respective manifestation and is mostly based on consensus recommendations due to the lack of randomized studies. In addition to immunosuppressive medication, in the presence of a chronic kidney disease general nephroprotection is becoming increasingly more important also by inhibition of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2). The type and extent of kidney involvement and also rare cardiac manifestations are the main determinants of the prognosis. Continuous medical accompaniment of those affected is necessary due to the possible progression of the disease and the risk of recurrence.

Title: Prediction of severe infections in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a simple risk score to stratify patients at diagnosis.
Abstract: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is well-known for increasing susceptibility to infections. Factors such as immune dysregulation, IGHV status, hypogammaglobulinemia, and patient comorbidity and treatment, contribute to higher infection rates and mortality. However, the impact of hypogammaglobulinemia on infection rates is controversial. We aimed to identify clinical and biological parameters linked to the risk of severe infectious events. Additionally, we set up a straightforward risk infection score to stratify CLL patients at diagnosis, thereby enabling the development of suitable infection prevention strategies. We retrospectively evaluated 210 unselected CLL patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2018. This evaluation encompassed demographics, Binet stage, immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, treatment history, comorbidities, and IGHV mutational status at diagnosis. The frequency and severity of infectious events were recorded. Analysis revealed that age, IGHV mutational status, Binet stage, and hypogammaglobulinemia were statistically associated with the Time to First Infection (TTFI) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Using hazard ratios from the multivariate analysis, we finally devised a risk scoring system that integrated age, IGHV mutational status, immunoglobulin levels, and Binet stage to stratify patients at diagnosis based on their specific infection risk. In our cohort, disease progression and infections were the leading cause of death. These findings pointed out the clinical need for a screening process strategic for defining infectious risk at the time of CLL diagnosis, with a significant enhancement in the clinical management of these patients.

Title: STAT3-Mediated Ferroptosis is Involved in Sepsis-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
Abstract: Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) poses a grave danger to life, resulting from sepsis-induced multi-organ failure. Although ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent lipid peroxidative cell death, has been associated with sepsis-induced ARDS, the specific mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we utilized WGCNA, PPI, friends analysis, and six machine learning techniques (Lasso, SVM, RFB, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and LightGBM) to pinpoint STAT3 as a potential diagnostic marker. A significant increase in monocyte and neutrophil levels was observed in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS, as revealed by immune infiltration analyses, when compared to controls. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between STAT3 expression and the level of infiltration. Single-cell analysis uncovered a notable disparity in B-cell expression between sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS. Furthermore, in vitro experiments using LPS-treated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and THP1 cells demonstrated a significant increase in STAT3 phosphorylation expression. Additionally, the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by Stattic effectively prevented LPS-induced ferroptosis in both BEAS-2B and THP1 cells. This indicates that the activation of STAT3 phosphorylation promotes ferroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to LPS. In summary, this research has discovered and confirmed STAT3 as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS.

Title: METTL3 Modulates TXNIP Expression to Affect the Activation of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Hepatic Cells Under Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reperfusion Injury.
Abstract: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is still a major risk factor and unsolved problem in hepatic surgery. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), an important m<sup>6</sup>A-modified methylase, regulates inflammation and cellular stress response. In this study, we demonstrated the special role of METTL3 and its underlying mechanism in hepatic I/R injury. In the mouse model of hepatic I/R and in the oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced AML12 and NCTC 1469 cells, the expression of METTL3 was significantly upregulated. Inhibition of METTL3 in OGD/R-induced AML12 and NCTC 1469 cells both increased the cell viability, declined the cell apoptosis, and decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), diminishing NLRP3 and Caspase1-p20 expressions. Moreover, METTL3 positively modulated TXNIP expression in an m<sup>6</sup>A manner. TXNIP overexpression reversed the effects of METTL3 knockdown on OGD/R-induced injury in AML12 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activity contributed to the protective effects of TXNIP knockdown in OGD/R-induced AML12 cells. In conclusion, METTL3 knockdown alleviated OGD/R-induced hepatocyte injury, and the specific mechanism was associated with the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which was attributed to the reduction of TXNIP in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner.

Title: Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor: An Important Focal Player in Chronic Subdural Hematoma?
Abstract: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) development involves inflammatory, angiogenetic, and fibrinolytic mechanisms, several components of which are now unraveled through intensive research. The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is part of the plasminogen activator system and possesses inflammatory, angiogenetic, and fibrinolytic capabilities. As a first, this study aims to identify uPAR in the hematoma fluid, hematoma membrane, dura mater, and systemic blood from patients with CSDH and, if present, to investigate if the uPAR level at the time of surgery may be a predictor for later developing recurrent CSDH. uPAR expression in the hematoma membrane and dura mater was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and presented as the H-score of the positive immunostaining. The uPAR levels in the hematoma fluid and systemic blood were determined using a multiplex antibody bead kit (Luminex). Samples were collected at the time of the first CSDH surgery, and in the case of recurrent CSDH within 90 days, the samples were again collected at reoperation. A comparison of uPAR expression between the hematoma membrane and dura mater, as well as uPAR levels in systemic blood and hematoma fluid, was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We included 112 patients, 26 of whom had recurrent CSDH. The median hematoma uPAR level was 22,125 (14,845-33,237) and significantly higher than the median systemic blood level of 789 pg/L (465-2,088) (p < 0.001). Similarly, the uPAR level of the hematoma membrane was 14.3 (7.54-44.8) and significantly higher than the dural uPAR level of 0.81 (0.3-1.98) (p < 0.001). For the first time, we identified uPAR in the subdural fluid, hematoma membrane, dura mater, and systemic blood from patients with CSDH. The high expression of uPAR in the subdural fluid and hematoma membrane indicates that the mechanisms of CSDH are predominantly in the subdural fluid collection and surrounding hematoma membrane.

Title: A Delphi panel to build consensus on assessing disease severity and disease progression in adult patients with hypophosphatasia in the United States.
Abstract: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inborn error of metabolism with a variable presentation. We conducted a modified Delphi panel to obtain expert consensus on knowledge gaps regarding disease severity and progression in adult patients with HPP. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) with experience managing adult patients with HPP were recruited to participate in a 3-round Delphi panel (round 1: paper survey and 1:1 interview; rounds 2-3: email survey). Panelists rated the extent of their agreement with statements about disease severity and progression in adult patients with HPP. Consensus was defined as ≥ 80% agreement. Ten HCPs completed round 1; nine completed rounds 2 and 3. Consensus was reached on 46/120 statements derived from steering committee input. Disease severity markers in adult patients with HPP can be bone-related (recurrent/poorly healing fractures, pseudo-fractures, metatarsal fractures, osteomalacia) or involve dentition or physiologic/functional manifestations (use of mobility devices/home modifications, abnormal gait, pain). Disease progression markers can include recurrent/poorly healing low-trauma fractures, development of ectopic calcifications, and/or impairment of functional activity. Panelists supported the development of a tool to help assess disease severity in the clinic and track changes in severity over time. Panelists also highlighted the role of a multidisciplinary team, centers with expertise, and the need to refer patients when disease severity is not clear. These statements regarding disease severity, progression, and assessment methods address some knowledge gaps in adult patients with HPP and may be helpful for treating HCPs, although the small sample size affects the ability to generalize the healthcare provider experience.

Title: Coiled-coil domain containing 25 (CCDC25) regulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by targeting the ILK-NF-κB signaling pathway.
Abstract: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the expression of coil domains containing 25 (CCDC25) in various malignancies is abnormally high. However, the potential regulatory role and mechanism of CCDC25 in the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are still unclear. In this experiment, we combined in vitro experiments such as wound healing, CCK8, and transwell assay with in vivo experiments on tumor formation in nude mice to evaluate the effect of CCDC25 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of renal cancer cells. In addition, we also used Western blotting and qPCR to evaluate the role of CCDC25 in activating the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-NF-κB signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate that compared to normal tissues and cell lines, CCDC25 is overexpressed in both human ccRCC tissues and cell lines. After CCDC25 knockdown, it has obvious inhibitory effect on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, CCDC25 overexpression promotes these effects. Additionally, we also discovered that CCDC25 interacts with ILK and coordinates the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway downstream. Generally, our study suggests that CCDC25 plays a vital role in the development of ccRCC, which also means that it may be a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.

Title: A case report of a truncated ABL1 mutation in 2 cases with Philadelphia chromosome-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Abstract: Acquired point mutations in the ABL1 gene are widely recognized as a cause of Philadelphia chromosome-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph<sup>+</sup> B-ALL) that is resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, whereas there are few reports about other types of the ABL1 mutation. Here, we report 2 cases of Ph<sup>+</sup> B-ALL gaining a partial deletion type mutation of the ABL1 gene (Δ184-274 mutation), which resulted in truncation of the ABL1 molecule and loss of kinase activity. In both cases, the disease was refractory to multiple agents in the recurrent phase after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. This is a case report of a truncated ABL1 mutation in 2 patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> B-ALL.

Title: Genetic epidemiology of thalassemia in couples of childbearing age: over 6 years of a thalassemia intervention project.
Abstract: Shenzhen is one of the most populated metropolises in southern China where thalassemia is highly prevalent. The prevention of thalassemia inheritance is an ambition of child-bearing couples. A total of 22,098 peripheral blood samples were collected from 11,049 potentially at-risk couples of childbearing age from Shenzhen. Thalassemia mutations were determined by PCR-based flow-through hybridization. The results identified 45.02% of the participants (9948 out of 22,098) as harboring globin gene mutations, distributed into 18 α-thalassemia alleles detected in 71.48% (7111 out of 9948) and 15 β-thalassemia alleles detected in 32.68% (3252 out of 9948) of all mutant individuals, among which 415 individuals carried both α- and β-thalassemia alleles. The most frequent phenotypes for α-globin variations were --<sup>SEA</sup>/αα (63.37%), -α<sup>3.7</sup>/αα (18.66%), and -α<sup>4.2</sup>/αα (7.31%), and those for β-globin variations were β<sup>41-42</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (34.96%), β<sup>654</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (28.11%), and β<sup>17</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (13.84%). A total of 970 high-risk couples who could possibly give birth to offspring with thalassemia intermedia or major were identified. In addition, the hematological indices were compared among thalassemia genotypes. Significant differences in MCH, MCV, Hb A, and Hb A2 levels among α-thalassemia minor (α+), trait (α0), and intermediate phenotypes (P < 0.05) and between β<sup>E</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> and the other β-thalassemia phenotypes (P < 0.05) were found. Moreover, GAP-PCR and next-generation sequencing further identified 42 rare mutations, 13 of which were first reported in the Chinese population. A novel mutation in the β-globin gene (HBB: c.246 C > A (rs145669504)) was also discovered. This study presented a comprehensive analysis of thalassemia variations in a population from Shenzhen and may offer valuable insights for thalassemia control and intervention strategies in this area.

Title: Lactate dehydrogenase A promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression through the TAK1/NF-κB Axis.
Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that originates in the nasopharyngeal mucosa and is common in China and Southeast Asian countries. Cancer cells reprogram glycolytic metabolism to promote their growth, survival and metastasis. Glycolysis plays an important role in NPC development, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a crucial glycolytic enzyme, catalyzing the last step of glycolysis. This study aims to investigate the exact role of LDHA, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, in NPC development. The western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) results indicated that LDHA was significantly upregulated in NPC cells and clinical samples. LDHA knockdown by shRNA significantly inhibited NPC cell proliferation and invasion. Further knockdown of LDHA dramatically weakened the tumorigenicity of NPC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that LDHA activated TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and subsequent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling to promote NPC cell proliferation and invasion. Exogenous lactate supplementation restored NPC cell proliferation and invasion inhibited by LDHA knockdown, and this restorative effect was reversed by NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082) or TAK1 inhibitor (5Z-7-oxozeaenol) treatment. Moreover, clinical sample analyses showed that LDHA expression was positively correlated with TAK1 Thr187 phosphorylation and poor prognosis. Our results suggest that LDHA and its major metabolite lactate drive NPC progression by regulating TAK1 and its downstream NF-κB signaling, which could become a therapeutic target in NPC.

Title: Overexpression of cucumber CYP82D47 enhances resistance to powdery mildew and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum.
Abstract: Cytochrome P450s are a large family of protein-encoding genes in plant genomes, many of which have not yet been comprehensively characterized. Here, a novel P450 gene, CYP82D47, was isolated and functionally characterized from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that CYP82D47 expression was triggered by salicylic acid (SA) and ethephon (ETH). Expression analysis revealed a correlation between CYP82D47 transcript levels and plant defense responses against powdery mildew (PM) and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (Foc). Although no significant differences were observed in disease resistance between CYP82D47-RNAi and wild-type cucumber, overexpression (OE) of CYP82D47 enhanced PM and Foc resistance in cucumber. Furthermore, the expression levels of SA-related genes (PR1, PR2, PR4, and PR5) increased in CYP82D47-overexpressing plants 7 days post fungal inoculation. The levels of ETH-related genes (EIN3 and EBF2) were similarly upregulated. The observed enhanced resistance was associated with the upregulation of SA/ETH-signaling-dependent defense genes. These findings indicate the crucial role of CYP82D47 in pathogen defense in cucumber. CYP82D47-overexpressing cucumber plants exhibited heightened susceptibility to both diseases. The study results offer important insights that could aid in the development of disease-resistant cucumber cultivars and elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the functions of CYP82D47.

Title: Differential DNA methylation and CTCF binding between the ESR1 promoter a of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
Abstract: ESR1 is expressed by 60-70% of breast tumours. it's a good prognosis factor and the target of hormone therapy. Optimization of ESR1 reactivation therapy is currently ongoing. Here we probe if the transcription factor CTCF plays a role in the differential expression of ESR1 in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ESR1+) and MDA-MB-231 (ESR1-). Knockdown of CTCF in MCF-7 resulted in decreased ESR1 gene expression. CTCF binds to the promoter of ESR1 in MCF-7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. CTCF ESR1 binding sites are unmethylated in MCF7 but methylated in MDA-MB-231 cells. ESR1 expression in MCF7 cells is dependent on CTCF expression. CTCF can bind to specific regions of the promotor of ESR1 gene in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells, this correlates with the methylation status of these regions and could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of ESR1.

Title: Glial cell alterations in diabetes-induced neurodegeneration.
Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a global epidemic that due to its increasing prevalence worldwide will likely become the most common debilitating health condition. Even if diabetes is primarily a metabolic disorder, it is now well established that key aspects of the pathogenesis of diabetes are associated with nervous system alterations, including deleterious chronic inflammation of neural tissues, referred here as neuroinflammation, along with different detrimental glial cell responses to stress conditions and neurodegenerative features. Moreover, diabetes resembles accelerated aging, further increasing the risk of developing age-linked neurodegenerative disorders. As such, the most common and disabling diabetic comorbidities, namely diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive decline, are intimately associated with neurodegeneration. As described in aging and other neurological disorders, glial cell alterations such as microglial, astrocyte, and Müller cell increased reactivity and dysfunctionality, myelin loss and Schwann cell alterations have been broadly described in diabetes in both human and animal models, where they are key contributors to chronic noxious inflammation of neural tissues within the PNS and CNS. In this review, we aim to describe in-depth the common and unique aspects underlying glial cell changes observed across the three main diabetic complications, with the goal of uncovering shared glial cells alterations and common pathological mechanisms that will enable the discovery of potential targets to limit neuroinflammation and prevent neurodegeneration in all three diabetic complications. Diabetes and its complications are already a public health concern due to its rapidly increasing incidence, and thus its health and economic impact. Hence, understanding the key role that glial cells play in the pathogenesis underlying peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, and cognitive decline in diabetes will provide us with novel therapeutic approaches to tackle diabetic-associated neurodegeneration.

Title: Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: report of the NINCDS-ADRDA Work Group under the auspices of Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease.
Abstract: Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease include insidious onset and progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. There are no motor, sensory, or coordination deficits early in the disease. The diagnosis cannot be determined by laboratory tests. These tests are important primarily in identifying other possible causes of dementia that must be excluded before the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease may be made with confidence. Neuropsychological tests provide confirmatory evidence of the diagnosis of dementia and help to assess the course and response to therapy. The criteria proposed are intended to serve as a guide for the diagnosis of probable, possible, and definite Alzheimer's disease; these criteria will be revised as more definitive information become available.

Title: eHealth in the Management of Depressive Episodes in Catalonia's Primary Care From 2017 to 2022: Retrospective Observational Study.
Abstract: The reasons for mental health consultations are becoming increasingly relevant in primary care. The Catalan health care system is undergoing a process of digital transformation, where eHealth is becoming increasingly relevant in routine clinical practice. This study aimed to analyze the approach to depressive episodes and the role of eHealth in the Catalan health care system from 2017 to 2022. A retrospective observational study was conducted on diagnostic codes related to depressive episodes and mood disorders between 2017 and 2022 using data from the Catalan Institute of Health. The sociodemographic evolution and prevalence of depression and mood disorders in Catalonia were analyzed between 2017 and 2022. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed using absolute frequency and percentage. The prevalence of depressive episodes was calculated, highlighting the year-to-year changes. The use of eHealth for related consultations was assessed by comparing the percentages of eHealth and face-to-face consultations. A comparison of sociodemographic variables based on attendance type was conducted. Additionally, a logistic regression model was used to explore factors influencing face-to-face attendance. The analysis used R software (version 4.2.1), with all differences examined using 95% CIs. From 2017 to 2022, there was an 86.6% increase in the prevalence of depression and mood disorders, with women consistently more affected (20,950/31,197, 67.2% in 2017 and 22,078/33,169, 66.6% in 2022). In 2022, a significant rise in depression diagnoses was observed in rural areas (difference 0.71%, 95% CI 0.04%-1.43%), contrasting with a significant decrease in urban settings (difference -0.7%, 95% CI -1.35% to -0.05%). There was a significant increase in antidepressant use in 2022 compared to 2017 (difference 2.4%, 95% CI 1.87%-3.06%) and the proportion of eHealth visits rose from 4.34% (1240/28,561) in 2017 to 26.3% (8501/32,267) in 2022. Logistic regression analysis indicated that men (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.09) and younger individuals had a higher likelihood of eHealth consultations in 2022. Furthermore, individuals using eHealth consultations were more likely to use antidepressants (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.50-1.57) and anxiolytics (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09). The prevalence of depression in Catalonia has significantly increased in the last 6 years, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite ongoing digital transformation since 2011, eHealth usage remained limited as of 2017. During the lockdown period, eHealth accounted for nearly half of all health care consultations, representing a quarter of consultations by 2022. In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging evidence suggests a significant role of eHealth in managing depression-related consultations, along with an apparent likelihood of patients being prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics. Further research is needed to understand the long-term impact of eHealth on diagnostic practices and medication use.

Title: Global cancer statistics, 2012.
Abstract: Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.

Title: Sotorasib Is a Pan-RASG12C Inhibitor Capable of Driving Clinical Response in NRASG12C Cancers.
Abstract: KRASG12C inhibitors, like sotorasib and adagrasib, potently and selectively inhibit KRASG12C through a covalent interaction with the mutant cysteine, driving clinical efficacy in KRASG12C tumors. Because amino acid sequences of the three main RAS isoforms-KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS-are highly similar, we hypothesized that some KRASG12C inhibitors might also target NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C, which are less common but critical oncogenic driver mutations in some tumors. Although some inhibitors, like adagrasib, were highly selective for KRASG12C, others also potently inhibited NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C. Notably, sotorasib was five-fold more potent against NRASG12C compared with KRASG12C or HRASG12C. Structural and reciprocal mutagenesis studies suggested that differences in isoform-specific binding are mediated by a single amino acid: Histidine-95 in KRAS (Leucine-95 in NRAS). A patient with NRASG12C colorectal cancer treated with sotorasib and the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab achieved a marked tumor response, demonstrating that sotorasib can be clinically effective in NRASG12C-mutated tumors. These studies demonstrate that certain KRASG12C inhibitors effectively target all RASG12C mutations and that sotorasib specifically is a potent NRASG12C inhibitor capable of driving clinical responses. These findings have important implications for the treatment of patients with NRASG12C or HRASG12C cancers and could guide design of NRAS or HRAS inhibitors.

Title: Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.
Abstract: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

Title: Neurostimulation for Advanced Parkinson Disease and Quality of Life at 5 Years: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) improves quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). However, controlled studies with more than 3 years of follow-up are lacking. To investigate the long-term effects of STN-DBS on QOL compared with standard-of-care medication (MED). In this prospective, observational, quasi-experimental, longitudinal nonrandomized controlled trial, 183 patients were screened for eligibility and 167 were enrolled from March 1, 2011, to May 31, 2017, at 3 European university centers. Propensity score matching for demographic and clinical characteristics was applied to 108 patients with PD (62 in the STN-DBS group and 46 in the MED group), resulting in a well-balanced, matched subcohort of 25 patients per group. Data analysis was performed from September 2022 to January 2023. Treatment for PD of STN-DBS or MED. Assessments included Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 8 (PDQ-8), Unified PD Rating Scale-motor examination, Scales for Outcomes in PD-activities of daily living (ADL) and motor complications, and levodopa-equivalent daily dose. Within-group longitudinal outcome changes, between-group differences, and correlations of change scores were analyzed. The study population in the analysis included 108 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.7 [8.3] years; 66 [61.1%] male). At 5-year follow-up, PDQ-8 and ADL worsened only in the MED group (PDQ-8 change, -10.9; 95% CI, -19.0 to -2.7; P = .01; ADL change: -2.0; 95% CI, -3.1 to -0.8; P = .002), whereas both outcomes remained stable in the STN-DBS group (PDQ-8 change, -4.3; 95% CI, -13.2 to 4.7; P = .34; ADL change, -0.8; 95% CI, -2.5 to 1.0; P = .38). Changes in PDQ-8 and ADL correlated moderately (rs = .40, P = .008). Furthermore, STN-DBS outcomes were favorable for motor complications (median difference in change scores between STN-DBS and MED, -2.0; 95% CI, -4.0 to -1.0; P = .003), mobility (-1.0; 95% CI, -2.0 to 0; P = .03), and levodopa-equivalent daily dose reduction (-821.4; 95% CI, -1111.9 to -530.8; P < .001). This study provides evidence of differences in QOL outcomes at 5-year follow-up between STN-DBS (stable) and MED (worsened), mainly driven by the favorable effect of STN-DBS on mobility (class IIb evidence). The association between changes in QOL and ADL, but not motor impairment or complications, highlights the relative importance of ADL outcomes for long-term DBS assessments.

Title: The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Abstract: Long-term microvascular and neurologic complications cause major morbidity and mortality in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We examined whether intensive treatment with the goal of maintaining blood glucose concentrations close to the normal range could decrease the frequency and severity of these complications. A total of 1441 patients with IDDM--726 with no retinopathy at base line (the primary-prevention cohort) and 715 with mild retinopathy (the secondary-intervention cohort) were randomly assigned to intensive therapy administered either with an external insulin pump or by three or more daily insulin injections and guided by frequent blood glucose monitoring or to conventional therapy with one or two daily insulin injections. The patients were followed for a mean of 6.5 years, and the appearance and progression of retinopathy and other complications were assessed regularly. In the primary-prevention cohort, intensive therapy reduced the adjusted mean risk for the development of retinopathy by 76 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 62 to 85 percent), as compared with conventional therapy. In the secondary-intervention cohort, intensive therapy slowed the progression of retinopathy by 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 66 percent) and reduced the development of proliferative or severe nonproliferative retinopathy by 47 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 67 percent). In the two cohorts combined, intensive therapy reduced the occurrence of microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion of > or = 40 mg per 24 hours) by 39 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 52 percent), that of albuminuria (urinary albumin excretion of > or = 300 mg per 24 hours) by 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval 19 to 74 percent), and that of clinical neuropathy by 60 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 38 to 74 percent). The chief adverse event associated with intensive therapy was a two-to-threefold increase in severe hypoglycemia. Intensive therapy effectively delays the onset and slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in patients with IDDM.

Title: Cannabis and Driving in Older Adults.
Abstract: Epidemiological studies have found that cannabis increases the risk of a motor vehicle collision. Cannabis use is increasing in older adults, but laboratory studies of the association between cannabis and driving in people aged older than 65 years are lacking. To investigate the association between cannabis, simulated driving, and concurrent blood tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels in older adults. Using an ecologically valid counterbalanced design, in this cohort study, regular cannabis users operated a driving simulator before, 30 minutes after, and 180 minutes after smoking their preferred legal cannabis or after resting. This study was conducted in Toronto, Canada, between March and November 2022 with no follow-up period. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to February 2023. Most participants chose THC-dominant cannabis with a mean (SD) content of 18.74% (6.12%) THC and 1.46% (3.37%) cannabidiol (CBD). The primary end point was SD of lateral position (SDLP, or weaving). Secondary outcomes were mean speed (MS), maximum speed, SD of speed, and reaction time. Driving was assessed under both single-task and dual-task (distracted) conditions. Blood THC and metabolites of THC and CBD were also measured at the time of the drives. A total of 31 participants (21 male [68%]; 29 White [94%], 1 Latin American [3%], and 1 mixed race [3%]; mean [SD] age, 68.7 [3.5] years), completed all study procedures. SDLP was increased and MS was decreased at 30 but not 180 minutes after smoking cannabis compared with the control condition in both the single-task (SDLP effect size [ES], 0.30; b = 1.65; 95% CI, 0.37 to 2.93; MS ES, -0.58; b = -2.46; 95% CI, -3.56 to -1.36) and dual-task (SDLP ES, 0.27; b = 1.75; 95% CI, 0.21 to 3.28; MS ES, -0.47; b = -3.15; 95% CI, -5.05 to -1.24) conditions. Blood THC levels were significantly increased at 30 minutes but not 180 minutes. Blood THC was not correlated with SDLP or MS at 30 minutes, and SDLP was not correlated with MS. Subjective ratings remained elevated for 5 hours and participants reported that they were less willing to drive at 3 hours after smoking. In this cohort study, the findings suggested that older drivers should exercise caution after smoking cannabis.

Title: The American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis.
Abstract: The revised criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were formulated from a computerized analysis of 262 contemporary, consecutively studied patients with RA and 262 control subjects with rheumatic diseases other than RA (non-RA). The new criteria are as follows: 1) morning stiffness in and around joints lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement; 2) soft tissue swelling (arthritis) of 3 or more joint areas observed by a physician; 3) swelling (arthritis) of the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, or wrist joints; 4) symmetric swelling (arthritis); 5) rheumatoid nodules; 6) the presence of rheumatoid factor; and 7) radiographic erosions and/or periarticular osteopenia in hand and/or wrist joints. Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6 weeks. Rheumatoid arthritis is defined by the presence of 4 or more criteria, and no further qualifications (classic, definite, or probable) or list of exclusions are required. In addition, a ""classification tree"" schema is presented which performs equally as well as the traditional (4 of 7) format. The new criteria demonstrated 91-94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for RA when compared with non-RA rheumatic disease control subjects.

Title: Immune-Related Adverse Events and Survival Among Patients With Metastatic NSCLC Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.
Abstract: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy reportedly improve overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, studies have been small and the association between irAE severity and OS remains poorly defined. To examine the association between irAEs and their severity with OS in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC receiving ICIs. This retrospective observational cohort study included patients with NSCLC receiving ICIs between March 1, 2014, and November 30, 2021, with follow-up until March 31, 2023. Data analysis was completed April 26, 2023. The Alberta Immunotherapy Database, a provincial, multicenter cohort, was used to capture data from patients receiving ICIs in Alberta, Canada. Participants included 803 patients 18 years or older who received at least 1 cycle of ICI (alone or with chemotherapy), agnostic to treatment line. Developing an irAE mandating delay or discontinuation of ICI therapy and/or systematic corticosteroids for management of toxic effects (hereinafter referred to as clinically meaningful irAEs). The primary outcome was association between irAEs and OS according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. Clinically meaningful irAEs were identified. Patients with poor prognosis (survival <3 months) who may have died prior to irAE development were excluded from OS analysis, mitigating immortal time bias. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses ascertained variables associated with OS. Among the 803 patients included in the analysis, the median age of patients with irAEs was 69.7 (IQR, 63.1-75.2) years and the median age of those without irAEs was 67.5 (IQR, 60.4-73.3) years, with comparable sex distribution (139 of 295 men [47.1%] and 156 of 295 women [52.9%] with irAEs vs 254 of 505 men [50.3%] and 251 of 505 women [49.7%] without irAEs). Mitigating immortal time bias (n = 611), irAEs were associated with OS (median OS with irAEs, 23.7 [95% CI, 19.3-29.1] months; median OS without irAEs, 9.8 [95% CI, 8.7-11.4] months; P < .001). No OS difference was associated with treatment in hospital vs as outpatients for an irAE (median OS, 20.8 [95% CI, 11.7-30.6] vs 25.6 [95% CI, 20.1-29.8] months; P = .33). Developing irAEs remained associated with OS in the total cohort after Cox proportional hazards regression with known prognostic characteristics (hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.40-0.70]; P < .001). In this cohort study of 803 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC receiving ICIs, developing a clinically meaningful irAE was associated with improved OS. This association was not compromised by hospitalization for severe toxic effects. Whether and how ICI therapy resumption after an irAE is associated with OS warrants further study.

Title: New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1).
Abstract: Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: both tumour shrinkage (objective response) and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials. Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse (>6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews. HIGHLIGHTS OF REVISED RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions to be assessed: based on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of five total (and from five to two per organ, maximum). Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes with a short axis of 15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10mm short axis are considered normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum, a 5mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression' of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions. A key question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or MRI. It was concluded that, at present, there is not sufficient standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of tumour burden. The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression. As is detailed in the final paper in this special issue, the use of these promising newer approaches requires appropriate clinical validation studies.

Title: Intra-Anterior Chamber Injection of Ranibizumab in Advanced Pediatric Vitreoretinal Diseases.
Abstract: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment through intravitreal or subretinal administrations has been proven effective for VEGF-driven pediatric vitreoretinal diseases but are not feasible for advanced cases, such as shallow traction retinal detachments or peripheral circumferential retinal detachments which adhere to the lens. Intra-anterior chamber injection (IAcI) of anti-VEGF may be a viable alternative in such cases but needs evaluation. To investigate the effects and safety of IAcI of anti-VEGF to treat VEGF-driven pediatric vitreoretinal diseases. This was a retrospective observational case series study conducted at Xinhua Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China. The study included 14 eyes of 13 children diagnosed with vitreoretinal disease exhibiting elevated vascular activity between January and August 2023. IAcI with ranibizumab. Retinal vascular abnormalities, vitreous hemorrhage resolution, and complications 1 month and 3 months after injection. Of 13 patients included in this study, 12 were male. The mean age was 4.6 years (range, 1 month to 9 years). Six patients were diagnosed with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, 4 with morning glory syndrome, 1 with retinopathy of prematurity, and 2 with chronic retinal detachments of unknown causes. At 1-month postoperative follow-up, vascular activity had decreased in 14 of 14 eyes. At 3-month follow-up, vascular activity had resolved in 7 of 14 eyes, persisted in 6 of 14 eyes, and reactivated in 1 of 14 eyes. On final observation, no complications were reported. These findings support the possibility of treatment using IAcI with ranibizumab to decrease retinal vascular abnormalities in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy or retinopathy of prematurity or related conditions, but further studies are needed to understand more precise benefits and risks. This approach might be considered in cases where intravitreal or subretinal injection are not feasible, recognizing the limitations of these findings and that longer-term outcomes still need to be monitored.

Title: Global cancer statistics, 2002.
Abstract: Estimates of the worldwide incidence, mortality and prevalence of 26 cancers in the year 2002 are now available in the GLOBOCAN series of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The results are presented here in summary form, including the geographic variation between 20 large ""areas"" of the world. Overall, there were 10.9 million new cases, 6.7 million deaths, and 24.6 million persons alive with cancer (within three years of diagnosis). The most commonly diagnosed cancers are lung (1.35 million), breast (1.15 million), and colorectal (1 million); the most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.18 million deaths), stomach cancer (700,000 deaths), and liver cancer (598,000 deaths). The most prevalent cancer in the world is breast cancer (4.4 million survivors up to 5 years following diagnosis). There are striking variations in the risk of different cancers by geographic area. Most of the international variation is due to exposure to known or suspected risk factors related to lifestyle or environment, and provides a clear challenge to prevention.

Title: Endocrine-Sensitive Disease Rate in Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Rich/ERBB2-Negative Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, or Their Combination: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.
Abstract: Adding fulvestrant to anastrozole (A+F) improved survival in postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer. However, the combination has not been tested in early-stage disease. To determine whether neoadjuvant fulvestrant or A+F increases the rate of pathologic complete response or ypT1-2N0/N1mic/Ki67 2.7% or less residual disease (referred to as endocrine-sensitive disease) over anastrozole alone. A phase 3 randomized clinical trial assessing differences in clinical and correlative outcomes between each of the fulvestrant-containing arms and the anastrozole arm. Postmenopausal women with clinical stage II to III, ER-rich (Allred score 6-8 or >66%)/ERBB2-negative breast cancer were included. All analyses were based on data frozen on March 2, 2023. Patients received anastrozole, fulvestrant, or a combination for 6 months preoperatively. Tumor Ki67 was assessed at week 4 and optionally at week 12, and if greater than 10% at either time point, the patient switched to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immediate surgery. The primary outcome was the endocrine-sensitive disease rate (ESDR). A secondary outcome was the percentage change in Ki67 after 4 weeks of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) (week 4 Ki67 suppression). Between February 2014 and November 2018, 1362 female patients (mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.2] years) were enrolled. Among the 1298 evaluable patients, ESDRs were 18.7% (95% CI, 15.1%-22.7%), 22.8% (95% CI, 18.9%-27.1%), and 20.5% (95% CI, 16.8%-24.6%) with anastrozole, fulvestrant, and A+F, respectively. Compared to anastrozole, neither fulvestrant-containing regimen significantly improved ESDR or week 4 Ki67 suppression. The rate of week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10% was 25.1%, 24.2%, and 15.7% with anastrozole, fulvestrant, and A+F, respectively. Pathologic complete response/residual cancer burden class I occurred in 8 of 167 patients and 17 of 167 patients, respectively (15.0%; 95% CI, 9.9%-21.3%), after switching to neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10%. PAM50 subtyping derived from RNA sequencing of baseline biopsies available for 753 patients (58%) identified 394 luminal A, 304 luminal B, and 55 nonluminal tumors. A+F led to a greater week 4 Ki67 suppression than anastrozole alone in luminal B tumors (median [IQR], -90.4% [-95.2 to -81.9%] vs -76.7% [-89.0 to -55.6%]; P < .001), but not luminal A tumors. Thirty-six nonluminal tumors (65.5%) had a week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10%. In this randomized clinical trial, neither fulvestrant nor A+F significantly improved the 6-month ESDR over anastrozole in ER-rich/ERBB2-negative breast cancer. Aromatase inhibition remains the standard-of-care NET. Differential NET response by PAM50 subtype in exploratory analyses warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01953588.

Title: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: the JNC 7 report.
Abstract: ""The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure"" provides a new guideline for hypertension prevention and management. The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.

Title: Computational Workflow for Refining AlphaFold Models in Drug Design Using Kinetic and Thermodynamic Binding Calculations: A Case Study for the Unresolved Inactive Human Adenosine A<sub>3</sub> Receptor.
Abstract: A structure-based drug design pipeline that considers both thermodynamic and kinetic binding data of ligands against a receptor will enable the computational design of improved drug molecules. For unresolved GPCR-ligand complexes, a workflow that can apply both thermodynamic and kinetic binding data in combination with alpha-fold (AF)-derived or other homology models and experimentally resolved binding modes of relevant ligands in GPCR-homologs needs to be tested. Here, as test case, we studied a congeneric set of ligands that bind to a structurally unresolved G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the inactive human adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor (hA<sub>3</sub>R). We tested three available homology models from which two have been generated from experimental structures of hA<sub>1</sub>R or hA<sub>2</sub>AR and one model was a multistate alphafold 2 (AF2)-derived model. We applied alchemical calculations with thermodynamic integration coupled with molecular dynamics (TI/MD) simulations to calculate the experimental relative binding free energies and residence time (τ)-random accelerated MD (τ-RAMD) simulations to calculate the relative residence times (RTs) for antagonists. While the TI/MD calculations produced, for the three homology models, good Pearson correlation coefficients, correspondingly, <i>r</i> = 0.74, 0.62, and 0.67 and mean unsigned error (mue) values of 0.94, 1.31, and 0.81 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, the τ-RAMD method showed <i>r</i> = 0.92 and 0.52 for the first two models but failed to produce accurate results for the multistate AF2-derived model. With subsequent optimization of the AF2-derived model by reorientation of the side chain of R173<sup>5.34</sup> located in the extracellular loop 2 (EL2) that blocked ligand's unbinding, the computational model showed <i>r</i> = 0.84 for kinetic data and improved performance for thermodynamic data (<i>r</i> = 0.81, mue = 0.56 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). Overall, after refining the multistate AF2 model with physics-based tools, we were able to show a strong correlation between predicted and experimental ligand relative residence times and affinities, achieving a level of accuracy comparable to an experimental structure. The computational workflow used can be applied to other receptors, helping to rank candidate drugs in a congeneric series and enabling the prioritization of leads with stronger binding affinities and longer residence times.

Title: Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin compared with conventional treatment and risk of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 33). UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group.
Abstract: Improved blood-glucose control decreases the progression of diabetic microvascular disease, but the effect on macrovascular complications is unknown. There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial. 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48-60 years), who after 3 months' diet treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6.1-15.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol/L. In the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone; drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than 15 mmol/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also analysed by actual therapy. Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.0% (6.2-8.2) in the intensive group compared with 7.9% (6.9-8.8) in the conventional group--an 11% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in the intensive group was 12% lower (95% CI 1-21, p=0.029) for any diabetes-related endpoint; 10% lower (-11 to 27, p=0.34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6% lower (-10 to 20, p=0.44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25% risk reduction (7-40, p=0.0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p<0.0001). The rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0.7% with conventional treatment, 1.0% with chlorpropamide, 1.4% with glibenclamide, and 1.8% with insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2.9 kg) than in the conventional group (p<0.001), and patients assigned insulin had a greater gain in weight (4.0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2.6 kg) or glibenclamide (1.7 kg). Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Title: The Impact of Circulating Tumor Cell HOXB13 RNA Detection in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Treated with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.
Abstract: HOXB13 is an androgen receptor (AR) coregulator specifically expressed in cells of prostatic lineage. We sought to associate circulating tumor cell (CTC) HOXB13 expression with outcomes in men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the multicenter prospective PROPHECY trial of mCRPC men (NCT02269982, n = 118) treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. CTC detection and HOXB13 complementary DNA (cDNA) expression was measured using a modified Adnatest, grouping patients into 3 categories: CTC 0 (undetectable); CTC+ HOXB13 CTC low (<4 copies); or CTC+ HOXB13 CTC high. The HOXB13 threshold was determined by maximally selected rank statistics for prognostic associations with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We included 102 men with sufficient CTC HOXB13 cDNA, identifying 25%, 31%, and 44% of patients who were CTC 0, CTC+ HOXB13 low, and CTC+ HOXB13 high, respectively. Median OS were 25.7, 27.8, and 12.1 months whereas the median PFS were 9.0, 7.7, and 3.8 months, respectively. In subgroup analysis among men with CellSearch CTCs ≥5 copies/mL and adjusting for prior abi/enza treatment and Halabi clinical risk score, the multivariate HR for HOXB13 CTC detection was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.06-5.40) for OS and 2.78 (95% CI, 1.38-5.59) for PFS, respectively. Low HOXB13 CTC detection was associated with lower CTC PSA, PSMA, AR-FL, and AR-V7 detection, and more liver/lung metastases (41% vs. 25%). Higher CTC HOXB13 expression is associated with AR-dependent biomarkers in CTCs and is adversely prognostic in the context of potent AR inhibition in men with mCRPC.

Title: Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China.
Abstract: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients. We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.).

Title: Phase II Study of Eribulin plus Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Soft-tissue Sarcomas: Clinical Outcomes and Biological Correlates.
Abstract: Eribulin modulates the tumor-immune microenvironment via cGAS-STING signaling in preclinical models. This non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the combination of eribulin and pembrolizumab in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). Patients enrolled in one of three cohorts: leiomyosarcoma (LMS), liposarcomas (LPS), or other STS that may benefit from PD-1 inhibitors, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). Eribulin was administered at 1.4 mg/m2 i.v. (days 1 and 8) with fixed-dose pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. (day 1) of each 21-day cycle, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 2 years of treatment. The primary endpoint was the 12-week progression-free survival rate (PFS-12) in each cohort. Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, median PFS, safety profile, and overall survival (OS). Pretreatment and on-treatment blood specimens were evaluated in patients who achieved durable disease control (DDC) or progression within 12 weeks [early progression (EP)]. Multiplexed immunofluorescence was performed on archival LPS samples from patients with DDC or EP. Fifty-seven patients enrolled (LMS, n = 19; LPS, n = 20; UPS/Other, n = 18). The PFS-12 was 36.8% (90% confidence interval: 22.5-60.4) for LMS, 69.6% (54.5-89.0) for LPS, and 52.6% (36.8-75.3) for UPS/Other cohorts. All 3 patients in the UPS/Other cohort with angiosarcoma achieved RECIST responses. Toxicity was manageable. Higher IFNα and IL4 serum levels were associated with clinical benefit. Immune aggregates expressing PD-1 and PD-L1 were observed in a patient that completed 2 years of treatment. The combination of eribulin and pembrolizumab demonstrated promising activity in LPS and angiosarcoma.

Title: Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects in 7 percent of patients. The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity.

Title: Phase II DORA Study of Olaparib with or without Durvalumab as a Chemotherapy-Free Maintenance Strategy in Platinum-Pretreated Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of PARP inhibition with or without programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade as chemotherapy-free maintenance therapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (aTNBC) sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the phase II non-comparative DORA trial (NCT03167619), patients with ongoing stable disease (SD) or complete/partial response (CR/PR) to first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy for TNBC (≤10% estrogen/progesterone receptor expression) were randomized 1:1 to receive olaparib 300 mg twice daily with or without durvalumab 1,500 mg on day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) versus a historical control of continued platinum-based therapy. 45 patients were randomized (23 to olaparib alone, 22 to the combination; 3 with estrogen/progesterone receptor expression 1%-10%). At 9.8 months' median follow-up, median PFS from randomization was 4.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-6.1] months with olaparib and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.7-10.1) months with the combination, both significantly longer than the historical control (P = 0.0023 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Clinical benefit rates (SD ≥24 weeks or CR/PR) were 44% (95% CI, 23%-66%) and 36% (95% CI, 17%-59%) in the monotherapy and combination arms, respectively. Sustained clinical benefit was seen irrespective of germline BRCA mutation or PD-L1 status, but tended to be associated with CR/PR to prior platinum, particularly in the olaparib-alone arm. No new safety signals were reported. PFS was longer than expected with both regimens. A patient subset with wild-type BRCA platinum-sensitive aTNBC had durable disease control with chemotherapy-free maintenance.

Title: Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.
Abstract: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

Title: Pharmacokinetics, Disposition, and Biotransformation of [<sup>14</sup>C]Lenacapavir, a Novel, First-in-Class, Selective Inhibitor of HIV-1 Capsid Function, in Healthy Participants Following a Single Intravenous Infusion.
Abstract: Lenacapavir (LEN) is a novel, first-in-class, multistage, selective inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid function recently approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection. The purpose of this multicohort study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, excretion, safety, and tolerability of LEN following a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 10 mg LEN or 20 mg [<sup>14</sup>C]LEN in healthy participants. Twenty-one healthy adult participants were enrolled into the study and received either a single IV dose of 10 mg LEN (n = 8 active, n = 3 placebo; cohort 1) or a single IV dose of 20 mg [<sup>14</sup>C]LEN containing 200 µCi (n = 10; cohort 2). Blood, urine, and feces samples (when applicable) were collected after dosing, and radioactivity (cohort 2) was assessed using liquid scintillation counting in both plasma and excreta. LEN in plasma was quantified by liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) method bioanalysis. Metabolite profiling in plasma and excreta were performed using LC-fraction collect (FC)-high-resolution MS and LC-FC-accelerator mass spectrometry in plasma. Between the 10 mg and 20 mg doses of LEN, the observed plasma exposure of LEN doubled, while the elimination half-life was similar. Following administration of 20 mg [<sup>14</sup>C]LEN (200 µCi), the mean cumulative recovery of [<sup>14</sup>C] radioactivity was 75.9% and 0.24% from feces and urine, respectively. The mean whole [<sup>14</sup>C] blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 0.5-0.7, which showed a low distribution of LEN to red blood cells. Intact LEN was the predominant circulating species in plasma (representing 68.8% of circulating radioactivity), and no single metabolite contributed to > 10% of total radioactivity exposure through 1176 h postdose. Similarly, intact LEN was the most abundant component (32.9% of administered dose; 75.9% of recovered dose) measured in feces, with metabolites accounting for trace amounts. These results suggest metabolism of LEN is not a primary pathway of elimination. Of the metabolites observed in the feces, the three most abundant metabolites were direct phase 2 conjugates (glucuronide, hexose, and pentose conjugates), with additional metabolites formed to a lesser extent via other pathways. The administered LEN IV doses were generally safe and well-tolerated across participants in this study. The results of this mass balance study indicated that LEN was majorly eliminated as intact LEN via the feces. The renal pathway played a minor role in LEN elimination (0.24%). In addition, no major circulating metabolites in plasma or feces were found, indicating minimal metabolism of LEN.

Title: Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin.
Abstract: Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.

Title: The role of bidirectional communication between the adipokines and the endogenous opioid system in an experimental mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death globally. Multiple factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of CRC, including the abnormalities in the functioning of the endogenous opioid system (EOS) or adiponectin-related signaling. The aim of our study was to evaluate if differences in the expression of opioid receptors (ORs) influence the development of CRC and if modulation of adiponectin receptors using AdipoRon, a selective AdipoR1 receptor agonist, affects colorectal carcinogenesis. Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, was injected intraperitoneally every second day for 2 weeks, at the dose of 1 mg/kg in healthy Balb/C mice to induce changes in ORs expression. CRC was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) and the addition of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) into drinking water in three-week cycles. The development of CRC was assessed using macro- and microscopic scoring and molecular analysis (RT qPCR, ELISA) after 14 weeks. Naltrexone significantly increased the mRNA expression of Oprm1, Oprd1, and Oprk1 in the mouse colon and in the brain (non-significantly). The pretreatment of mice with naltrexone aggravated the course of CRC (as indicated by tumor area, colon thickness, and spleen weight). The level of circulatory adiponectin was lowered in mice with CRC and increased in the colon as compared with healthy mice. The β-endorphin level was increased in the plasma of mice with CRC and decreased in the colon as compared to healthy mice. AdipoRon, AdipoR1 agonist, worsened the CRC development, and pretreatment with naltrexone enhanced this negative effect in mice. CRC did not affect the expression of the Adipor1 gene, but the Adipor1 level was increased in mice pretreated with naltrexone (AOM/DSS and healthy mice). AdipoRon did not influence the expression of opioid receptors at the mRNA level in the colon of mice with CRC. The mRNA expression of Ptgs2, Il6, Nos2, Il1b, Il18, Gsdmd, and Rela was increased in mice with CRC as compared to the healthy colon. AdipoRon significantly decreased mRNA expression of Ptgs2, Il6, Il1b, and Il18 as compared to CRC mice. EOS and adiponectin-related signaling may play a role in the pathogenesis of CRC and these systems may present some additivity during carcinogenesis.

Title: Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics.
Abstract: The term apoptosis is proposed for a hitherto little recognized mechanism of controlled cell deletion, which appears to play a complementary but opposite role to mitosis in the regulation of animal cell populations. Its morphological features suggest that it is an active, inherently programmed phenomenon, and it has been shown that it can be initiated or inhibited by a variety of environmental stimuli, both physiological and pathological.The structural changes take place in two discrete stages. The first comprises nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation and breaking up of the cell into a number of membrane-bound, ultrastructurally well-preserved fragments. In the second stage these apoptotic bodies are shed from epithelial-lined surfaces or are taken up by other cells, where they undergo a series of changes resembling in vitro autolysis within phagosomes, and are rapidly degraded by lysosomal enzymes derived from the ingesting cells.Apoptosis seems to be involved in cell turnover in many healthy adult tissues and is responsible for focal elimination of cells during normal embryonic development. It occurs spontaneously in untreated malignant neoplasms, and participates in at least some types of therapeutically induced tumour regression. It is implicated in both physiological involution and atrophy of various tissues and organs. It can also be triggered by noxious agents, both in the embryo and adult animal.

Title: Treatment outcomes and risk factors of patients with intracranial germ cell tumour with choriocarcinoma element or β-HCG level higher than 500 IU/L.
Abstract: In previous studies, patients with intracranial germ cell tumour (iGCT) with pure choriocarcinoma or mixed germ cell tumours with choriocarcinoma element showed similar dismal prognoses, with median overall survival (OS) of 22 months and 1-year survival rate of approximately 60%. However, these conclusions need to be updated because radiotherapy, which is the mainstay for this disease, was not applied in a number of patients. Additionally, prognostic factors need to be explored in this population. Clinical data of patients with iGCTs with histologically confirmed choriocarcinoma element or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) > 500 IU/L were collected from the archives of our institution and retrospectively studied. A total of 76 patients were eligible for this study. Except for two early deaths, all patients received radiotherapy (craniospinal irradiation [CSI], n = 23; non-CSI, n = 51). The median follow-up duration for the entire series was 63 months (range, 6-188 months). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS rates were 81.5% and 84.1%, respectively. Among patients who did not have early death or progressive disease after induction chemotherapy, multivariate analysis revealed that chemotherapy cycles (> 4 vs. ≤ 4) (hazard ratio [HR] for EFS 0.144, p = 0.020; HR for OS 0.111, p = 0.028) and β-HCG levels (> 3000 IU/L vs. ≤ 3000 IU/L) (HR for EFS 4.342, p = 0.059; HR for OS 6.614, p = 0.033) were independent factors for survival. Patients with iGCTs with choriocarcinoma element or β-HCG > 500 IU/L showed improved survival with radiotherapy-based treatments. Additional chemotherapy cycles could result in additional survival benefits. Patients with β-HCG level > 3000 IU/L had poorer prognosis.

Title: Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: principal results From the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial.
Abstract: Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States. Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes. On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years. Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.

Title: Mouse Melanoma Model in Tumor Vaccines and Immunotherapy Research.
Abstract: Efficacy of novel cancer immunization protocols could be tested in cell line-derived xenograft tumor models (CDX), which are based on the implantation of human tumor cell lines into mice for the development of different tumors by numerous means, such as subcutaneous implantation and orthotopic, venial, or peritoneal injections. However, the disadvantages of this model are the biological alteration of the derived cells or the inability of the cell lines to accurately reflect the complexity of tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, syngeneic mouse models, which offer a relatively simple grafting technique, preservation of lineage hierarchy, and the ability to generate tumors in as little as 2-8 weeks, are being used to study potential future applications in medical treatment, particularly immunotherapies. Here, we describe a B16.F10 C57Bl/6 mouse melanoma model we selected for therapeutic studies employing IL-2 and IL-12 immunization protocols. Procedure of tumor cells inoculation and melanoma development in mice is described in detail, as first and necessary set-up for successful immunization experiments.

Title: Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS).
Abstract: One method of evaluating the degree of neurologic impairment in MS has been the combination of grades (0 = normal to 5 or 6 = maximal impairment) within 8 Functional Systems (FS) and an overall Disability Status Scale (DSS) that had steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). A new Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is presented, with each of the former steps (1,2,3 . . . 9) now divided into two (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 . . . 9.5). The lower portion is obligatorily defined by Functional System grades. The FS are Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Brain Stem, Sensory, Bowel & Bladder, Visual, Cerebral, and Other; the Sensory and Bowel & Bladder Systems have been revised. Patterns of FS and relations of FS by type and grade to the DSS are demonstrated.

Title: Preclinical Mouse Metastatic Model Established Through Induced Lung Metastases.
Abstract: Metastatic disease is the major cause of cancer death, and the lung is one of the most common sites of cancer metastases. To investigate systemic antitumor effects or protective potential of local therapies, mouse models with induced metastases are indispensable in preclinical cancer research. Here, we describe the protocol for the metastatic mouse model established through induced 4T1 mammary carcinoma metastases. With minor prior optimization, it can be applied to other tumor cell lines of interest.

Title: Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
Abstract: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Documented NCIP. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.

Title: Azoxymethane/Dextran Sodium Sulfate (AOM/DSS) Model of Colorectal Cancer.
Abstract: Recent progress in developing new vaccination strategies against cancer requires the production of complex and reliable animal models reflecting the complexity of the tumors with their microenvironment. Mice can be considered a good source due to low cost and ease of being genetically modified, inoculated with tumor cell lines or treated by chemicals to induce different cancers. Despite significant limitations in modeling human cancer complexity, preclinical trials conducted in mice can efficiently contribute to understand molecular mechanisms of cancer, to closely resemble and follow carcinogenesis steps impossible to study into humans, and to test new anticancer therapies. In this chapter, we generally describe the different mouse models developed for cancer vaccines' preclinical trials. A particular focus is dedicated to a chemically-induced colorectal cancer model in use in our laboratories.

Title: The obligatory role of endothelial cells in the relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by acetylcholine.
Abstract: Despite its very potent vasodilating action in vivo, acetylcholine (ACh) does not always produce relaxation of isolated preparations of blood vessels in vitro. For example, in the helical strip of the rabbit descending thoracic aorta, the only reported response to ACh has been graded contractions, occurring at concentrations above 0.1 muM and mediated by muscarinic receptors. Recently, we observed that in a ring preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, ACh produced marked relaxation at concentrations lower than those required to produce contraction (confirming an earlier report by Jelliffe). In investigating this apparent discrepancy, we discovered that the loss of relaxation of ACh in the case of the strip was the result of unintentional rubbing of its intimal surface against foreign surfaces during its preparation. If care was taken to avoid rubbing of the intimal surface during preparation, the tissue, whether ring, transverse strip or helical strip, always exhibited relaxation to ACh, and the possibility was considered that rubbing of the intimal surface had removed endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that relaxation of isolated preparations of rabbit thoracic aorta and other blood vessels by ACh requires the presence of endothelial cells, and that ACh, acting on muscarinic receptors of these cells, stimulates release of a substance(s) that causes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. We propose that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for ACh-induced vasodilation in vivo. Preliminary reports on some aspects of the work have been reported elsewhere.

Title: Urinary Bladder Cancer Induced by N-Butyl-N-(4-Hydroxybutyl)-Nitrosamine.
Abstract: Urinary bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide with high morbidity and mortality. The majority of bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas. More than half are papillomas or the papillary urothelial carcinomas (stages Ta and T1), which have a relatively good prognosis. Squamous cell carcinomas have a variable survival rate, while carcinomas in situ (Tis) can progress to muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas (T2) with a poor prognosis. The most challenging feature of bladder cancer is its high recurrence rate, ranging from 50% to 90% of cases. The N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) model is an invaluable experimental tool for bladder cancer research, as BBN-induced bladder cancer in rodents resembles human bladder cancer in its morphological, biological, and molecular features. We present here a detailed protocol for the treatment of mice and the main expected results.

Title: Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.
Abstract: Eighty-three brains obtained at autopsy from nondemented and demented individuals were examined for extracellular amyloid deposits and intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes. The distribution pattern and packing density of amyloid deposits turned out to be of limited significance for differentiation of neuropathological stages. Neurofibrillary changes occurred in the form of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. The distribution of neuritic plaques varied widely not only within architectonic units but also from one individual to another. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, in contrast, exhibited a characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation of six stages. The first two stages were characterized by an either mild or severe alteration of the transentorhinal layer Pre-alpha (transentorhinal stages I-II). The two forms of limbic stages (stages III-IV) were marked by a conspicuous affection of layer Pre-alpha in both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex. In addition, there was mild involvement of the first Ammon's horn sector. The hallmark of the two isocortical stages (stages V-VI) was the destruction of virtually all isocortical association areas. The investigation showed that recognition of the six stages required qualitative evaluation of only a few key preparations.

Title: Research on Rare Diseases in Germany - Using small fish and super-resolution microscopy to track down a rare disease.
Abstract: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a rare disease, or damage to the filtering units of the kidney, the glomeruli, about of which there is only limited knowledge and few treatment options. The STOP-FSGS consortium has set itself the goal to expand our knowledge of this disease and develop new treatment options. Through intensive research and the use of state-of-the-art techniques such as super-resolution microscopy, AI-based imaging and single-cell research, the consortium aims to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of FSGS. This will allow the disease to be diagnosed more accurately and thus enable targeted and more effective treatment of patients. Another focus is on the search for drugs that slow down or even cure the disease. By establishing a rapid animal model, i.e. zebrafish larva, potential substances/drugs were identified that can alleviate FSGS. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy was used to precisely quantify the structural changes in the kidney by determining the so-called 'filtration slit density' (FSD) and to identify a marker allowing a personalised prognosis and assessment of the course of the disease. The results obtained help to better recognise the progression of FSGS and to optimally adapt treatment in order to improve the quality of life of the afflicted individuals and avoid renal replacement therapies.

Title: Banting lecture 1988. Role of insulin resistance in human disease.
Abstract: Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is present in the majority of patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in approximately 25% of nonobese individuals with normal oral glucose tolerance. In these conditions, deterioration of glucose tolerance can only be prevented if the beta-cell is able to increase its insulin secretory response and maintain a state of chronic hyperinsulinemia. When this goal cannot be achieved, gross decompensation of glucose homeostasis occurs. The relationship between insulin resistance, plasma insulin level, and glucose intolerance is mediated to a significant degree by changes in ambient plasma free-fatty acid (FFA) concentration. Patients with NIDDM are also resistant to insulin suppression of plasma FFA concentration, but plasma FFA concentrations can be reduced by relatively small increments in insulin concentration. Consequently, elevations of circulating plasma FFA concentration can be prevented if large amounts of insulin can be secreted. If hyperinsulinemia cannot be maintained, plasma FFA concentration will not be suppressed normally, and the resulting increase in plasma FFA concentration will lead to increased hepatic glucose production. Because these events take place in individuals who are quite resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, it is apparent that even small increases in hepatic glucose production are likely to lead to significant fasting hyperglycemia under these conditions. Although hyperinsulinemia may prevent frank decompensation of glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant individuals, this compensatory response of the endocrine pancreas is not without its price. Patients with hypertension, treated or untreated, are insulin resistant, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic. In addition, a direct relationship between plasma insulin concentration and blood pressure has been noted. Hypertension can also be produced in normal rats when they are fed a fructose-enriched diet, an intervention that also leads to the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. The development of hypertension in normal rats by an experimental manipulation known to induce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia provides further support for the view that the relationship between the three variables may be a causal one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Title: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Abrocitinib Compared with Other Systemic Treatments for Severe Atopic Dermatitis in Spain.
Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by itchy, painful, and dry skin. Despite the great number of available therapies, economic evaluations are still needed to provide evidence on their cost efficiency. This research aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor abrocitinib (200 mg) compared with dupilumab (300 mg), tralokinumab (300 mg), baricitinib (2 and 4 mg), and upadacitinib (15 and 30 mg) for the treatment of patients with severe AD from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective. A hybrid model consisting of a decision tree linked to a Markov model was developed to estimate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total years in response and incremental cost-per-QALY gained (willingness-to-pay [WTP] threshold: €25,000/QALY). Adults with severe AD entered the decision tree and response (75% reduction in baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index score, EASI-75) was considered at 16 and 52 weeks. After this time, patients entered the Markov model (remainder of the 10-year time horizon), which consisted of three health states: maintenance with active therapy, subsequent treatment, or death. All costs were presented in 2022 euros (€). Additionally, cost per number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was calculated for abrocitinib and dupilumab based on a head-to-head post-hoc analysis. Abrocitinib 200 mg was dominant (i.e., lower incremental costs and higher incremental benefit) compared with all studied alternatives (dupilumab 300 mg, tralokinumab 300 mg, baricitinib 2 and 4 mg, upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg) with a QALYs gain of 0.49, 0.60, 0.64, 0.43, 0.45, and 0.08, respectively, and per-person costs savings of €22,097, €24,140, €14,825, €7,116, €12,805, and €45,189, respectively. Considering the WTP threshold, abrocitinib was dominant or cost effective compared with all alternatives for most simulations. Additionally, abrocitinib was dominant compared with all alternatives when evaluating the cost effectiveness over a 5-year time horizon. NNT showed that abrocitinib was dominant versus dupilumab. The results of the study show that abrocitinib is a cost-effective therapy compared with other JAK inhibitors and biological therapies from the Spanish NHS perspective.

Title: Improved survival with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma.
Abstract: An improvement in overall survival among patients with metastatic melanoma has been an elusive goal. In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. A total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events. Ipilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094653.)

Title: Evaluating Monitoring Guidelines of Clozapine-Induced Adverse Effects: a Systematic Review.
Abstract: Despite the evidence that no other antipsychotic is effective as clozapine for the treatment of resistant schizophrenia, it is associated with various metabolic, neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Guidelines aiming to address the monitoring of clozapine's (serious) adverse effects can be helpful to prevent and treat these effects. However, many of these guidelines seem to lack one or more important monitoring recommendations. We aimed to systematically review the content and quality of existing monitoring guidelines/recommendations for clozapine-induced adverse effects. A comprehensive and systematic literature search, using the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases, was conducted for guidelines/recommendations on the monitoring of clozapine-induced adverse events, published between January 2004 and April 2023 (last search 16 April 2023). Only peer-reviewed published guidelines reporting on the comprehensive monitoring of all major clozapine-induced adverse effects and including evidence-based recommendations, developed after the year 2004, were included. Studies reporting on the monitoring of adverse effects of clozapine without being a formal guideline, guidelines reporting on the monitoring of one or a limited number of adverse effects of clozapine, guidelines that were not peer reviewed or published, expert opinion papers without formal consensus guideline development, or guidelines developed before the year 2004, were excluded. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) tool was used to evaluate the guidelines/recommendations' quality. Only one guideline met the inclusion criteria. This consensus statement made recommendations for hematological monitoring, and the monitoring of metabolic, cardiac, and three other adverse effects. Highest scores for the qualitative assessment were found for the domains ""scope and purpose"" (66.7%), ""clarity of presentation"" (44.4%), and ""editorial independence"" (66.7%). Lowest scores were found for ""rigor of development"" (14.6%) and ""applicability"" (0%). Future guidelines should develop more comprehensive recommendations about specific clozapine-induced adverse effects, including constipation, myocarditis, tachycardia, and seizures, as well as include a rechallenge policy. There is an urgent need for well-developed, methodologically stringent, guidelines. PROSPERO registration number, CRD42023402480.

Title: A new method for measuring daytime sleepiness: the Epworth sleepiness scale.
Abstract: The development and use of a new scale, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), is described. This is a simple, self-administered questionnaire which is shown to provide a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. One hundred and eighty adults answered the ESS, including 30 normal men and women as controls and 150 patients with a range of sleep disorders. They rated the chances that they would doze off or fall asleep when in eight different situations commonly encountered in daily life. Total ESS scores significantly distinguished normal subjects from patients in various diagnostic groups including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. ESS scores were significantly correlated with sleep latency measured during the multiple sleep latency test and during overnight polysomnography. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ESS scores were significantly correlated with the respiratory disturbance index and the minimum SaO2 recorded overnight. ESS scores of patients who simply snored did not differ from controls.

Title: Could a Long-Acting Prodrug of SN-38 be Efficacious in Sacituzumab Govitecan-Resistant Tumors?
Abstract: We previously proposed that sacituzumab govitecan (SG, Trodelvy®) likely acts as a simple prodrug of systemic SN-38 as well as an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). In the present commentary, we assess whether a long-acting SN-38 prodrug, such as PLX038, might be efficacious in SG-resistant patients. We first describe possible mechanisms of action of SG, with new insights on pharmacokinetics and TROP2 receptor occupancy. We argue that SG is not an optimal conventional ADC and that the amount of systemic SN-38 spontaneously hydrolyzed from the ADC is so high it must have activity. Then, we describe the concept of time-over-target as related to the pharmacology of SG and PLX038 as SN-38 prodrugs. To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting that PLX038 or any SN-38 prodrug is superior to SG as an anticancer agent. Clearly, SG has the benefit over antigen-independent SN-38 prodrugs in that it targets cells with the TROP2 receptor. However, we surmise that PLX038 should be a more efficacious and less toxic prodrug of systemic SN-38 than SG. Finally, we suggest possible mechanisms of SG resistance and how PLX038 might perform in the context of each. Taken together, we argue that-contrary to many opinions-SG does not exclusively act as a conventional ADC, and propose that PLX038 may be efficacious in some settings of SG-resistance.

Title: Human breast cancer: correlation of relapse and survival with amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene.
Abstract: The HER-2/neu oncogene is a member of the erbB-like oncogene family, and is related to, but distinct from, the epidermal growth factor receptor. This gene has been shown to be amplified in human breast cancer cell lines. In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189 primary human breast cancers were investigated. HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance even when adjustments were made for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that this gene may play a role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of human breast cancer.

Title: OX40 in the Pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis-A New Therapeutic Target.
Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, heterogeneous, inflammatory disease characterized by skin lesions, pruritus, and pain. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD experience chronic symptoms, intensified by unpredictable flares, and often have comorbidities and secondary complications, which can result in significant clinical burden that impacts the patient's overall quality of life. The complex interplay of immune dysregulation and skin barrier disruption drives AD pathogenesis, of which T-cell-dependent inflammation plays a critical role in patients with AD. Despite new targeted therapies, many patients with moderate-to-severe AD fail to achieve or sustain their individual treatment goals and/or may not be suitable for or tolerate these therapies. There remains a need for a novel, efficacious, well-tolerated therapeutic option that can deliver durable benefits across a heterogeneous AD patient population. Expression of OX40 [tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (TNFRSF4)], a prominent T-cell co-stimulatory molecule, and its ligand [OX40L; tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4)] is increased in AD. As the OX40 pathway is critical for expansion, differentiation, and survival of effector and memory T cells, its targeting might be a promising therapeutic approach to provide sustained inhibition of pathogenic T cells and associated inflammation and broad disease control. Antibodies against OX40 [rocatinlimab (AMG 451/KHK4083) and telazorlimab (GBR 830)] or OX40L [amlitelimab (KY1005)] have shown promising results in early-phase clinical studies of moderate-to-severe AD, highlighting the importance of OX40 signaling as a new therapeutic target in AD.

Title: Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.
Abstract: The National High Blood Pressure Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.

Title: Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) from an Interventionalist Perspective.
Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly among women < 50 years of age. Here, we aim to review the pathogenesis of SCAD, discuss SCAD as an initial manifestation of systemic arterial disease, and highlight invasive strategies as well as unique challenges in the care of women with SCAD. A paradigm shift has occurred in the care of SCAD patients in the past decade as recommendations for conservative management have become widespread. Invasive interventions are reserved for patients with hemodynamic compromise or active ischemia due to increased periprocedural complications and failure rates. Certain patient populations have been identified for larger territory infarcts and proximal disease including patients with known connective tissue disease, premenopausal women, and patients with pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD). Current recommended management of SCAD is conservative. Despite a growing awareness of SCAD and its known association with systemic arteriopathies in women, evidence-based data remains scarce. Future studies focused on identifying genetic factors, optimal medical therapy after SCAD, and techniques to minimize interventional complications are needed.

Title: Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor underlying responsiveness of non-small-cell lung cancer to gefitinib.
Abstract: Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have no response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P<0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.

Title: Rates of Lower Respiratory Tract Illness in US Adults by Age and Comorbidity Profile.
Abstract: While it is widely recognized that older adults, adults with chronic medical conditions (CMC), and adults with immunocompromising conditions (IC) are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), evidence of the magnitude of increased risk is limited. This study was thus undertaken to characterize rates of hospitalized and ambulatory LRTI among United States (US) adults by age and comorbidity profile. A retrospective cohort design and US healthcare claims database (2016-2019) were employed. Study population included adults aged ≥ 18 years and was stratified by age and comorbidity profile (CMC-, CMC+ , IC). LRTI was ascertained overall and by pathogen pathogen (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), and was classified by care setting (hospital, emergency department [ED], physician office/hospital outpatient [PO/HO]). Relative rates (RR) of LRTI generally increased with older age across care settings (vs. 18-49 years), with the most marked increase for hospitalizations: for LRTI-hospitalized, RRs ranged from 3.3 for 50-64 years to 46.6 for ≥ 85 years; for LRTI-ED and LRTI-PO/HO, RRs ranged from 1.0 to 2.7 and from 1.3 to 1.5, respectively. Within age groups, LRTI rates were also consistently higher among CMC+ and IC adults (vs. CMC- adults). Age-specific RRs of LRTI patients hospitalized due to RSV were largely comparable to overall LRTI; age-specific RRs for other care settings, and RRs for CMC+ and IC adults (vs. CMC- adults), were generally higher for LRTI due to RSV. Incidence of LRTI, including that due to RSV, especially for events requiring acute inpatient care, is markedly higher among older adults and adults of all ages with CMC or IC.

Title: Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S).
Abstract: Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444 patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5.4 years median follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%) in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.85, p = 0.0003). The 6-year probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin groups were 87.6% and 91.3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths, respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.75, p < 0.00001), and the respective probabilities of escaping such events were 70.5% and 79.6%. This risk was also significantly reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p < 0.00001) in the risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures. This study shows that long-term treatment with simvastatin is safe and improves survival in CHD patients.

Title: Iron and erythropoietin to heal and recover after intensive care (ITHRIVE): A pilot randomised clinical trial.
Abstract: To determine the feasibility of a pivotal randomised clinical trial of intravenous (IV) iron and erythropoietin in adult survivors of critical illness with anaemia requiring treatment in the intensive care unit. An investigator-initiated, parallel group, placebo-controlled, randomised feasibility trial. A tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) in Perth, Western Australia. Adults with anaemia (haemoglobin <100 g/L), requiring ICU-level care for more than 48 h, and likely to be ready for ICU discharge within 24 h. A single dose of IV ferric carboxymaltose and Epoetin alfa (active group) or an equal volume of 0.9% saline (placebo group). Study feasibility was considered met if the pilot achieved a recruitment rate of ≥2 participants per site per month, ≥90% of participants received their allocated study treatment, and≥ 90% of participants were followed up for the proposed pivotal trial primary outcome - days alive and at home to day 90 (DAH<sub>90</sub>). The 40-participant planned sample size included twenty in each group and was enrolled between 1/9/2021 and 2/3/2022. Participants spent a median of 3.4 days (interquartile range 2.8-5.1) in the ICU prior to enrolment and had a mean baseline haemoglobin of 83.7 g/L (standard deviation 6.7). The recruitment rate was 6.7 participants per month [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8-9.0], DAH<sub>90</sub> follow-up was 100% (95% CI 91.2%-100%), and 39 (97.5%, 95% CI 86.8%-99.9%) participants received the allocated study intervention. No serious adverse events were reported. The iron and erythropoietin to heal and recover after intensive care (ITHRIVE) pilot demonstrated feasibility based on predefined participant recruitment, study drug administration, and follow-up thresholds.

Title: Sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Abstract: No effective systemic therapy exists for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A preliminary study suggested that sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Raf may be effective in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this multicenter, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 602 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment to receive either sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary outcomes were overall survival and the time to symptomatic progression. Secondary outcomes included the time to radiologic progression and safety. At the second planned interim analysis, 321 deaths had occurred, and the study was stopped. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression (4.1 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively, P=0.77). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (P<0.001). Seven patients in the sorafenib group (2%) and two patients in the placebo group (1%) had a partial response; no patients had a complete response. Diarrhea, weight loss, hand-foot skin reaction, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent in the sorafenib group. In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, median survival and the time to radiologic progression were nearly 3 months longer for patients treated with sorafenib than for those given placebo.

Title: Evaluation of renal circulation in heart failure using superb microvascular imaging, a microvascular flow imaging system.
Abstract: Renal circulation evaluation is essential in understanding the cardiorenal relationship in heart failure (HF), and there is a growing interest in imaging techniques that visualize renal circulation. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of superb microvascular imaging (SMI) in evaluating renal circulation in HF patients. The study included 71 HF patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Prior to catheterization, renal ultrasound examinations were performed. A control group of 18 subjects without HF was also included. SMI was used to measure the vascular index (VI), which was calculated as the percentage of blood flow signal area in the region of interest. The intrarenal perfusion index (IRPI) was determined as a fluctuation index of VI, reflecting variations in the number of blood cells moving through renal tissue during the cardiac cycle. Using the upper 95% confidence interval of IRPI (0.6) from the control group, HF patients were classified into two groups. Patients with IRPI > 0.6 showed a more congestive profile. Right atrial pressure and biphasic or monophasic Doppler intrarenal flow pattern were independent determinants of IRPI > 0.6. In addition, IRPI remained a significant predictor of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The parameter IRPI as variations in SMI signal during the cardiac cycle may be a useful evaluation method for renal perfusion impairment in HF.

Title: The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).
Abstract: Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination. To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock. A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment). Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant. Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.

Title: Evaluation of the introduction of novel potassium binders in routine care; the Stockholm CREAtinine measurements (SCREAM) project.
Abstract: The pharmacological management of hyperkalemia traditionally considered calcium or sodium polystyrene sulfonate and, since recently, the novel binders patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. We evaluated their patterns of use, duration of treatment and relative effectiveness/safety in Swedish routine care. Observational study of adults initiating therapy with sodium polystyrene sulfonate or a novel binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate or patiromer) in Stockholm 2019-2021. We quantified treatment duration by repeated dispensations, compared mean achieved potassium concentration within 60 days, and potential adverse events between treatments. A total of 1879 adults started treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and 147 with novel binders (n = 41 patiromer and n = 106 sodium zirconium cyclosilicate). Potassium at baseline for all treatments was 5.7 mmol/L. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate patients stayed on treatment a mean of 61 days (14% filled ≥3 consecutive prescriptions) compared to 109 days on treatment (49% filled ≥3 prescriptions) for novel binders. After 15 days of treatment, potassium similarly decreased to 4.6 (SD 0.6) and 4.8 (SD 0.6) mmol/L in the sodium polystyrene sulfonate and novel binder groups, respectively, and was maintained over the 60 days post-treatment. In multivariable regression, the odds ratio for novel binders (vs sodium polystyrene sulfonate) in reaching potassium ≤ 5.0 mmol/L after 15 days was 0.65 (95% CI 0.38-1.10) and after 60 days 0.89 (95% CI 0.45-1.76). Hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and initiation of anti-diarrheal/constipation medications were the most-commonly detected adverse events. In multivariable analyses, the OR for these events did not differ between groups. We observed similar short-term effectiveness and safety for all potassium binders. However, treatment duration was longer for novel binders than for sodium polystyrene sulfonate.

Title: Design and analysis of randomized clinical trials requiring prolonged observation of each patient. II. analysis and examples.
Abstract: Part I of this report appeared in the previous issue (Br. J. Cancer (1976) 34,585), and discussed the design of randomized clinical trials. Part II now describes efficient methods of analysis of randomized clinical trials in which we wish to compare the duration of survival (or the time until some other untoward event first occurs) among different groups of patients. It is intended to enable physicians without statistical training either to analyse such data themselves using life tables, the logrank test and retrospective stratification, or, when such analyses are presented, to appreciate them more critically, but the discussion may also be of interest to statisticians who have not yet specialized in clinical trial analyses.

Title: Pregnancy-associated changes in urinary uromodulin excretion in chronic hypertension.
Abstract: Pregnancy involves major adaptations in renal haemodynamics, tubular, and endocrine functions. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Uromodulin is a nephron-derived protein that is associated with hypertension and kidney diseases. Here we study the role of urinary uromodulin excretion in hypertensive pregnancy. Urinary uromodulin was measured by ELISA in 146 pregnant women with treated chronic hypertension (n = 118) and controls (n = 28). We studied non-pregnant and pregnant Wistar Kyoto and Stroke Prone Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (n = 8/strain), among which a group of pregnant Stroke-Prone Spontaneously Hypertensive rats was treated with either nifedipine (n = 7) or propranolol (n = 8). In pregnant women, diagnosis of chronic hypertension, increased maternal body mass index, Black maternal ethnicity and elevated systolic blood pressure at the first antenatal visit were significantly associated with a lower urinary uromodulin-to-creatinine ratio. In rodents, pre-pregnancy urinary uromodulin excretion was twofold lower in Stroke-Prone Spontaneously Hypertensive rats than in Wistar Kyoto rats. During pregnancy, the urinary uromodulin excretion rate gradually decreased in Wistar Kyoto rats (a twofold decrease), whereas a 1.5-fold increase was observed in Stroke-Prone Spontaneously Hypertensive rats compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Changes in uromodulin were attributed by kidney injury in pregnant rats. Neither antihypertensive changed urinary uromodulin excretion rate in pregnant Stroke-Prone Spontaneously Hypertensive rats. In summary, we demonstrate pregnancy-associated differences in urinary uromodulin: creatinine ratio and uromodulin excretion rate between chronic hypertensive and normotensive pregnancies. Further research is needed to fully understand uromodulin physiology in human pregnancy and establish uromodulin's potential as a biomarker for renal adaptation and renal function in pregnancy.

Title: Tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke.
Abstract: Thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke has been approached cautiously because there were high rates of intracerebral hemorrhage in early clinical trials. We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for ischemic stroke after recent pilot studies suggested that t-PA was beneficial when treatment was begun within three hours of the onset of stroke. The trial had two parts. Part 1 (in which 291 patients were enrolled) tested whether t-PA had clinical activity, as indicated by an improvement of 4 points over base-line values in the score of the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) or the resolution of the neurologic deficit within 24 hours of the onset of stroke. Part 2 (in which 333 patients were enrolled) used a global test statistic to assess clinical outcome at three months, according to scores on the Barthel index, modified Rankin scale, Glasgow outcome scale, and NIHSS: In part 1, there was no significant difference between the group given t-PA and that given placebo in the percentages of patients with neurologic improvement at 24 hours, although a benefit was observed for the t-PA group at three months for all four outcome measures. In part 2, the long-term clinical benefit of t-PA predicted by the results of part 1 was confirmed (global odds ratio for a favorable outcome, 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.6). As compared with patients given placebo, patients treated with t-PA were at least 30 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability at three months on the assessment scales. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 36 hours after the onset of stroke occurred in 6.4 percent of patients given t-PA but only 0.6 percent of patients given placebo (P < 0.001). Mortality at three months was 17 percent in the t-PA group and 21 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.30). Despite an increased incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, treatment with intravenous t-PA within three hours of the onset of ischemic stroke improved clinical outcome at three months.

Title: Current cannabis use and pain management among US cancer patients.
Abstract: National studies reporting the prevalence of cannabis use have focused on individuals with a history of cancer without distinction by their treatment status, which can impact symptom burden. While pain is a primary motivation to use cannabis in cancer, the magnitude of its association with cannabis use remains understudied. We examined cannabis use and pain management among 5523 respondents of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System with a cancer history. Survey-weighted prevalence proportions of respondents' cannabis use are reported, stratified on cancer treatment status. Regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer-related pain and cannabis use. Cannabis use was slightly more prevalent in those undergoing active treatment relative to those who were not undergoing active treatment (9.3% vs. 6.2%; P=0.05). Those under active treatment were more likely to use cannabis medicinally (71.6% vs. 50.0%; P=0.03). Relative to those without cancer-related pain, persons with pain under medical control (OR 2.1, 95% CI, 1.4-3.2) or uncontrolled pain were twice as likely to use cannabis (OR 2.0, 95% CI, 1.1-3.5). Use of cannabis among cancer patients may be related to their treatment and is positively associated with cancer-related pain. Future research should investigate the associations of cannabis use, symptom burden, and treatment regimens across the treatment spectrum to facilitate interventions.

Title: Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.
Abstract: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Title: Effects of Sichuan pepper (huājiāo) powder on disease activity and caecal microbiota of dextran sodium sulphate-induced inflammatory bowel disease mouse model.
Abstract: Sichuan pepper [Zanthoxylum bungeanum; huājiāo (HJ)] is a widely used spice in China and has better antioxidative, anti-glycation, and bile acid-lowering properties than cumin and coriander seeds. HJ affects inflammation-related cytokines and caecal microbiota in mice fed a low-fibre and high-sucrose diet. To determine the ameliorative effect of HJ on inflammatory bowel disease, C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups and fed distilled water (control) or 3% (w/v) dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in drinking water with normal chow containing 0% or 5% (w/w) HJ powder for seven days. After 6 days of feeding, diarrhoea, decreased body weight, and blood in faeces were observed in the DSS group. DSS treatment increased the spleen weight and damaged the colon tissue. These inflammatory indices were inhibited by HJ treatment. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rDNA (V4) gene of the caecal content revealed a decrease in the alpha diversity (Simpson index D) in the DSS treatment group compared to the control group. The abundance of caecal Desulfovibrio, an inflammation-related genus, was higher and the caecal Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides levels were lower in the DSS-treated mice than those in the control mice. However, HJ suppressed the DSS-induced changes in the caecal microbiota. HJ intake contributes to the reduction in inflammation and maintenance of the gut microbiota. However, the strong antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds and fermentability of water-soluble dietary fibres in HJ and their relationship with other functional properties warrant further investigation.

Title: Definition, diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. Part 1: diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus provisional report of a WHO consultation.
Abstract: The classification of diabetes mellitus and the tests used for its diagnosis were brought into order by the National Diabetes Data Group of the USA and the second World Health Organization Expert Committee on Diabetes Mellitus in 1979 and 1980. Apart from minor modifications by WHO in 1985, little has been changed since that time. There is however considerable new knowledge regarding the aetiology of different forms of diabetes as well as more information on the predictive value of different blood glucose values for the complications of diabetes. A WHO Consultation has therefore taken place in parallel with a report by an American Diabetes Association Expert Committee to re-examine diagnostic criteria and classification. The present document includes the conclusions of the former and is intended for wide distribution and discussion before final proposals are submitted to WHO for approval. The main changes proposed are as follows. The diagnostic fasting plasma (blood) glucose value has been lowered to > or =7.0 mmol l(-1) (6.1 mmol l(-1)). Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is changed to allow for the new fasting level. A new category of Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG) is proposed to encompass values which are above normal but below the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes (plasma > or =6.1 to <7.0 mmol l(-1); whole blood > or =5.6 to <6.1 mmol l(-1)). Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) now includes gestational impaired glucose tolerance as well as the previous GDM. The classification defines both process and stage of the disease. The processes include Type 1, autoimmune and non-autoimmune, with beta-cell destruction; Type 2 with varying degrees of insulin resistance and insulin hyposecretion; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus; and Other Types where the cause is known (e.g. MODY, endocrinopathies). It is anticipated that this group will expand as causes of Type 2 become known. Stages range from normoglycaemia to insulin required for survival. It is hoped that the new classification will allow better classification of individuals and lead to fewer therapeutic misjudgements.

Title: [<sup>68 </sup>Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT for locoregional lymph node staging in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder prior to cystectomy: initial experiences from a pilot analysis.
Abstract: [<sup>68</sup> Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT is a novel hybrid imaging method that previously showed additional diagnostic value in the assessment of distant urothelial carcinoma lesions. We hypothesized that patients with bladder cancer benefit from [<sup>68</sup> Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT prior to radical cystectomy for locoregional lymph node staging. Eighteen patients underwent [<sup>68</sup> Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT for evaluation of lymph node (LN) status in predefined LN regions. Two hundred twenty-nine intraoperatively removed LN served as histopathological reference standard. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) spread was found in ten LN in seven different regions (14.3%). Hereby, [<sup>68</sup> Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT was positive in four out of seven regions (57.1%) and showed significantly increased FAPI uptake compared to non-pathological regions. In the remaining three out of seven (42.9%) regions, [<sup>68</sup> Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT was rated negative since no pathological increased FAPI uptake was detected or the proximity of the urinary tract prevented a differentiation from physiological uptake. CT was inconspicuous in these three regions. In total, two FAP-positive LN regions were found without histopathological counterpart. Overall, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 57.1%, 95.2%, 66.7%, and 93.0% for PET imaging. In summary, this innovative [<sup>68</sup> Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT method showed high specificity and negative predictive value in patients with bladder UC with a future potential to optimize therapy planning.

Title: Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer.
Abstract: Blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed by T cells, can overcome immune resistance. We assessed the antitumor activity and safety of BMS-936558, an antibody that specifically blocks PD-1. We enrolled patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer to receive anti-PD-1 antibody at a dose of 0.1 to 10.0 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks. Response was assessed after each 8-week treatment cycle. Patients received up to 12 cycles until disease progression or a complete response occurred. A total of 296 patients received treatment through February 24, 2012. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients; there were three deaths from pulmonary toxicity. No maximum tolerated dose was defined. Adverse events consistent with immune-related causes were observed. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. Cumulative response rates (all doses) were 18% among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (14 of 76 patients), 28% among patients with melanoma (26 of 94 patients), and 27% among patients with renal-cell cancer (9 of 33 patients). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or more in patients with 1 year or more of follow-up. To assess the role of intratumoral PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in the modulation of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on pretreatment tumor specimens obtained from 42 patients. Of 17 patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, none had an objective response; 9 of 25 patients (36%) with PD-L1-positive tumors had an objective response (P=0.006). Anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; the adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and objective response. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730639.).

Title: Low-flow in aortic valve stenosis patients with reduced ejection fraction does not depend on left ventricular function.
Abstract: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) can be distinguished into high- (HG) and low-gradient (LG) subgroups. However, less is known about their characteristics and underlying (pathophysiological) hemodynamic mechanisms. 98 AS patients with reduced LVEF were included. Subgroup characteristics were analyzed by a multimodal approach using clinical and histological data, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and applying echocardiography as well as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Biopsy samples were analyzed with respect to fibrosis and mRNA expression profiles. 40 patients were classified as HG-AS and 58 patients as LG-AS. Severity of AS was comparable between the subgroups. Comparison of both subgroups revealed no differences in LVEF (p = 0.1), LV mass (p = 0.6) or end-diastolic LV diameter (p = 0.12). Neither histological (HG: 23.2% vs. LG: 25.6%, p = 0.73) and circulating biomarker-based assessment (HG: 2.6 ± 2.2% vs. LG: 3.2 ± 3.1%; p = 0.46) of myocardial fibrosis nor global gene expression patterns differed between subgroups. Mitral regurgitation (MR), atrial fibrillation (AF) and impaired right ventricular function (MR: HG: 8% vs. LG: 24%; p < 0.001; AF: HG: 30% vs. LG: 51.7%; p = 0.03; RVSVi: HG 36.7 vs. LG 31.1 ml/m2, p = 0.045; TAPSE: HG 20.2 vs. LG 17.3 mm, p = 0.002) were more frequent in LG-AS patients compared to HG-AS. These pathologies could explain the higher mortality of LG vs. HG-AS patients. In patients with low-flow severe aortic stenosis, low transaortic gradient and cardiac output are not primarily due to LV dysfunction or global changes in gene expression, but may be attributed to other additional cardiac pathologies like mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation or right ventricular dysfunction. These factors should also be considered during planning of aortic valve replacement.

Title: Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks.
Abstract: Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.

Title: Restraining of glycoprotein VI- and integrin α2β1-dependent thrombus formation by platelet PECAM1.
Abstract: The platelet receptors, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin α2β1 jointly control collagen-dependent thrombus formation via protein tyrosine kinases. It is unresolved to which extent the ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) receptor PECAM1 and its downstream acting protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 interfere in this process. Here, we hypothesized that integrin α2β1 has a co-regulatory role in the PECAM1- and PTPN11-dependent restraint of thrombus formation. We investigated platelet activation under flow on collagens with a different GPVI dependency and using integrin α2β1 blockage. Blood was obtained from healthy subjects and from patients with Noonan syndrome with a gain-of-function mutation of PTPN11 and variable bleeding phenotype. On collagens with decreasing GPVI activity (types I, III, IV), the surface-dependent inhibition of PECAM1 did not alter thrombus parameters using control blood. Blockage of α2β1 generally reduced thrombus parameters, most effectively on collagen IV. Strikingly, simultaneous inhibition of PECAM1 and α2β1 led to a restoration of thrombus formation, indicating that the suppressing signaling effect of PECAM1 is masked by the platelet-adhesive receptor α2β1. Blood from 4 out of 6 Noonan patients showed subnormal thrombus formation on collagen IV. In these patients, effects of α2β1 blockage were counterbalanced by PECAM1 inhibition to a normal phenotype. In summary, we conclude that the suppression of GPVI-dependent thrombus formation by either PECAM1 or a gain-of-function of PTPN11 can be overruled by α2β1 engagement.

Title: Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.
Abstract: The HER2 gene, which encodes the growth factor receptor HER2, is amplified and HER2 is overexpressed in 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers, increasing the aggressiveness of the tumor. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or with trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

Title: Cost-utility analysis of Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring versus FreeStyle Libre 1 intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring in adults with type 1 diabetes in Belgium.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) with alert functionality compared with FreeStyle Libre 1 intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) without alerts in adults with type 1 diabetes in Belgium. The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. Input data for the simulated baseline cohort were sourced from the randomised ALERTT1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT03772600). The age of the participants was 42.9 ± 14.1 years (mean ± SD), and the baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 57.8 ± 9.5 mmol/mol (7.4 ± 0.9%). Participants using rtCGM showed a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 3.6 mmol/mol (0.36 percentage points) based on the 6-month mean between-group difference. In the base case, both rtCGM and isCGM were priced at €3.92/day (excluding value-added tax [VAT]) according to the Belgian reimbursement system. The analysis was performed from a Belgian healthcare payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon. Health outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were used to account for parameter uncertainty. In the base case, rtCGM dominated isCGM, resulting in lower diabetes-related complication costs and better health outcomes. The associated main drivers favouring rtCGM were lower HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fewer severe hypoglycaemic events and reduced fear of hypoglycaemia. The results were robust under a wide range of one-way sensitivity analyses. In models where the price of rtCGM is €5.11/day (a price increase of 30.4%) or €12.34/day (a price increase of 214.8%), rtCGM was cost-neutral or reached an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €40,000 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. When priced similarly, Dexcom G6 rtCGM with alert functionality has both economic and clinical benefits compared with FreeStyle Libre 1 isCGM without alerts in adults with type 1 diabetes in Belgium, and appears to be a cost-effective glucose monitoring modality. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03772600.

Title: Chronic kidney disease and the risks of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization.
Abstract: End-stage renal disease substantially increases the risks of death, cardiovascular disease, and use of specialized health care, but the effects of less severe kidney dysfunction on these outcomes are less well defined. We estimated the longitudinal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among 1,120,295 adults within a large, integrated system of health care delivery in whom serum creatinine had been measured between 1996 and 2000 and who had not undergone dialysis or kidney transplantation. We examined the multivariable association between the estimated GFR and the risks of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization. The median follow-up was 2.84 years, the mean age was 52 years, and 55 percent of the group were women. After adjustment, the risk of death increased as the GFR decreased below 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area: the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.2 with an estimated GFR of 45 to 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.2), 1.8 with an estimated GFR of 30 to 44 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 1.9), 3.2 with an estimated GFR of 15 to 29 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 3.4), and 5.9 with an estimated GFR of less than 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 6.5). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular events also increased inversely with the estimated GFR: 1.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 1.5), 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 2.1), 2.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 2.9), and 3.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 3.8), respectively. The adjusted risk of hospitalization with a reduced estimated GFR followed a similar pattern. An independent, graded association was observed between a reduced estimated GFR and the risk of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization in a large, community-based population. These findings highlight the clinical and public health importance of chronic renal insufficiency.

Title: Genetic engineering of regulatory T cells for treatment of autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes.
Abstract: Suppression of pathogenic immune responses is a major goal in the prevention and treatment of type 1 diabetes. Adoptive cell therapy using regulatory T cells (Tregs), a naturally suppressive immune subset that is often dysfunctional in type 1 diabetes, is a promising approach to achieving localised and specific immune suppression in the pancreas or site of islet transplant. However, clinical trials testing administration of polyclonal Tregs in recent-onset type 1 diabetes have observed limited efficacy despite an excellent safety profile. Several barriers to efficacy have been identified, including lack of antigen specificity, low cell persistence post-administration and difficulty in generating sufficient cell numbers. Fortunately, the emergence of advanced gene editing techniques has opened the door to new strategies to engineer Tregs with improved specificity and function. These strategies include the engineering of FOXP3 expression to produce a larger source of suppressive cells for infusion, expressing T cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors to generate antigen-specific Tregs and improving Treg survival by targeting cytokine pathways. Although these approaches are being applied in a variety of autoimmune and transplant contexts, type 1 diabetes presents unique opportunities and challenges for the genetic engineering of Tregs for adoptive cell therapy. Here we discuss the role of Tregs in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and the application of Treg engineering in the context of type 1 diabetes.

Title: Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. HIV Outpatient Study Investigators.
Abstract: National surveillance data show recent, marked reductions in morbidity and mortality associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). To evaluate these declines, we analyzed data on 1255 patients, each of whom had at least one CD4+ count below 100 cells per cubic millimeter, who were seen at nine clinics specializing in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in eight U.S. cities from January 1994 through June 1997. Mortality among the patients declined from 29.4 per 100 person-years in the first quarter of 1995 to 8.8 per 100 in the second quarter of 1997. There were reductions in mortality regardless of sex, race, age, and risk factors for transmission of HIV. The incidence of any of three major opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex disease, and cytomegalovirus retinitis) declined from 21.9 per 100 person-years in 1994 to 3.7 per 100 person-years by mid-1997. In a failure-rate model, increases in the intensity of antiretroviral therapy (classified as none, monotherapy, combination therapy without a protease inhibitor, and combination therapy with a protease inhibitor) were associated with stepwise reductions in morbidity and mortality. Combination antiretroviral therapy was associated with the most benefit; the inclusion of protease inhibitors in such regimens conferred additional benefit. Patients with private insurance were more often prescribed protease inhibitors and had lower mortality rates than those insured by Medicare or Medicaid. The recent declines in morbidity and mortality due to AIDS are attributable to the use of more intensive antiretroviral therapies.

Title: Opportunistically identifiable vertebral fractures on routine radiological imaging predict mortality: observational cohort study.
Abstract: In men and women with opportunistically identifiable vertebral fractures (VFs) on routine CT scans including the chest and/or abdomen, the risk of death is 51% higher than in those with no VF on the CT scan, and 325% higher than an age- and sex-matched general population cohort. There is little knowledge about the risk of death in patients with VFs present on routine radiological imaging. We evaluated the risk of death in men and women aged 50 years or older with opportunistically identifiable VFs on routine CT scans and not treated with osteoporosis medications. Thoracic and lumbar VFs were identified through a blinded, two-step approach on CT scans performed as part of normal clinical care in a Danish hospital in 2010 or later. Subjects with VF were matched on age and sex against those with no VF (1:2-ratio) and a general population cohort (1:3-ratio), respectively, and followed for up to 7 years through the national Danish registers. Subjects treated with an osteoporosis medication in the year prior to baseline were excluded. Subjects with VF had a significantly higher risk of death during follow-up as compared to subjects with no VF on the CT scan (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.51 [95% confidence interval 1.27-1.79; p < 0.001]) and even more so when compared to the general population cohort (HR 4.25 [3.53-5.12; p < 0.001]). In subjects with versus without VF on the CT scan, the risk was higher in those with moderate or severe VF, in those with no malignancy prior to baseline, and in those with a lower Charlson comorbidity index score. Subjects with VF available for identification on routine CT scans face a substantially increased risk of death. Opportunistic identification and reporting of VF is important to identify these patients to allow intervention if indicated.

Title: Mitochondria and apoptosis.
Abstract: A variety of key events in apoptosis focus on mitochondria, including the release of caspase activators (such as cytochrome c), changes in electron transport, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, altered cellular oxidation-reduction, and participation of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. The different signals that converge on mitochondria to trigger or inhibit these events and their downstream effects delineate several major pathways in physiological cell death.

Title: Antiosteoporosis therapy after discontinuation of menopausal hormone therapy: a systematic review.
Abstract: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has consistently shown a bone protective effect by reducing the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures in postmenopausal women regardless of baseline fracture risk. However, the optimal sequential treatment after MHT discontinuation has not been determined. This systematic review aimed to obtain the best evidence regarding the effect of antiresorptive or osteoanabolic treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) and/or fracture risk following MHT. A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases up to October 31, 2023. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies conducted in postmenopausal women were included. After the exclusion of duplicates, 717 studies were identified. Two were eligible for qualitative analysis, one RCT and one retrospective cohort study. The RCT showed that alendronate 10 mg/day for 12 months further increased lumbar spine (LS) BMD by 2.3% following MHT and maintained femoral neck (FN) BMD in postmenopausal women (n = 144). It also decreased bone anabolic and resorption markers by 47 and 36%, respectively. In the retrospective study (n = 34), raloxifene 60 mg/day increased both LS and FN BMD at 12 months by 3 and 2.9%, respectively. No fractures were reported. Antiresorptive therapy with either a bisphosphonate (i.e., alendronate) or raloxifene could be considered a sequential antiosteoporosis therapy after MHT withdrawal since they have been shown in studies to further increase BMD. However, no safe conclusions can be drawn from the existing literature.

Title: EGFR mutations in lung cancer: correlation with clinical response to gefitinib therapy.
Abstract: Receptor tyrosine kinase genes were sequenced in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and matched normal tissue. Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR were found in 15of 58 unselected tumors from Japan and 1 of 61 from the United States. Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines. These results suggest that EGFR mutations may predict sensitivity to gefitinib.

Title: Mean arterial pressure to norepinephrine equivalent dose ratio for predicting renal replacement therapy requirement: a retrospective analysis from the MIMIC-IV.
Abstract: This study aimed to assess the predictive value of the ratio of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the corresponding peak rate of norepinephrine equivalent dose (NEQ) within the first day in patients with shock for the subsequent renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement. Patients were identified using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The relationship was investigated using a restricted cubic spline curve, and propensity score matching(PSM) was used to eliminate differences between groups. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression. Variable significance was assessed using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. Of the 5775 patients, 301 (5.2%) received RRT. The MAP/NEQ index showed a declining L-shaped relationship for RRT. After PSM, the adjusted OR per 100 mmHg/mcg/kg/min for RRT was 0.93(95% CI 0.88-0.98). The most influential factors for RRT were fluid balance, baseline creatinine, and the MAP/NEQ index. The threshold for the MAP/NEQ index predicting RRT was 161.7 mmHg/mcg/kg/min (specificity: 65.8%, sensitivity: 74.8%) with an area under the ROC curve of 75.9% (95% CI 73.1-78.8). The MAP/NEQ index served as an alternative predictor of RRT necessity based on the NEQ for adult patients who received at least one vasopressor over 6 h within the first 24 h of intensive care unit(ICU) admission. Dynamic modulation of the MAP/NEQ index by the synergistic use of various low-dose vasopressors targeting urine output may be beneficial for exploring individualized optimization of MAP.

Title: Dabigatran versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.
Abstract: Warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but increases the risk of hemorrhage and is difficult to use. Dabigatran is a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor. In this noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned 18,113 patients who had atrial fibrillation and a risk of stroke to receive, in a blinded fashion, fixed doses of dabigatran--110 mg or 150 mg twice daily--or, in an unblinded fashion, adjusted-dose warfarin. The median duration of the follow-up period was 2.0 years. The primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. Rates of the primary outcome were 1.69% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 1.53% per year in the group that received 110 mg of dabigatran (relative risk with dabigatran, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.11; P<0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.11% per year in the group that received 150 mg of dabigatran (relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.82; P<0.001 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 3.36% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 2.71% per year in the group receiving 110 mg of dabigatran (P=0.003) and 3.11% per year in the group receiving 150 mg of dabigatran (P=0.31). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.38% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 0.12% per year with 110 mg of dabigatran (P<0.001) and 0.10% per year with 150 mg of dabigatran (P<0.001). The mortality rate was 4.13% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 3.75% per year with 110 mg of dabigatran (P=0.13) and 3.64% per year with 150 mg of dabigatran (P=0.051). In patients with atrial fibrillation, dabigatran given at a dose of 110 mg was associated with rates of stroke and systemic embolism that were similar to those associated with warfarin, as well as lower rates of major hemorrhage. Dabigatran administered at a dose of 150 mg, as compared with warfarin, was associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism but similar rates of major hemorrhage.

Title: Bezlotoxumab during the first episode of Clostridioides difficile infection in patients at high risk of recurrence.
Abstract: To describe a cohort with a high risk of recurrence who received bezlotoxumab during the first episode of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and to compare this cohort with patients with similar characteristics who did not receive the monoclonal antibody. A prospective and multicentre study of patients with a high risk of recurrence (expected recurrence rate>35%) who were treated with bezlotoxumab during their first episode of CDI was conducted. A propensity score-matched model 1:2 was used to compare both cohorts that were weighed according to basal characteristics (hospital-acquisition, creatinine value, and fidaxomicin as a CDI treatment). Sixty patients (mean age:72 years) were prospectively treated with bezlotoxumab plus anti-Clostridioides antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin (48 patients) and fidaxomicin (12 patients) were prescribed for CDI treatment, and bezlotoxumab was administered at a mean of 4.2 (SD:2.1) days from the beginning of therapy. Recurrence occurred in nine out of 54 (16.7%) evaluable patients at 8 weeks. Forty bezlotoxumab-treated patients were matched with 69 non-bezlotoxumab-treated patients. Recurrence rates at 12 weeks were 15.0% (6/40) in bezlotoxumab-treated patients vs. 23.2% (16/69) in non-bezlotoxumab-treated patients (OR:0.58 [0.20-1.65]). No adverse effects were observed related to bezlotoxumab infusion. Only one of 9 patients with previous heart failure developed heart failure. We observed that patients treated with bezlotoxumab in a real-world setting during a first episode of CDI having high risk of recurrence, presented low rate of recurrence. However, a significant difference in recurrence could not be proved in comparison to the controls. We did not detect any other safety concerns.

Title: The blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy.
Abstract: Among the most promising approaches to activating therapeutic antitumour immunity is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage. It is now clear that tumours co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance antitumour immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.

Title: Tremelimumab: A Review in Advanced or Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
Abstract: Tremelimumab (tremelimumab-actl; Imjudo<sup>®</sup>) is a monoclonal antibody and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that blocks cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). A single, priming dose of intravenous tremelimumab is used in combination with durvalumab, an ICI that blocks programmed cell-death ligand 1, in a regimen known as STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab). STRIDE is approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the USA and Japan and for the first-line treatment of adults with advanced or unresectable HCC in Europe. In the phase III HIMALAYA trial, STRIDE significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared with sorafenib in adults with unresectable HCC and no prior systemic therapy. A higher proportion of STRIDE versus sorafenib recipients had an objective response to treatment. The OS benefit associated with STRIDE was sustained with 4 years' follow-up. STRIDE had a manageable safety profile that differed from that of sorafenib. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in a lower proportion of STRIDE versus sorafenib recipients. Based on the available evidence, tremelimumab used as part of the STRIDE regimen is a valuable first-line agent that expands the treatment options available to patients with advanced or unresectable HCC.

Title: The occurrence of sleep-disordered breathing among middle-aged adults.
Abstract: Limited data have suggested that sleep-disordered breathing, a condition of repeated episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep, is prevalent among adults. Data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of the natural history of cardiopulmonary disorders of sleep, were used to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing among adults and address its importance to the public health. A random sample of 602 employed men and women 30 to 60 years old were studied by overnight polysomnography to determine the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep (the apnea-hypopnea score). We measured the age- and sex-specific prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in this group using three cutoff points for the apnea-hypopnea score (> or = 5, > or = 10, and > or = 15); we used logistic regression to investigate risk factors. The estimated prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, defined as an apnea-hypopnea score of 5 or higher, was 9 percent for women and 24 percent for men. We estimated that 2 percent of women and 4 percent of men in the middle-aged work force meet the minimal diagnostic criteria for the sleep apnea syndrome (an apnea-hypopnea score of 5 or higher and daytime hypersomnolence). Male sex and obesity were strongly associated with the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Habitual snorers, both men and women, tended to have a higher prevalence of apnea-hypopnea scores of 15 or higher. The prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing is high among men and is much higher than previously suspected among women. Undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing is associated with daytime hypersomnolence.

Title: The value of ultrasound enhancing agents in the echocardiographic acquisition of pulmonary artery systolic pressure: An invasive to non-invasive correlation study.
Abstract: Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard for the assessment of pulmonary artery systolic pressures (PASP). Despite high utilization of echocardiography for the non-invasive assessment of PASP, the data comparing real-time non-invasive echocardiographic PASP with invasive PASP is limited. Furthermore, evidence regarding the utility and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound enhancing agents (UEA) for non-invasive PASP assessment is lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of non-invasive PASP assessment with real-time invasive measures and the incremental benefit of UEA in this setting. This was a prospective cohort study of 90 patients, undergoing clinically indicated RHC for hemodynamic assessment. All patients underwent a limited echocardiogram during RHC. Tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) was measured on unenhanced echo, in the setting of centrally administrated agitated saline, then as either centrally administered or peripherally administered UEA. Of the 90 patients enrolled in our study, 41% had pulmonary hypertension. The overall mean PASP measured by RHC was 32.8 mmHg (+/- 11.3 mmHg). Unenhanced echocardiograms had a moderate correlation with invasive PASP (r = 0.57; p = < 0.001) which improved to a strong correlation with administration of agitated saline (r = 0.75; p = < 0.001) or centrally administered UEA (r = 0.77; p = < 0.001), with the best correlation noted with peripherally administered UEA (r = 0.83; p = < 0.001). Against invasive PASP, agitated saline enhanced PASP had the lowest bias (0.12mmHg; -15.6 to 15.8mmHg) when compared with all other non-invasive measures of PASP. Unenhanced echocardiographic estimation of TRV was found to have a poorer correlation with invasively measured PASP when compared to agitated saline and centrally administered UEA. Agitated saline enhanced PASP demonstrated the lowest bias with invasive PASP when compared to other non-invasive measures of PASP.

Title: Free radicals and antioxidants in normal physiological functions and human disease.
Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO(*)) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain ""redox balance"" termed also ""redox homeostasis"". The ""two-faced"" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular ""redox homeostasis""; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury.

Title: Lactate dehydrogenase A promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression through the TAK1/NF-κB Axis.
Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that originates in the nasopharyngeal mucosa and is common in China and Southeast Asian countries. Cancer cells reprogram glycolytic metabolism to promote their growth, survival and metastasis. Glycolysis plays an important role in NPC development, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a crucial glycolytic enzyme, catalyzing the last step of glycolysis. This study aims to investigate the exact role of LDHA, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, in NPC development. The western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) results indicated that LDHA was significantly upregulated in NPC cells and clinical samples. LDHA knockdown by shRNA significantly inhibited NPC cell proliferation and invasion. Further knockdown of LDHA dramatically weakened the tumorigenicity of NPC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that LDHA activated TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and subsequent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling to promote NPC cell proliferation and invasion. Exogenous lactate supplementation restored NPC cell proliferation and invasion inhibited by LDHA knockdown, and this restorative effect was reversed by NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082) or TAK1 inhibitor (5Z-7-oxozeaenol) treatment. Moreover, clinical sample analyses showed that LDHA expression was positively correlated with TAK1 Thr187 phosphorylation and poor prognosis. Our results suggest that LDHA and its major metabolite lactate drive NPC progression by regulating TAK1 and its downstream NF-κB signaling, which could become a therapeutic target in NPC.

Title: Development of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT): WHO Collaborative Project on Early Detection of Persons with Harmful Alcohol Consumption--II.
Abstract: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) has been developed from a six-country WHO collaborative project as a screening instrument for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. It is a 10-item questionnaire which covers the domains of alcohol consumption, drinking behaviour, and alcohol-related problems. Questions were selected from a 150-item assessment schedule (which was administered to 1888 persons attending representative primary health care facilities) on the basis of their representativeness for these conceptual domains and their perceived usefulness for intervention. Responses to each question are scored from 0 to 4, giving a maximum possible score of 40. Among those diagnosed as having hazardous or harmful alcohol use, 92% had an AUDIT score of 8 or more, and 94% of those with non-hazardous consumption had a score of less than 8. AUDIT provides a simple method of early detection of hazardous and harmful alcohol use in primary health care settings and is the first instrument of its type to be derived on the basis of a cross-national study.

Title: Heavy Alcohol Use and HIV Outcomes: The Moderating Role of Pain.
Abstract: Pain and heavy alcohol consumption are prevalent among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), each contributing to impaired functioning and diminished quality of life. Each of these conditions may have negative effects on the HIV care continuum, but less is known about their combined influences. The current study examined how heavy drinking and pain were associated with HIV viral suppression and CD4 cell count among participants receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The study sample consisted of 220 PLWH with past 12-month substance dependence or ever injection drug use enrolled in a large HIV cohort study. Logistic regression analyses showed an interaction between pain level (no/mild pain vs moderate/severe) and heavy drinking on viral suppression such that heavy drinking was a significant predictor of poorer viral suppression only for those who experienced moderate/severe pain. We also examined whether ART adherence differentially mediated the association between heavy drinking and HIV viral suppression by level of pain. Although there was a significant indirect effect of heavy drinking on viral suppression among those with moderate/severe pain, moderated mediational analyses did not indicate that the indirect effect of heavy drinking on viral suppression through ART adherence differed significantly by level of pain. Pain level did not significantly moderate the association between heavy drinking and CD4 cell count. We conclude that heavy drinking may be particularly likely to be associated with poorer HIV viral suppression among PLWH with moderate or severe pain. Providers should routinely address comorbid heavy drinking and pain to improve HIV outcomes.

Title: Isolation of putative progenitor endothelial cells for angiogenesis.
Abstract: Putative endothelial cell (EC) progenitors or angioblasts were isolated from human peripheral blood by magnetic bead selection on the basis of cell surface antigen expression. In vitro, these cells differentiated into ECs. In animal models of ischemia, heterologous, homologous, and autologous EC progenitors incorporated into sites of active angiogenesis. These findings suggest that EC progenitors may be useful for augmenting collateral vessel growth to ischemic tissues (therapeutic angiogenesis) and for delivering anti- or pro-angiogenic agents, respectively, to sites of pathologic or utilitarian angiogenesis.

Title: TLR2 agonist prevents the progression of periapical lesions in mice by reducing osteoclast activity and regulating the frequency of Tregs.
Abstract: To evaluate the role of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in the presence or absence of the synthetic ligand Pam3Cys during the progression of periapical lesion in wild-type (WT) and toll-like receptor 2 knockout (TLR2KO) mice. A total of 130 C57BL/6 male WT and TLR2KO mice were allocated into control (n = 5) and experimental (periapical lesion induction) (n = 10) groups. In specific groups (WT+Pam3cys and TLR2KO+Pam3cys), the synthetic ligand Pam3cys was administered intraperitoneally every 7 days, according to the experimental period (14, 21 and 42 days). At the end of those periods, the animals were euthanized, and the mandible and the spleen were submitted to histotechnical processing. Mandible histological sections were analysed by haematoxylin and eosin, TRAP histoenzymology and immunohistochemistry (FOXP3, RANK, RANKL and OPG). Spleen sections were analysed by immunohistochemistry (FOXP3). The inflammatory infiltrate and bone resorption were more intense in the TLR2KO group compared to the WT group. The animals that received the Pam3cys had smaller periapical lesions when compared to the animals that did not receive the ligand (p < .05). TLR2KO animals showed a significant increase in the number of osteoclasts when compared to TLR2KO+Pam3cys group (p < .05). At 21 days, the WT+Pam3cys group had a lower number of osteoclasts when compared to the WT animals (p = .02). FOXP3 expression was more intense in the WT+Pam3cys groups when compared to the WT animals in the 42 days (p = .03). In the spleen analysis, the WT+Pam3cys group also had a higher expression of FOXP3 when compared to the WT animals at 14 and 42 days (p = .02). Concerning RANKL, there was a reduction in staining in the KOTLR2+Pam3cys groups at 21 and 42 days (p = .03) and a higher binding ratio between RANK/RANKL in animals that did not receive the ligand. Administration of the Pam3cys increased the proliferation of Tregs, showed by FOXP3 expression and prevented the progression of the periapical lesion in WT mice. On the other hand, in the TLR2KO animals, Treg expression was lower with larger areas of periapical lesions. Finally, systemic administration of the Pam3cys in KO animals was able to limit the deleterious effects of the absence of the TLR2 receptor.

Title: Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): case-control study.
Abstract: Although more than 80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Smoking (odds ratio 2.87 for current vs never, PAR 35.7% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49.2% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1.91, PAR 17.9%), diabetes (2.37, PAR 9.9%), abdominal obesity (1.12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1.62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20.1% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2.67, PAR 32.5%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0.70, PAR 13.7% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0.91, PAR 6.7%), and regular physical activity (0.86, PAR 12.2%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0.0001 for all risk factors and p=0.03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.

Title: Eptinezumab Demonstrated Efficacy Regardless of Prior Preventive Migraine Treatment Failure Type: Post Hoc Analyses of the DELIVER Study.
Abstract: In the DELIVER study, eptinezumab reduced monthly migraine days (MMDs) more than placebo in patients with 2-4 prior preventive migraine treatment failures. This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of eptinezumab across the 24-week placebo-controlled period of the DELIVER study in subgroups defined by prior treatment failure type. DELIVER (NCT04418765) randomized adults with migraine to eptinezumab 100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo, administered intravenously every 12 weeks. Changes from baseline in MMDs and percentages of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MMDs (≥ 50% migraine responder rates [MRRs]) were summarized in subgroups of patients defined by prior treatment failure type. Subgroups were not mutually exclusive and included patients for whom topiramate, beta blockers (metoprolol, propranolol), amitriptyline, and/or flunarizine had failed. Across Weeks 1-12 in all subgroups, patients treated with eptinezumab experienced greater reductions from baseline in MMDs than those receiving placebo (reductions ranged from 4.5-5.5 vs 1.6-2.4, respectively), with larger reductions over Weeks 13-24. Similarly, ≥ 50% MRRs were consistently higher with eptinezumab than placebo and increased following a second infusion. In all subgroups, regardless of prior preventive treatment failure type, eptinezumab demonstrated greater reductions in MMDs and higher MRRs compared with placebo.

Title: Angiogenesis in cancer, vascular, rheumatoid and other disease.
Abstract: Recent discoveries of endogenous negative regulators of angiogenesis, thrombospondin, angiostatin and glioma-derived angiogenesis inhibitory factor, all associated with neovascularized tumours, suggest a new paradigm of tumorigenesis. It is now helpful to think of the switch to the angiogenic phenotype as a net balance of positive and negative regulators of blood vessel growth. The extent to which the negative regulators are decreased during this switch may dictate whether a primary tumour grows rapidly or slowly and whether metastases grow at all.

Title: Interaction of estradiol and renin-angiotensin system with microRNAs-21 and -29 in renal fibrosis: focus on TGF-β/smad signaling pathway.
Abstract: Kidney fibrosis is one of the complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD (and contributes to end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis and kidney transplantation. Several signaling pathways such as renin-angiotensin system (RAS), microRNAs (miRNAs) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad have a prominent role in pathophysiology and progression of renal fibrosis. Activation of classical RAS, the elevation of angiotensin II (Ang II) production and overexpression of AT1R, develop renal fibrosis via TGF-β/Smad pathway. While the non-classical RAS arm, Ang 1-7/AT2R, MasR reveals an anti-fibrotic effect via antagonizing Ang II. This review focused on studies illustrating the interaction of RAS with sexual female hormone estradiol and miRNAs in the progression of renal fibrosis with more emphasis on the TGF-β signaling pathway. MiRNAs, especially miRNA-21 and miRNA-29 showed regulatory effects in renal fibrosis. Also, 17β-estradiol (E2) is a renoprotective hormone that improved renal fibrosis. Beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are reported in the prevention of renal fibrosis in patients. Future studies are also merited to delineate the new therapy strategies such as miRNAs targeting, combination therapy of E2 or HRT, ACEis, and ARBs with miRNAs mimics and antagomirs in CKD to provide a new therapeutic approach for kidney patients.

Title: Effects of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, on cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.
Abstract: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors improve the outcome among patients with left ventricular dysfunction, whether or not they have heart failure. We assessed the role of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, in patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular events but who did not have left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. A total of 9297 high-risk patients (55 years of age or older) who had evidence of vascular disease or diabetes plus one other cardiovascular risk factor and who were not known to have a low ejection fraction or heart failure were randomly assigned to receive ramipril (10 mg once per day orally) or matching placebo for a mean of five years. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The trial was a two-by-two factorial study evaluating both ramipril and vitamin E. The effects of vitamin E are reported in a companion paper. A total of 651 patients who were assigned to receive ramipril (14.0 percent) reached the primary end point, as compared with 826 patients who were assigned to receive placebo (17.8 percent) (relative risk, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.86; P<0.001). Treatment with ramipril reduced the rates of death from cardiovascular causes (6.1 percent, as compared with 8.1 percent in the placebo group; relative risk, 0.74; P<0.001), myocardial infarction (9.9 percent vs. 12.3 percent; relative risk, 0.80; P<0.001), stroke (3.4 percent vs. 4.9 percent; relative risk, 0.68; P<0.001), death from any cause (10.4 percent vs. 12.2 percent; relative risk, 0.84; P=0.005), revascularization procedures (16.3 percent vs. 18.8 percent; relative risk, 0.85; P<0.001), cardiac arrest (0.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent; relative risk, 0.62; P=0.02), [corrected] heart failure (9.1 percent vs. 11.6 percent; relative risk, 0.77; P<0.001), and complications related to diabetes (6.4 percent vs. 7.6 percent; relative risk, 0.84; P=0.03). Ramipril significantly reduces the rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in a broad range of high-risk patients who are not known to have a low ejection fraction or heart failure.

Title: Lysophosphatidic acid contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by activating TRPV1 in spinal cord.
Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular diseases. Here, we question whether LPA contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by acting on transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in spinal cord. By ligating the left coronary artery to establish an in vivo I/R mouse model, we observed a 1.57-fold increase in LPA level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The I/R-elevated CSF LPA levels were reduced by HA130, an LPA synthesis inhibitor, compared to vehicle treatment (4.74 ± 0.34 vs. 6.46 ± 0.94 μg/mL, p = 0.0014). Myocardial infarct size was reduced by HA130 treatment compared to the vehicle group (26 ± 8% vs. 46 ± 8%, p = 0.0001). To block the interaction of LPA with TRPV1 at the K710 site, we generated a K710N knock-in mouse model. The TRPV1<sup>K710N</sup> mice were resistant to LPA-induced myocardial injury, showing a smaller infarct size relative to TRPV1<sup>WT</sup> mice (28 ± 4% vs. 60 ± 7%, p < 0.0001). Additionally, a sequence-specific TRPV1 peptide targeting the K710 region produced similar protective effects against LPA-induced myocardial injury. Blocking the K710 region through K710N mutation or TRPV1 peptide resulted in reduced neuropeptides release and decreased activity of cardiac sensory neurons, leading to a decrease in cardiac norepinephrine concentration and the restoration of intramyocardial pro-survival signaling, namely protein kinase B/extracellular regulated kinase/glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway. These findings suggest that the elevation of CSF LPA is strongly associated with myocardial I/R injury. Moreover, inhibiting the interaction of LPA with TRPV1 by blocking the K710 region uncovers a novel strategy for preventing myocardial ischemic injury.

Title: Apoptosis: a review of programmed cell death.
Abstract: The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.

Title: A novel model for predicting prognosis and response to immunotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.
Abstract: Blood-based biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) response in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are lacking, so it is necessary to identify biomarkers to select NPC patients who will benefit most or least from ICIs. The absolute values of lymphocyte subpopulations, biochemical indexes, and blood routine tests were determined before ICIs-based treatments in the training cohort (n = 130). Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) Cox regression analysis was developed to construct a prediction model. The performances of the prediction model were compared to TNM stage, treatment, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA using the concordance index (C-index). Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve. Other 63 patients were used for validation cohort. The novel model composed of histologic subtypes, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, regulatory T cells, red blood cells (RBC), AST/ALT ratio (SLR), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The C-index of this model was 0.784 in the training cohort and 0.735 in the validation cohort. K-M survival curve showed patients with high-risk scores had shorter PFS compared to the low-risk groups. For predicting immune therapy responses, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassifcation improvement index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI) of this model showed better predictive ability compared to EBV DNA. In this study, we constructed a novel model for prognostic prediction and immunotherapeutic response prediction in NPC patients, which may provide clinical assistance in selecting those patients who are likely to gain long-lasting clinical benefits to anti-PD-1 therapy.

Title: Prevention of coronary heart disease with pravastatin in men with hypercholesterolemia. West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study Group.
Abstract: Lowering the blood cholesterol level may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This double-blind study was designed to determine whether the administration of pravastatin to men with hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction reduced the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease. We randomly assigned 6595 men, 45 to 64 years of age, with a mean (+/- SD) plasma cholesterol level of 272 +/- 23 mg per deciliter (7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol per liter) to receive pravastatin (40 mg each evening) or placebo. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years. Medical records, electrocardiographic recordings, and the national death registry were used to determine the clinical end points. Pravastatin lowered plasma cholesterol levels by 20 percent and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 percent, whereas there was no change with placebo. There were 248 definite coronary events (specified as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease) in the placebo group, and 174 in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk with pravastatin, 31 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent; P < 0.001). There were similar reductions in the risk of definite nonfatal myocardial infarctions (31 percent reduction, P < 0.001), death from coronary heart disease (definite cases alone: 28 percent reduction, P = 0.13; definite plus suspected cases: 33 percent reduction, P = 0.042), and death from all cardiovascular causes (32 percent reduction, P = 0.033). There was no excess of deaths from noncardiovascular causes in the pravastatin group. We observed a 22 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause in the pravastatin group (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 40 percent; P = 0.051). Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction.

Title: Psilocybe cubensis extract potently prevents fear memory recall and freezing behavior in short- but not long-term in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder.
Abstract: Psilocybe cubensis is a species of psilocybin mushroom (magic mushroom) of moderate potency whose principal active compounds are psilocybin and psilocin. Recent studies have shown the significant procognitive and mood-enhancer effects of Psilocybe cubensis. However, evidence is so limited, especially in preclinical studies. We aimed to investigate the effect of Psilocybe cubensis extract on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like behavior, pain perception, locomotor activity, and anxiety in a rat model of PTSD. Male rats were exposed to three consecutive shocks (0.8 mA, 3 s interval) paired with three sounds broadcasted 3 s before delivering shocks (75 dB, 3 s). After 1, 3, or 21 days, freezing rate was measured in the fear-conditioning apparatus. Open filed test and hot plate were used to assess locomotor activity and anxiety, and pain subthreshold, respectively. Psilocybe cubensis was injected intraperitoneal at the dose of 25 mg/kg (single administration) before (pretrain) or after (posttrain) shocks, or before the test (pretest). Results showed psilocybin potently alleviated PTSD symptom is short- but not long-term after the induction of PTSD. Psilocybe cubensis decreased locomotor activity only in a short period after administration. Psilocybe cubensis also increased pain subthreshold and decreased anxiety. In conclusion, Psilocybe cubensis effects on PTSD-like behavior and locomotor activity seem to be remained in short-term, while Psilocybe cubensis effects on pain subthreshold and anxiety remained long-term. This is the first study evaluating the effect of Psilocybe cubensis on PTSD-like behavior in rats in three different time protocols (1, 3, and 21 days after fear conditioning).

Title: Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor underlying responsiveness of non-small-cell lung cancer to gefitinib.
Abstract: Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have no response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P<0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.

Title: Sotorasib Is a Pan-RASG12C Inhibitor Capable of Driving Clinical Response in NRASG12C Cancers.
Abstract: KRASG12C inhibitors, like sotorasib and adagrasib, potently and selectively inhibit KRASG12C through a covalent interaction with the mutant cysteine, driving clinical efficacy in KRASG12C tumors. Because amino acid sequences of the three main RAS isoforms-KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS-are highly similar, we hypothesized that some KRASG12C inhibitors might also target NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C, which are less common but critical oncogenic driver mutations in some tumors. Although some inhibitors, like adagrasib, were highly selective for KRASG12C, others also potently inhibited NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C. Notably, sotorasib was five-fold more potent against NRASG12C compared with KRASG12C or HRASG12C. Structural and reciprocal mutagenesis studies suggested that differences in isoform-specific binding are mediated by a single amino acid: Histidine-95 in KRAS (Leucine-95 in NRAS). A patient with NRASG12C colorectal cancer treated with sotorasib and the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab achieved a marked tumor response, demonstrating that sotorasib can be clinically effective in NRASG12C-mutated tumors. These studies demonstrate that certain KRASG12C inhibitors effectively target all RASG12C mutations and that sotorasib specifically is a potent NRASG12C inhibitor capable of driving clinical responses. These findings have important implications for the treatment of patients with NRASG12C or HRASG12C cancers and could guide design of NRAS or HRAS inhibitors.

Title: Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S).
Abstract: Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444 patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5.4 years median follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%) in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.85, p = 0.0003). The 6-year probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin groups were 87.6% and 91.3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths, respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.75, p < 0.00001), and the respective probabilities of escaping such events were 70.5% and 79.6%. This risk was also significantly reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p < 0.00001) in the risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures. This study shows that long-term treatment with simvastatin is safe and improves survival in CHD patients.

Title: Endocrine-Sensitive Disease Rate in Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Rich/ERBB2-Negative Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, or Their Combination: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.
Abstract: Adding fulvestrant to anastrozole (A+F) improved survival in postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer. However, the combination has not been tested in early-stage disease. To determine whether neoadjuvant fulvestrant or A+F increases the rate of pathologic complete response or ypT1-2N0/N1mic/Ki67 2.7% or less residual disease (referred to as endocrine-sensitive disease) over anastrozole alone. A phase 3 randomized clinical trial assessing differences in clinical and correlative outcomes between each of the fulvestrant-containing arms and the anastrozole arm. Postmenopausal women with clinical stage II to III, ER-rich (Allred score 6-8 or >66%)/ERBB2-negative breast cancer were included. All analyses were based on data frozen on March 2, 2023. Patients received anastrozole, fulvestrant, or a combination for 6 months preoperatively. Tumor Ki67 was assessed at week 4 and optionally at week 12, and if greater than 10% at either time point, the patient switched to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immediate surgery. The primary outcome was the endocrine-sensitive disease rate (ESDR). A secondary outcome was the percentage change in Ki67 after 4 weeks of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) (week 4 Ki67 suppression). Between February 2014 and November 2018, 1362 female patients (mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.2] years) were enrolled. Among the 1298 evaluable patients, ESDRs were 18.7% (95% CI, 15.1%-22.7%), 22.8% (95% CI, 18.9%-27.1%), and 20.5% (95% CI, 16.8%-24.6%) with anastrozole, fulvestrant, and A+F, respectively. Compared to anastrozole, neither fulvestrant-containing regimen significantly improved ESDR or week 4 Ki67 suppression. The rate of week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10% was 25.1%, 24.2%, and 15.7% with anastrozole, fulvestrant, and A+F, respectively. Pathologic complete response/residual cancer burden class I occurred in 8 of 167 patients and 17 of 167 patients, respectively (15.0%; 95% CI, 9.9%-21.3%), after switching to neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10%. PAM50 subtyping derived from RNA sequencing of baseline biopsies available for 753 patients (58%) identified 394 luminal A, 304 luminal B, and 55 nonluminal tumors. A+F led to a greater week 4 Ki67 suppression than anastrozole alone in luminal B tumors (median [IQR], -90.4% [-95.2 to -81.9%] vs -76.7% [-89.0 to -55.6%]; P < .001), but not luminal A tumors. Thirty-six nonluminal tumors (65.5%) had a week 4 or week 12 Ki67 greater than 10%. In this randomized clinical trial, neither fulvestrant nor A+F significantly improved the 6-month ESDR over anastrozole in ER-rich/ERBB2-negative breast cancer. Aromatase inhibition remains the standard-of-care NET. Differential NET response by PAM50 subtype in exploratory analyses warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01953588.

Title: Safety, activity, and immune correlates of anti-PD-1 antibody in cancer.
Abstract: Blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed by T cells, can overcome immune resistance. We assessed the antitumor activity and safety of BMS-936558, an antibody that specifically blocks PD-1. We enrolled patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer to receive anti-PD-1 antibody at a dose of 0.1 to 10.0 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks. Response was assessed after each 8-week treatment cycle. Patients received up to 12 cycles until disease progression or a complete response occurred. A total of 296 patients received treatment through February 24, 2012. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients; there were three deaths from pulmonary toxicity. No maximum tolerated dose was defined. Adverse events consistent with immune-related causes were observed. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. Cumulative response rates (all doses) were 18% among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (14 of 76 patients), 28% among patients with melanoma (26 of 94 patients), and 27% among patients with renal-cell cancer (9 of 33 patients). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or more in patients with 1 year or more of follow-up. To assess the role of intratumoral PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in the modulation of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on pretreatment tumor specimens obtained from 42 patients. Of 17 patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, none had an objective response; 9 of 25 patients (36%) with PD-L1-positive tumors had an objective response (P=0.006). Anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; the adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and objective response. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730639.).

Title: The Impact of Circulating Tumor Cell HOXB13 RNA Detection in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Treated with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.
Abstract: HOXB13 is an androgen receptor (AR) coregulator specifically expressed in cells of prostatic lineage. We sought to associate circulating tumor cell (CTC) HOXB13 expression with outcomes in men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the multicenter prospective PROPHECY trial of mCRPC men (NCT02269982, n = 118) treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. CTC detection and HOXB13 complementary DNA (cDNA) expression was measured using a modified Adnatest, grouping patients into 3 categories: CTC 0 (undetectable); CTC+ HOXB13 CTC low (<4 copies); or CTC+ HOXB13 CTC high. The HOXB13 threshold was determined by maximally selected rank statistics for prognostic associations with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We included 102 men with sufficient CTC HOXB13 cDNA, identifying 25%, 31%, and 44% of patients who were CTC 0, CTC+ HOXB13 low, and CTC+ HOXB13 high, respectively. Median OS were 25.7, 27.8, and 12.1 months whereas the median PFS were 9.0, 7.7, and 3.8 months, respectively. In subgroup analysis among men with CellSearch CTCs ≥5 copies/mL and adjusting for prior abi/enza treatment and Halabi clinical risk score, the multivariate HR for HOXB13 CTC detection was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.06-5.40) for OS and 2.78 (95% CI, 1.38-5.59) for PFS, respectively. Low HOXB13 CTC detection was associated with lower CTC PSA, PSMA, AR-FL, and AR-V7 detection, and more liver/lung metastases (41% vs. 25%). Higher CTC HOXB13 expression is associated with AR-dependent biomarkers in CTCs and is adversely prognostic in the context of potent AR inhibition in men with mCRPC.

Title: Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.
Abstract: The HER2 gene, which encodes the growth factor receptor HER2, is amplified and HER2 is overexpressed in 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers, increasing the aggressiveness of the tumor. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or with trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

Title: Phase II DORA Study of Olaparib with or without Durvalumab as a Chemotherapy-Free Maintenance Strategy in Platinum-Pretreated Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of PARP inhibition with or without programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade as chemotherapy-free maintenance therapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (aTNBC) sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the phase II non-comparative DORA trial (NCT03167619), patients with ongoing stable disease (SD) or complete/partial response (CR/PR) to first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy for TNBC (≤10% estrogen/progesterone receptor expression) were randomized 1:1 to receive olaparib 300 mg twice daily with or without durvalumab 1,500 mg on day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) versus a historical control of continued platinum-based therapy. 45 patients were randomized (23 to olaparib alone, 22 to the combination; 3 with estrogen/progesterone receptor expression 1%-10%). At 9.8 months' median follow-up, median PFS from randomization was 4.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-6.1] months with olaparib and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.7-10.1) months with the combination, both significantly longer than the historical control (P = 0.0023 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Clinical benefit rates (SD ≥24 weeks or CR/PR) were 44% (95% CI, 23%-66%) and 36% (95% CI, 17%-59%) in the monotherapy and combination arms, respectively. Sustained clinical benefit was seen irrespective of germline BRCA mutation or PD-L1 status, but tended to be associated with CR/PR to prior platinum, particularly in the olaparib-alone arm. No new safety signals were reported. PFS was longer than expected with both regimens. A patient subset with wild-type BRCA platinum-sensitive aTNBC had durable disease control with chemotherapy-free maintenance.

Title: EGFR mutations in lung cancer: correlation with clinical response to gefitinib therapy.
Abstract: Receptor tyrosine kinase genes were sequenced in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and matched normal tissue. Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR were found in 15of 58 unselected tumors from Japan and 1 of 61 from the United States. Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines. These results suggest that EGFR mutations may predict sensitivity to gefitinib.

Title: OX40 in the Pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis-A New Therapeutic Target.
Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, heterogeneous, inflammatory disease characterized by skin lesions, pruritus, and pain. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD experience chronic symptoms, intensified by unpredictable flares, and often have comorbidities and secondary complications, which can result in significant clinical burden that impacts the patient's overall quality of life. The complex interplay of immune dysregulation and skin barrier disruption drives AD pathogenesis, of which T-cell-dependent inflammation plays a critical role in patients with AD. Despite new targeted therapies, many patients with moderate-to-severe AD fail to achieve or sustain their individual treatment goals and/or may not be suitable for or tolerate these therapies. There remains a need for a novel, efficacious, well-tolerated therapeutic option that can deliver durable benefits across a heterogeneous AD patient population. Expression of OX40 [tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (TNFRSF4)], a prominent T-cell co-stimulatory molecule, and its ligand [OX40L; tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4)] is increased in AD. As the OX40 pathway is critical for expansion, differentiation, and survival of effector and memory T cells, its targeting might be a promising therapeutic approach to provide sustained inhibition of pathogenic T cells and associated inflammation and broad disease control. Antibodies against OX40 [rocatinlimab (AMG 451/KHK4083) and telazorlimab (GBR 830)] or OX40L [amlitelimab (KY1005)] have shown promising results in early-phase clinical studies of moderate-to-severe AD, highlighting the importance of OX40 signaling as a new therapeutic target in AD.

Title: The blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy.
Abstract: Among the most promising approaches to activating therapeutic antitumour immunity is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage. It is now clear that tumours co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance antitumour immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.

Title: Restraining of glycoprotein VI- and integrin α2β1-dependent thrombus formation by platelet PECAM1.
Abstract: The platelet receptors, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin α2β1 jointly control collagen-dependent thrombus formation via protein tyrosine kinases. It is unresolved to which extent the ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) receptor PECAM1 and its downstream acting protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 interfere in this process. Here, we hypothesized that integrin α2β1 has a co-regulatory role in the PECAM1- and PTPN11-dependent restraint of thrombus formation. We investigated platelet activation under flow on collagens with a different GPVI dependency and using integrin α2β1 blockage. Blood was obtained from healthy subjects and from patients with Noonan syndrome with a gain-of-function mutation of PTPN11 and variable bleeding phenotype. On collagens with decreasing GPVI activity (types I, III, IV), the surface-dependent inhibition of PECAM1 did not alter thrombus parameters using control blood. Blockage of α2β1 generally reduced thrombus parameters, most effectively on collagen IV. Strikingly, simultaneous inhibition of PECAM1 and α2β1 led to a restoration of thrombus formation, indicating that the suppressing signaling effect of PECAM1 is masked by the platelet-adhesive receptor α2β1. Blood from 4 out of 6 Noonan patients showed subnormal thrombus formation on collagen IV. In these patients, effects of α2β1 blockage were counterbalanced by PECAM1 inhibition to a normal phenotype. In summary, we conclude that the suppression of GPVI-dependent thrombus formation by either PECAM1 or a gain-of-function of PTPN11 can be overruled by α2β1 engagement.

Title: MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin in 20,536 high-risk individuals: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.
Abstract: Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.

Title: Lactate dehydrogenase A promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression through the TAK1/NF-κB Axis.
Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that originates in the nasopharyngeal mucosa and is common in China and Southeast Asian countries. Cancer cells reprogram glycolytic metabolism to promote their growth, survival and metastasis. Glycolysis plays an important role in NPC development, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a crucial glycolytic enzyme, catalyzing the last step of glycolysis. This study aims to investigate the exact role of LDHA, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, in NPC development. The western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) results indicated that LDHA was significantly upregulated in NPC cells and clinical samples. LDHA knockdown by shRNA significantly inhibited NPC cell proliferation and invasion. Further knockdown of LDHA dramatically weakened the tumorigenicity of NPC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that LDHA activated TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and subsequent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling to promote NPC cell proliferation and invasion. Exogenous lactate supplementation restored NPC cell proliferation and invasion inhibited by LDHA knockdown, and this restorative effect was reversed by NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082) or TAK1 inhibitor (5Z-7-oxozeaenol) treatment. Moreover, clinical sample analyses showed that LDHA expression was positively correlated with TAK1 Thr187 phosphorylation and poor prognosis. Our results suggest that LDHA and its major metabolite lactate drive NPC progression by regulating TAK1 and its downstream NF-κB signaling, which could become a therapeutic target in NPC.

Title: Gefitinib or carboplatin-paclitaxel in pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
Abstract: Previous, uncontrolled studies have suggested that first-line treatment with gefitinib would be efficacious in selected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. In this phase 3, open-label study, we randomly assigned previously untreated patients in East Asia who had advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma and who were nonsmokers or former light smokers to receive gefitinib (250 mg per day) (609 patients) or carboplatin (at a dose calculated to produce an area under the curve of 5 or 6 mg per milliliter per minute) plus paclitaxel (200 mg per square meter of body-surface area) (608 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival. The 12-month rates of progression-free survival were 24.9% with gefitinib and 6.7% with carboplatin-paclitaxel. The study met its primary objective of showing the noninferiority of gefitinib and also showed its superiority, as compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel, with respect to progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; P<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death with gefitinib, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05 to 3.98; P<0.001). The most common adverse events were rash or acne (in 66.2% of patients) and diarrhea (46.6%) in the gefitinib group and neurotoxic effects (69.9%), neutropenia (67.1%), and alopecia (58.4%) in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. Gefitinib is superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia. The presence in the tumor of a mutation of the EGFR gene is a strong predictor of a better outcome with gefitinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00322452.)

Title: TLR2 agonist prevents the progression of periapical lesions in mice by reducing osteoclast activity and regulating the frequency of Tregs.
Abstract: To evaluate the role of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in the presence or absence of the synthetic ligand Pam3Cys during the progression of periapical lesion in wild-type (WT) and toll-like receptor 2 knockout (TLR2KO) mice. A total of 130 C57BL/6 male WT and TLR2KO mice were allocated into control (n = 5) and experimental (periapical lesion induction) (n = 10) groups. In specific groups (WT+Pam3cys and TLR2KO+Pam3cys), the synthetic ligand Pam3cys was administered intraperitoneally every 7 days, according to the experimental period (14, 21 and 42 days). At the end of those periods, the animals were euthanized, and the mandible and the spleen were submitted to histotechnical processing. Mandible histological sections were analysed by haematoxylin and eosin, TRAP histoenzymology and immunohistochemistry (FOXP3, RANK, RANKL and OPG). Spleen sections were analysed by immunohistochemistry (FOXP3). The inflammatory infiltrate and bone resorption were more intense in the TLR2KO group compared to the WT group. The animals that received the Pam3cys had smaller periapical lesions when compared to the animals that did not receive the ligand (p < .05). TLR2KO animals showed a significant increase in the number of osteoclasts when compared to TLR2KO+Pam3cys group (p < .05). At 21 days, the WT+Pam3cys group had a lower number of osteoclasts when compared to the WT animals (p = .02). FOXP3 expression was more intense in the WT+Pam3cys groups when compared to the WT animals in the 42 days (p = .03). In the spleen analysis, the WT+Pam3cys group also had a higher expression of FOXP3 when compared to the WT animals at 14 and 42 days (p = .02). Concerning RANKL, there was a reduction in staining in the KOTLR2+Pam3cys groups at 21 and 42 days (p = .03) and a higher binding ratio between RANK/RANKL in animals that did not receive the ligand. Administration of the Pam3cys increased the proliferation of Tregs, showed by FOXP3 expression and prevented the progression of the periapical lesion in WT mice. On the other hand, in the TLR2KO animals, Treg expression was lower with larger areas of periapical lesions. Finally, systemic administration of the Pam3cys in KO animals was able to limit the deleterious effects of the absence of the TLR2 receptor.

Title: Nivolumab versus Docetaxel in Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
Abstract: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, disrupts PD-1-mediated signaling and may restore antitumor immunity. In this randomized, open-label, international phase 3 study, we assigned patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed during or after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy to receive nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks or docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. Overall survival was longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel. The median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.7 to 15.0) among 292 patients in the nivolumab group and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7) among 290 patients in the docetaxel group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P=0.002). At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) with nivolumab versus 39% (95% CI, 33 to 45) with docetaxel. With additional follow-up, the overall survival rate at 18 months was 39% (95% CI, 34 to 45) with nivolumab versus 23% (95% CI, 19 to 28) with docetaxel. The response rate was 19% with nivolumab versus 12% with docetaxel (P=0.02). Although progression-free survival did not favor nivolumab over docetaxel (median, 2.3 months and 4.2 months, respectively), the rate of progression-free survival at 1 year was higher with nivolumab than with docetaxel (19% and 8%, respectively). Nivolumab was associated with even greater efficacy than docetaxel across all end points in subgroups defined according to prespecified levels of tumor-membrane expression (≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥10%) of the PD-1 ligand. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 10% of the patients in the nivolumab group, as compared with 54% of those in the docetaxel group. Among patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC that had progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, overall survival was longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel.

Title: Lysophosphatidic acid contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by activating TRPV1 in spinal cord.
Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular diseases. Here, we question whether LPA contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by acting on transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in spinal cord. By ligating the left coronary artery to establish an in vivo I/R mouse model, we observed a 1.57-fold increase in LPA level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The I/R-elevated CSF LPA levels were reduced by HA130, an LPA synthesis inhibitor, compared to vehicle treatment (4.74 ± 0.34 vs. 6.46 ± 0.94 μg/mL, p = 0.0014). Myocardial infarct size was reduced by HA130 treatment compared to the vehicle group (26 ± 8% vs. 46 ± 8%, p = 0.0001). To block the interaction of LPA with TRPV1 at the K710 site, we generated a K710N knock-in mouse model. The TRPV1<sup>K710N</sup> mice were resistant to LPA-induced myocardial injury, showing a smaller infarct size relative to TRPV1<sup>WT</sup> mice (28 ± 4% vs. 60 ± 7%, p < 0.0001). Additionally, a sequence-specific TRPV1 peptide targeting the K710 region produced similar protective effects against LPA-induced myocardial injury. Blocking the K710 region through K710N mutation or TRPV1 peptide resulted in reduced neuropeptides release and decreased activity of cardiac sensory neurons, leading to a decrease in cardiac norepinephrine concentration and the restoration of intramyocardial pro-survival signaling, namely protein kinase B/extracellular regulated kinase/glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway. These findings suggest that the elevation of CSF LPA is strongly associated with myocardial I/R injury. Moreover, inhibiting the interaction of LPA with TRPV1 by blocking the K710 region uncovers a novel strategy for preventing myocardial ischemic injury.

Title: Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.
Abstract: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. We conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects. Vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.

Title: Ferrostatin-1 inhibits ferroptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells and alleviates abdominal aortic aneurysm formation through activating the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.
Abstract: Ferroptosis, a type of iron-catalyzed necrosis, is responsible for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) death and serves as a potential therapeutic target for alleviating aortic aneurysm. Here, our study explored the underlying mechanism of ferroptosis affecting VSMC functions and the resultant formation of AAA using its inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Microarray-based gene expression profiling was employed to identify differentially expressed genes related to AAA and ferroptosis. An AAA model was established by angiotensin II (Ang II) induction in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> ) mice, followed by injection of Fer-1 and RSL-3 (ferroptosis inducer). Then, the role of Fer-1 and RSL-3 in the ferroptosis of VSMCs and AAA formation was analyzed in Ang II-induced mice. Primary mouse VSMCs were cultured in vitro and treated with Ang II, Fer-1, sh-SLC7A11, or sh-GPX4 to assess the effect of Fer-1 via the SLC7A11/GPX axis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that GPX4 was involved in the fibrosis formation of AAA, and there was an interaction between SLC7A11 and GPX4. In vitro assays showed that Fer-1 alleviated Ang II-induced ferroptosis of VSMCs and retard the consequent AAA formation. The mechanism was associated with activation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway. Silencing of SLC7A11 or GPX4 could inhibit the ameliorating effect of Fer-1 on the ferroptosis of VSMCs. In vivo animal studies further demonstrated that Fer-1 inhibited Ang II-induced ferroptosis and vessel wall structural abnormalities in AAA mouse through activation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway. Fer-1 may prevent AAA formation through activation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway.

Title: Nivolumab versus Docetaxel in Advanced Squamous-Cell Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
Abstract: Patients with advanced squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy have limited treatment options. This randomized, open-label, international, phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, as compared with docetaxel in this patient population. We randomly assigned 272 patients to receive nivolumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks, or docetaxel, at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. The median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3 to 13.3) with nivolumab versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.3) with docetaxel. The risk of death was 41% lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.79; P<0.001). At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 42% (95% CI, 34 to 50) with nivolumab versus 24% (95% CI, 17 to 31) with docetaxel. The response rate was 20% with nivolumab versus 9% with docetaxel (P=0.008). The median progression-free survival was 3.5 months with nivolumab versus 2.8 months with docetaxel (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.81; P<0.001). The expression of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 7% of the patients in the nivolumab group as compared with 55% of those in the docetaxel group. Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level.

Title: CYP2D6 Genotyping and Inhibition as Predictors of Adverse Drug Reactions in Depressive Disorders.
Abstract: <b><i>Objective:</i></b> The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between the different predicted phenotypes of the polymorphic <i>CYP2D6</i> gene and the prevalence of adverse drug reactions in patients suffering from depressive disorders. The secondary aim was to investigate if comedication with CYP2D6 inhibitors resulted in more adverse drug reactions due to phenoconversion. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Between January 2012 and December 2021, 415 patients with a depressive disorder and insufficient treatment response in secondary psychiatric care were included in the naturalistic observational study Genes, Depression, and Suicidality (GEN-DS). The patients were subjected to a semistructured interview and diagnosed according to <i>DSM-IV</i>. Patients were also required to complete the self-rating version of the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale. All patients were genotyped for <i>CYP2D6</i> and assigned a corresponding predicted CYP2D6 phenotype. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Out of the 415 patients, 147 patients with available genotyping and UKU scale results were also prescribed 1 or more drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. We did not find any evidence of an effect of the predicted CYP2D6 phenotype on the total burden of adverse drug reactions or in any of the specific symptom domains as measured with the UKU scale among these patients. We also investigated if comedication with 1 or more substances that inhibited the effect of the CYP2D6 enzyme resulted in more reported adverse drug reactions due to phenoconversion. Even though the rate of phenotypic PMs increased from 13 to 38 patients, we did not find any support for increased adverse drug reactions in this group. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> We did not find that CYP2D6 phenotype could predict the occurrence of adverse drug reactions in patients with depressive disorders in this naturalistic setting. However, information about <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype may still be important in antidepressant treatment for the selection of appropriate drugs, for dosing recommendations of certain medications, or when the patient is suffering from severe adverse reactions.

Title: Safety and activity of anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with advanced cancer.
Abstract: Programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein, a T-cell coinhibitory receptor, and one of its ligands, PD-L1, play a pivotal role in the ability of tumor cells to evade the host's immune system. Blockade of interactions between PD-1 and PD-L1 enhances immune function in vitro and mediates antitumor activity in preclinical models. In this multicenter phase 1 trial, we administered intravenous anti-PD-L1 antibody (at escalating doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) to patients with selected advanced cancers. Anti-PD-L1 antibody was administered every 14 days in 6-week cycles for up to 16 cycles or until the patient had a complete response or confirmed disease progression. As of February 24, 2012, a total of 207 patients--75 with non-small-cell lung cancer, 55 with melanoma, 18 with colorectal cancer, 17 with renal-cell cancer, 17 with ovarian cancer, 14 with pancreatic cancer, 7 with gastric cancer, and 4 with breast cancer--had received anti-PD-L1 antibody. The median duration of therapy was 12 weeks (range, 2 to 111). Grade 3 or 4 toxic effects that investigators considered to be related to treatment occurred in 9% of patients. Among patients with a response that could be evaluated, an objective response (a complete or partial response) was observed in 9 of 52 patients with melanoma, 2 of 17 with renal-cell cancer, 5 of 49 with non-small-cell lung cancer, and 1 of 17 with ovarian cancer. Responses lasted for 1 year or more in 8 of 16 patients with at least 1 year of follow-up. Antibody-mediated blockade of PD-L1 induced durable tumor regression (objective response rate of 6 to 17%) and prolonged stabilization of disease (rates of 12 to 41% at 24 weeks) in patients with advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal-cell cancer.

Title: Long-term effectiveness and tolerability of ketogenic diet therapy in patients with genetic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy onset within the first 6 months of life.
Abstract: To investigate the effectiveness and tolerability of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) associated with genetic etiology which onset within the first 6 months of life, and to explore the association between response to KDT and genotype/clinical parameters. We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with genetic DEE who started KDT at Beijing Children's Hospital between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021. A total of 32 patients were included, involving 14 pathogenic or likely pathogenic single genes, and 16 (50.0%) patients had sodium/potassium channel gene variants. The median age at onset of epilepsy was 1.0 (IQR: 0.1, 3.0) months. The median age at initiation of KDT was 10.0 (IQR: 5.3, 13.8) months and the median duration of maintenance was 14.0 (IQR: 7.0, 26.5) months, with a mean blood β-hydroxybutyrate of 2.49 ± 0.62 mmol/L. During the maintenance period of KDT, 26 (81.3%) patients had a ≥50% reduction of seizure frequency, of which 12 (37.5%) patients achieved seizure freedom. Better responses were observed in patients with STXBP1 variants, with four out of five patients achieving seizure freedom. There were no statistically differences in the age of onset, duration of epilepsy before KDT, blood ketone values, or the presence of ion channel gene variants between the seizure-free patients and the others. The most common adverse effects were gastrointestinal side effects, which occurred in 21 patients (65.6%), but all were mild and easily corrected. Only one patient discontinued KDT due to nephrolithiasis. KDT is effective in treating early onset genetic DEE, and no statistically significant relationship has been found between genotype and effectiveness in this study. KDT is well tolerated in most young patients, with mild and reversible gastrointestinal side effects being the most common, but usually not the reason to discontinue KDT. This study evaluated the response and side effects of ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) in patients who had seizures within the first 6 months of life, and were diagnosed with genetic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a type of severe epilepsy with developmental delay caused by gene variants. Thirty-two patients involving 14 gene variants who started KDT at Beijing Children's Hospital between were included. KDT was effective in treating early onset genetic DEE in this cohort, and patients with STXBP1 variants responded better; however, no statistically significant relationship was found between gene variant and response. Most young patients tolerated KDT well, with mild and reversible gastrointestinal side effects being the most common.

Title: Opposing effects of ERK and JNK-p38 MAP kinases on apoptosis.
Abstract: Apoptosis plays an important role during neuronal development, and defects in apoptosis may underlie various neurodegenerative disorders. To characterize molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis, the contributions to cell death of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members, including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase), and p38, were examined after withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) from rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. NGF withdrawal led to sustained activation of the JNK and p38 enzymes and inhibition of ERKs. The effects of dominant-interfering or constitutively activated forms of various components of the JNK-p38 and ERK signaling pathways demonstrated that activation of JNK and p38 and concurrent inhibition of ERK are critical for induction of apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, the dynamic balance between growth factor-activated ERK and stress-activated JNK-p38 pathways may be important in determining whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.

Title: TNFSF14 mediates the impact of docosahexaenoic acid on atopic dermatitis: a Mendelian randomization study.
Abstract: While current research suggests potential value for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the prevention and management of atopic dermatitis (AD), the causal relationship between DHA and AD remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To investigate the potential causal relationship between DHA and AD, as well as to explore potential mediating mechanisms, we employed the Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. To study these potential relationships, we conducted MR analysis using publicly available Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data. Effect estimates were computed using the random-effects inverse-variance weighted method. Our study demonstrates a negative correlation between DHA levels and AD risk (OR: 0.915, 95% CI: 0.858-0.975, p=0.007). Furthermore, in MR analysis using tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) levels as an outcome, DHA levels also show a negative association with TNFSF14 levels (OR: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.879-0.990, p=0.022). Subsequently, we performed further analysis to explore the relationship between TNFSF14 and AD risk, revealing a positive correlation (OR: 1.069, 95% CI: 1.005-1.137, p=0.033). This suggests a potential mediating role of TNFSF14 in the impact of DHA on AD risk. In summary, our study employs MR analysis to offer genetic evidence indicating a potential role of DHA in reducing the risk of AD, as well as opening avenues for further in-depth investigation into potential mechanisms. These findings emphasize the importance of ongoing research in this field.

Title: PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency.
Abstract: Somatic mutations have the potential to encode ""non-self"" immunogenic antigens. We hypothesized that tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate. The immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]). Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67% [4 of 6 patients]). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02). This study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.

Title: Pembrolizumab versus Chemotherapy for PD-L1-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
Abstract: Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1) that has antitumor activity in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with increased activity in tumors that express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 305 patients who had previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and no sensitizing mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene to receive either pembrolizumab (at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks) or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy. Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety. Median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P=0.005). The response rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months] vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%). In patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.
