                "**Score:** **+1 Point**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe hypothesis posits that PP2 treats Alzheimer's disease through its effect on FYN. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will analyze the provided abstracts to understand the interactions between Alzheimer's disease (AD), the Src family kinase FYN, and the kinase inhibitor PP2. We will assess the nature and directionality of these interactions and determine whether they support or contradict the hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Interactions:**\n\n**1. Interactions between Alzheimer's Disease and FYN:**\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 9600986**\n\n  - **Evidence:** The abstract reports that the **germ-line knockout of Fyn**, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, **was neuroprotective** against neurotoxicity induced by Abeta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) in CNS cultures.\n  \n  - **Interpretation:** **Inhibition of FYN activity is beneficial** in the context of AD, as it reduces neurotoxicity.\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 20655099**\n\n  - **Evidence:** The study shows that **missorting of tau** or absence of tau, which disrupts postsynaptic targeting of Fyn, mitigates Abeta toxicity. This uncouples NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.\n\n  - **Interpretation:** **Reducing FYN's postsynaptic presence** decreases Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that **FYN contributes to AD pathology**, and its inhibition is beneficial.\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 35253743**\n\n  - **Evidence:** Bioinformatics analysis identified FYN as one of the top kinase nodes impacting APP and tau, strengthening the molecular link between Alzheimer's disease and insulin signaling.\n\n  - **Interpretation:** FYN plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis by influencing key proteins involved in the disease.\n\n**Conclusion on AD-FYN Interaction:**\n\n- The evidence consistently indicates that **FYN contributes to the neurotoxic processes in AD**, and **inhibition of FYN activity is beneficial** in reducing neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n---\n\n**2. Interactions between FYN and PP2:**\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 36532777**\n\n  - **Evidence:** The study demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition of FYN using **PP2 significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1-induced pro-inflammatory activation** in endothelial cells.\n\n  - **Interpretation:** **PP2 acts as an inhibitor of FYN**, effectively reducing FYN-mediated signaling events.\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 11278378**\n\n  - **Evidence:** Nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Abeta toxicity was **suppressed by the Src inhibitor PP2**. The protective pathway involves the alpha7 nicotinic receptor signaling through PI3K and Src kinase.\n\n  - **Interpretation:** **Inhibition of Src family kinases (including FYN) by PP2 can block neuroprotective pathways**, suggesting a potential detrimental effect.\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 35820485**\n\n  - **Evidence:** FYN phosphorylates PP2A, affecting Tau phosphorylation\u2014a key process in AD pathology. Dysregulation of FYN leads to altered PP2A activity, contributing to AD.\n\n  - **Interpretation:** **Inhibition of FYN could prevent abnormal phosphorylation of Tau** by stabilizing PP2A activity.\n\n**Conclusion on FYN-PP2 Interaction:**\n\n- **PP2 functions as an inhibitor of FYN.** Evidence shows that PP2-mediated inhibition of FYN can **reduce pro-inflammatory signaling** and potentially prevent pathological phosphorylation events implicated in AD.\n  \n- However, **in one context**, PP2 inhibition of Src kinases (including FYN) **blocked a neuroprotective pathway** mediated by the alpha7 nicotinic receptor.\n\n---\n\n**3. Synthesizing the Findings:**\n\n- **Supporting Evidence:**\n\n  - **Inhibition of FYN by PP2 is beneficial** in reducing pro-inflammatory signaling (PMID: 36532777) and potentially in preventing abnormal Tau phosphorylation (PMID: 35820485).\n  \n  - **Reduction of FYN activity** correlates with decreased neurotoxicity and mitigated Abeta toxicity in AD models (PMIDs: 9600986, 20655099).\n\n- **Contradictory Evidence:**\n\n  - **PP2 inhibition of Src kinases can block neuroprotective pathways**, as seen with nicotine-induced protection against Abeta toxicity (PMID: 11278378). This suggests that **inhibition of FYN may sometimes be detrimental** by impeding beneficial signaling pathways.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment of the Hypothesis:**\n\n- **Alignment with Hypothesis:**\n\n  - The majority of the evidence supports the hypothesis that **PP2 treats Alzheimer's disease through its inhibitory effect on FYN**, leading to reduced neurotoxicity and mitigation of AD pathological processes.\n\n- **Contradictions:**\n\n  - There is conflicting evidence where **inhibition of FYN by PP2 blocks neuroprotective effects**, indicating that the role of FYN is complex, and inhibition may not always be beneficial.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided abstracts:\n\n- **There is supportive evidence** that **inhibition of FYN by PP2** can have therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease by reducing neurotoxicity and pathological phosphorylation events.\n\n- **However, there is also evidence** suggesting that **inhibition of FYN may block neuroprotective pathways**, which could be detrimental.\n\n- **Overall**, the hypothesis is **likely supported** by the evidence, but **some uncertainty and contradictory findings exist**.\n\n---\n\n**Justification for Score:**\n\nAccording to the scoring guidelines:\n\n- **+1:** The hypothesis is **likely supported** by the provided texts. The evidence suggests that the interactions between Alzheimer's-FYN and FYN-PP2 may **align with** the proposed outcome, but **some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists**.\n\nGiven the balance of evidence\u2014with supportive findings and some contradictory data\u2014the appropriate score is **+1**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n**Score:** **+1 Point**\n\nThis score reflects that the hypothesis is **likely supported** by the evidence, but the presence of contradictory findings prevents a full confirmation. Further research would be necessary to resolve these contradictions and fully validate the hypothesis."

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 9600986\nTitle: Diffusible, nonfibrillar ligands derived from Abeta1-42 are potent central nervous system neurotoxins.\nAbstract: Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 20655099\nTitle: Dendritic function of tau mediates amyloid-beta toxicity in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.\nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. It has emerged that Abeta toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Deltatau) and absence of tau in tau(-/-) mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Abeta toxicity. Deltatau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Abeta-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Abeta toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 35820485\nTitle: A new paradigm for regulation of protein phosphatase 2A function via Src and Fyn kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.\nAbstract: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatase and a key regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways. While PP2A dysfunction has been linked to human cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), PP2A regulation remains relatively poorly understood. It has been reported that the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) is inactivated by a single phosphorylation at the Tyr307 residue by tyrosine kinases such as v-Src. However, multiple mass spectrometry studies have revealed the existence of other putative PP2Ac phosphorylation sites in response to activation of Src and Fyn, two major Src family kinases (SFKs). Here, using PP2Ac phosphomutants and novel phosphosite-specific PP2Ac antibodies, we show that cellular pools of PP2Ac are instead phosphorylated on both Tyr127 and Tyr284 upon Src activation, and on Tyr284 following Fyn activation. We found these phosphorylation events enhanced the interaction of PP2Ac with SFKs. In addition, we reveal SFK-mediated phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Y284 promotes dissociation of the regulatory B\u03b1 subunit, altering PP2A substrate specificity; the phosphodeficient Y127/284F and Y284F PP2Ac mutants prevented SFK-mediated phosphorylation of Tau at the CP13 (pSer202) epitope, a pathological hallmark of AD, and SFK-dependent activation of ERK, a major growth regulatory kinase upregulated in many cancers. Our findings demonstrate a novel PP2A regulatory mechanism that challenges the existing dogma on the inhibition of PP2A catalytic activity by Tyr307 phosphorylation. We propose dysregulation of SFK signaling in cancer and AD can lead to alterations in PP2A phosphorylation and subsequent deregulation of key PP2A substrates, including ERK and Tau.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36639708\nTitle: Tyrosine phosphatase STEP<sub>61</sub> in human dementia and in animal models with amyloid and tau pathology.\nAbstract: Synaptic degeneration is a precursor of synaptic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology (FTD-tau), a group of primary tauopathies. A critical role in this degenerative process is assumed by enzymes such as the kinase Fyn and its counterpart, the phosphatase striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP<sub>61</sub>). Whereas the role of Fyn has been widely explored, less is known about STEP<sub>61</sub> that localises to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic neurons. In dementias, synaptic loss is associated with an increased burden of pathological aggregates. Tau pathology is a hallmark of both AD (together with amyloid-\u03b2 deposition) and FTD-tau. Here, we examined STEP<sub>61</sub> and its activity in human and animal brain tissue and observed a correlation between STEP<sub>61</sub> and disease progression. In early-stage human AD, an initial increase in the level and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> was observed, which decreased with the loss of the synaptic marker PSD-95; in FTD-tau, there was a reduction in STEP<sub>61</sub> and PSD-95 which correlated with clinical diagnosis. In APP23 mice with an amyloid-\u03b2 pathology, the level and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> were increased in the synaptic fraction compared to wild-type littermates. Similarly, in the K3 mouse model of FTD-tau, which we assessed at two ages compared to wild-type, expression and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> were increased with ageing. Together, these findings suggest that STEP contributes differently to the pathogenic process in AD and FTD-tau, and that its activation may be an early response to a degenerative process.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 35253743\nTitle: A Bioinformatics Approach Toward Unravelling the Synaptic Molecular Crosstalk Between Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes.\nAbstract: Increasing evidence links impaired brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence prompted a search for molecular players common to AD and diabetes mellitus (DM). The work incorporated studies based on a primary care-based cohort (pcb-Cohort) and a bioinformatics analysis to identify central nodes, that are key players in AD and insulin signaling (IS) pathways. The interactome for each of these key proteins was retrieved and network maps were developed for AD and IS. Synaptic enrichment was performed to reveal synaptic common hubs. Cohort analysis showed that individuals with DM exhibited a correlation with poor performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test. Additionally, APOE \u025b2 allele carriers appear to potentially be relatively more protected against both DM and cognitive deficits. Ten clusters were identified in this network and 32 key synaptic proteins were common to AD and IS. Given the relevance of signaling pathways, another network was constructed focusing on protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and the top 6 kinase nodes (LRRK2, GSK3B, AKT1, EGFR, MAPK1, and FYN) were further analyzed. This allowed the elaboration of signaling cascades directly impacting A\u03b2PP and tau, whereby distinct signaling pathway play a major role and strengthen an AD-IS link at a molecular level.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 11278378\nTitle: alpha 7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to block A beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity.\nAbstract: Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 11788577\nTitle: Src is the kinase of the Helicobacter pylori CagA protein in vitro and in vivo.\nAbstract: The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system to inject the bacterial CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells. Within the host cell, CagA becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and initiates cytoskeletal rearrangements. We demonstrate here that Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases mediate CagA phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. First, the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 specifically blocks CagA phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangements thereby inhibiting the CagA-induced hummingbird phenotype of gastric epithelial cells. Second, CagA is in vivo phosphorylated by transiently expressed c-Src. Third, recombinant c-Src and lysates derived from c-Src-expressing fibroblasts but not lysates derived from Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells phosphorylated CagA in vitro. Fourth, a transfected CagA-GFP fusion protein is phosphorylated in vivo in Src-positive fibroblasts but not in Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells. Because a CagA-GFP fusion protein mutated in an EPIYA motif is not efficiently phosphorylated in any of these fibroblast cells, the CagA EPIYA motif appears to constitute the major c-Src phosphorylation site conserved among CagA-positive Helicobacter strains.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36532777\nTitle: Pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases axl and fyn reduces TNF-\u03b1-induced endothelial inflammatory activation <i>in vitro</i>.\nAbstract: Major surgery induces systemic inflammation leading to pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Endothelial inflammation is one of the drivers of postoperative organ damage, including acute kidney injury Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is an important component of surgery-induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Kinases, the backbone of signalling cascades, can be targeted by pharmacological inhibition. This is a promising treatment option to interfere with excessive endothelial inflammation. In this study, we identified activated kinases as potential therapeutic targets. These targets were pharmacologically inhibited to reduce TNF-\u03b1-induced pro-inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells. Kinome profiling using PamChip arrays identified 64 protein tyrosine kinases and 88 serine-threonine kinases, the activity of which was determined at various timepoints (5-240\u00a0min) following stimulation with 10\u00a0ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. The PTKs Axl and Fyn were selected based on high kinase activity profiles. Co-localisation experiments with the endothelial-specific protein CD31 showed Axl expression in endothelial cells of glomeruli and Fyn in arterioles and glomeruli of both control and TNF-\u03b1-exposed mice. Pharmacological inhibition with Axl inhibitor BMS-777607 and Fyn inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1-induced pro-inflammatory activation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 at mRNA and VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 at protein level in HUVEC <i>in vitro</i>. Upon pharmacological inhibition with each inhibitor, leukocyte adhesion to HUVEC was also significantly reduced, however to a minor extent. In conclusion, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with kinase inhibitors BMS-777607 and PP2 reduces TNF-\u03b1-induced endothelial inflammation <i>in vitro</i>.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 34238111\nTitle: Identification of imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2-one derivatives as novel Src family kinase inhibitors against glioblastoma.\nAbstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumour in the central nervous system (CNS). As the ideal targets for GBM treatment, Src family kinases (SFKs) have attracted much attention. Herein, a new series of imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2-one derivatives were designed and synthesised as SFK inhibitors. Compounds <b>1d</b>, <b>1e</b>, <b>1q</b>, <b>1s</b> exhibited potential Src and Fyn kinase inhibition in the submicromolar range, of which were next tested for their antiproliferative potency on four GBM cell lines. Compound <b>1s</b> showed effective activity against U87, U251, T98G, and U87-EGFRvIII GBM cell lines, comparable to that of lead compound PP2. Molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation revealed the possible binding patterns of the most active compound <b>1s</b> in ATP binding site of SFKs. ADME prediction suggested that <b>1s</b> accord with the criteria of CNS drugs. These results led us to identify a novel SFK inhibitor as candidate for GBM treatment.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 35185557\nTitle: The Src-Kinase Fyn is Required for Cocaine-Associated Memory Through Regulation of Tau.\nAbstract: Drug-associated context-induced relapse of cocaine-seeking behaviour requires the retrieval of drug-associated memory. Studies exploring the underlying neurobiological mechanism of drug memory formation will likely contribute to the development of treatments for drug addiction and the prevention of relapse. In our study, we applied a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and a self-administration paradigm (two drug-associated memory formation model) to confirm the hypothesis that the Src kinase Fyn critically regulates cocaine-associated memory formation in the hippocampus. For this experiment, we administered the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 into the bilateral hippocampus before cocaine-CPP and self-administration training, and the results showed that pharmacological manipulation of the Src kinase Fyn activity significantly attenuated the response to cocaine-paired cues in the cocaine-CPP and self-administration paradigms, indicating that hippocampal Fyn activity contributes to cocaine-associated memory formation. In addition, the regulation of cocaine-associated memory formation by Fyn depends on Tau expression, as restoring Tau to normal levels disrupted cocaine memory formation. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal Fyn activity plays a key role in the formation of cocaine-associated memory, which underlies cocaine-associated contextual stimulus-mediated regulation of cocaine-seeking behaviour, suggesting that Fyn represents a promising therapeutic target for weakening cocaine-related memory and treating cocaine addiction.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between Alzheimer\u2019s and PP2 through their own interactions with FYN.

                "Score: 0 Points - Reasoning:\n\nAfter analyzing the provided abstracts, the evidence regarding the hypothesis \"PP2 treats Alzheimer\u2019s\" is mixed and inconclusive, showing both potential beneficial and detrimental effects of PP2 in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\n**Abstract 1 (PMID: 11278378):**\n\nThis study demonstrates that PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor, suppresses nicotine-induced neuroprotection against beta-amyloid (A\u03b2)-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine activates the alpha7 nicotinic receptor, leading to PI3K/Akt signaling and neuroprotection. PP2 inhibits Src kinases necessary for this protective pathway, thereby reducing the neuroprotective effect. This suggests that PP2 may **inhibit beneficial pathways** in AD, potentially worsening neurotoxicity. Therefore, PP2 appears to have a **detrimental effect** in the context of AD in this study.\n\n**Abstract 2 (PMID: 11756483):**\n\nHere, exposure to A\u03b2 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of neuronal proteins, including tau, contributing to neurodegenerative changes. PP2 blocks this A\u03b2-induced phosphorylation by inhibiting Src family tyrosine kinases, suggesting that PP2 may **prevent harmful processes** initiated by A\u03b2. This implies a **beneficial effect** of PP2 in reducing A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity in AD.\n\n**Abstract 3 (PMID: 30735733):**\n\nThe study investigates Panaxadiol's ability to alleviate synaptic dysfunction in AD by inhibiting Fyn kinase activity. PP2 is used to block the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKII\u03b1 signaling pathway implicated in synaptic damage. The results show that PP2 reduces the expression of proteins related to this harmful pathway. This indicates that PP2 may **decrease synaptic damage** by inhibiting detrimental signaling, suggesting a **beneficial effect** of PP2 in treating AD.\n\n**Abstract 4 (PMID: 33536910):**\n\nThis study shows that A\u03b2 oligomers hyperactivate Ras, leading to downregulation of Src kinase activity, which impedes NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and causes cognitive deficits. Administration of PP2 further **impairs spatial cognition and LTP induction** in both control mice and A\u03b2-treated mice by inhibiting Src kinase activity. This suggests that PP2 **exacerbates synaptic and cognitive deficits**, indicating a **detrimental effect** in the context of AD.\n\n**Abstract 5 (PMID: 34818135):**\n\nThe study finds that A\u03b225-35 oligomers induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 via activation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SrcPTKs), contributing to neurotoxicity. PP2 attenuates this phosphorylation, suggesting that PP2 may **inhibit harmful processes** induced by A\u03b2 oligomers. This points to a **beneficial effect** of PP2 in reducing A\u03b2-induced synaptic dysfunction in AD.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe abstracts present conflicting evidence regarding the role of PP2 in AD:\n\n- **Beneficial Effects:** In Abstracts 2, 3, and 5, PP2 inhibits harmful pathways activated by A\u03b2, potentially reducing neurotoxicity and synaptic damage. This suggests that PP2 might be beneficial in treating AD by blocking detrimental processes.\n\n- **Detrimental Effects:** In Abstracts 1 and 4, PP2 inhibits neuroprotective pathways or normal synaptic function, leading to reduced neuroprotection and impaired cognition. This indicates that PP2 might worsen AD symptoms by inhibiting beneficial signaling pathways.\n\nThe **evidence is mixed**\u2014some studies suggest that PP2 has a neuroprotective role by inhibiting harmful effects of A\u03b2, while others show that it can impair neuroprotective mechanisms and cognitive function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the contradictory findings, the evidence neither consistently supports nor refutes the hypothesis that \"PP2 treats Alzheimer\u2019s.\" The interactions between PP2 and AD are complex, involving both inhibitory effects on harmful pathways and unintended inhibition of beneficial pathways. Therefore, the current evidence is **inconclusive** regarding the therapeutic potential of PP2 in AD.\n\n**Assigned Score:** **0 Points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAccording to the scoring guidelines:\n\n- **0:** *The hypothesis is neither supported nor refuted by the provided texts. The evidence regarding the interaction between Alzheimer\u2019s and PP2 is inconclusive, mixed, lacks sufficient detail, or there is a lack of evidence.*\n\nThe mixed and contradictory nature of the evidence fits this criterion. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate, as the hypothesis cannot be definitively supported or refuted based on the provided abstracts."

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 11278378\nTitle: alpha 7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to block A beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity.\nAbstract: Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 11756483\nTitle: Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of neuronal proteins including tau and focal adhesion kinase in response to amyloid-beta peptide exposure: involvement of Src family protein kinases.\nAbstract: The increased production of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease is acknowledged to be a key pathogenic event. In this study, we examined the response of primary human and rat brain cortical cultures to Abeta administration and found a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation content of numerous neuronal proteins, including tau and putative microtubule-associated protein 2c (MAP2c). We also found that paired helical filaments of aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau are tyrosine phosphorylated, indicating that changes in the phosphotyrosine content of cytoplasmic proteins in response to Abeta are potentially an important process. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and other neuronal proteins was specific to fibrillar Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(1-42). The tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by addition of the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7(t-butyl)pyrazol(3,4-d)pyramide (PP2) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Tyrosine phosphorylation of tau and MAP2c was concomitant with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent putative activation of the non-receptor kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Immunoprecipitation of Fyn, a member of the Src family, from Abeta(25-35)-treated neurons showed an increased association of Fyn with FAK. Abeta treatment of cells also stimulated the sustained activation of extracellular regulated kinase-2, which was blocked by addition of PP2 and LY 294002, suggesting that FAK/Fyn/PI3-kinase association is upstream of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in Abeta-treated neurons. This cascade of signaling events contains the earliest biochemical changes in neurons to be described in response to Abeta exposure and may be critical for subsequent neurodegenerative changes.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30735733\nTitle: Panaxadiol inhibits synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and targets the Fyn protein in APP/PS1 mice and APP-SH-SY5Y cells.\nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by memory loss and synaptic damage. Up to now, there are limited drugs to cure or delay the state of this illness. Recently, the Fyn tyrosine kinase is implicated in AD pathology triggered by synaptic damage. Thus, Fyn inhibition may prevent or delay the AD progression. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated whether Panaxadiol could decrease synaptic damage in AD and the underlying mechanism. The ability of learning and memory of mice has detected by Morris Water Maze. The pathological changes detected by H&E staining and Nissl staining. The percentage of cell apoptosis and the calcium concentration were detected by Flow Cytometry in vitro. The amount of synaptic protein and related proteins in the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKII\u03b1 signaling pathway were detected by Western Blot. In the present article, Panaxadiol could significantly improve the ability of learning and memory of mice and reduce its synaptic dysfunction. Panaxadiol could down-regulate GluN2B's phosphorylation level by inhibition Fyn kinase activity, Subsequently, decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated synaptic damage, reducing LDH leakage, inhibiting apoptosis in AD, resulting in facilitating the cells survival. For the underlying molecular mechanism, we used PP2 to block the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKII\u03b1 signaling pathway. The results from WB showed that the expression of related proteins in the Fyn signaling pathway decreased with PP2 treated. Our results indicate that Panaxadiol could decrease synaptic damage, which will cause AD via inhibition of the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKII\u03b1 signaling pathway. Thus, the Panaxadiol is a best promising candidate to test as a potential therapy for AD.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33536910\nTitle: Oligomer \u03b2-amyloid Induces Hyperactivation of Ras to Impede NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal CA1 of Mice.\nAbstract: The activity of Ras, a small GTPase protein, is increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oligomeric A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> on the activation of Ras, and the involvement of the Ras hyperactivity in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced deficits in spatial cognition and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> in mice (A\u03b2-mice) enhanced hippocampal Ras activation and expression, while 60\u00a0min incubation of hippocampal slices in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> (A\u03b2-slices) only elevated Ras activity. A\u03b2-mice showed deficits in spatial cognition and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, but basal synaptic transmission was enhanced. The above effects of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> were corrected by the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS). ERK2 phosphorylation increased, and Src phosphorylation decreased in A\u03b2-mice and A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-slices. Both were corrected by FTS. In CA1 pyramidal cells of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, the response of AMPA receptor and phosphorylation of GluR1 were enhanced with dependence on Ras activation rather than ERK signaling. In contrast, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function and GluN2A/2B phosphorylation were downregulated in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, which was recovered by application of FTS or the Src activator ouabain, and mimicked in control slices treated with the Src inhibitor PP2. The administration of PP2 impaired the spatial cognition and LTP induction in control mice and FTS-treated A\u03b2-mice. The treatment of A\u03b2-mice with ouabain rescued A\u03b2-impaired spatial cognition and LTP. Overall, the results indicate that the oligomeric A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> hyperactivates Ras and thereby causes the downregulation of Src which impedes NMDAR-dependent LTP induction resulting in cognitive deficits.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 34818135\nTitle: Oligomeric A\u03b225-35 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs in rat hippocampal CA1 subfield.\nAbstract: Although amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the mechanisms of A\u03b2 neurotoxicity remain to be clarified. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of A\u03b2 on postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) tyrosine phosphorylation. Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying it may be a promising therapy in AD. A\u03b225-35 oligomers (20\u2009\u03bcg/rat) were administered intracerebroventricularly in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot was applied for measuring the protein levels of PSD-95 and \u03b2-actin. Following 3, 7, 14, 21\u2009days after oligomeric A\u03b225-35 treatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 increased significantly, and peaked at 3\u2009days after oligomeric A\u03b225-35 treatment in hippocampal CA1 subfield. Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SrcPTKs) specific inhibitor PP2 attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 induced by A\u03b225-35. Amantadine [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor noncompetitive antagonist], NVP-AAM077 (GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) and Ro25-6981 (GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) also suppressed the A\u03b225-35-induced PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that A\u03b2 oligomers induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs, which is mediated by the activation of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: PP2 treats Alzheimer\u2019s., which posits an interaction between Alzheimer\u2019s and PP2.
