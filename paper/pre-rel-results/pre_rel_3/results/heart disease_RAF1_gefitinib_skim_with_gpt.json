Germline-activating mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause about half of NS cases; other causative alleles include KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1 mutants. We showed previously that knock-in mice bearing the NS mutant Ptpn11(D61G) on a mixed 129S4/SvJae X C57BL6/J background exhibit all major NS features, including a variety of cardiac defects, with variable penetrance. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NS cardiac defects and whether genetic background and/or the specific NS mutation contribute to the NS phenotype remained unclear. Here, using an inducible knock-in approach, we show that all cardiac defects in NS result from mutant Shp2 expression in the endocardium, not in the myocardium or neural crest. Furthermore, the penetrance of NS defects is affected by genetic background and the specific Ptpn11 allele. Finally, ex vivo assays and pharmacological approaches show that NS mutants cause cardiac valve defects by increasing Erk MAPK activation, probably downstream of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases, extending the interval during which cardiac endocardial cells undergo endocardial-mesenchymal transformation. Our data provide a mechanistic underpinning for the cardiac defects in this disorder.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 24534818\nTitle: Cardiovascular disease in Noonan syndrome.\nAbstract: Noonan syndrome (NS), a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 1000 to 2500 live births, is the most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease after Trisomy 21. To comprehensively define the spectrum of cardiac morphology and specific clinical course of a large cohort of NS patients. Retrospective, descriptive case series study. An international Harvard-based NS registry was combined with clinical data from NS patients followed at Boston Children's Hospital, Massachusetts, USA. We identified 293 patients with NS. Cardiovascular disease was seen in 81% (n=237) including pulmonary stenosis in 57%, secundum atrial septal defects in 32% and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 16%. A genetic mutation of the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway was identified in 62% (n=136). Genotype-phenotype associations were noted between PTPN11 mutations and atrial septal defects (p=0.001), and pulmonary stenosis (p<0.001). RAF1 mutations were associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p<0.001). Cardiovascular outcomes that differed specifically in a NS cohort included high re-intervention rates (65%) after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for valvar pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, in NS patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a clinically significant regression of hypertrophy (17%) was observed as was a markedly higher incidence of concomitant congenital heart defects (70%). Patients with NS have a distinct spectrum of cardiac phenotypes that may have a natural history and response to therapy atypical to that normally seen in non-syndromic heart disease. A diagnosis of NS in a patient with pulmonary stenosis or infant-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would facilitate condition-specific counselling on outcome and prognosis.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30384889\nTitle: Genetic Basis of Severe Childhood-Onset\u00a0Cardiomyopathies.\nAbstract: Childhood cardiomyopathies are progressive and often lethal disorders, forming the most common cause of heart failure in children. Despite severe outcomes, their genetic background is still poorly characterized. The purpose of this study was to characterize the genetics of severe childhood cardiomyopathies in a countrywide cohort. The authors collected a countrywide cohort, KidCMP, of 66 severe childhood cardiomyopathies from the\u00a0sole center in Finland performing cardiac transplantation. For genetic diagnosis, next-generation sequencing and subsequent validation using genetic, cell biology, and computational approaches were used. The KidCMP cohort presents remarkable early-onset and severe disorders: the median age of diagnosis was 0.33 years, and 17 patients underwent cardiac transplantation. The authors identified the pathogenic variants in 39% of patients: 46% de novo, 34% recessive, and 20% dominantly-inherited. The authors report NRAP underlying childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as novel phenotypes for known heart disease genes. Some genetic diagnoses have immediate implications for treatment: CALM1 with life-threatening arrhythmias, and TAZ with good cardiac prognosis. The disease genes converge on metabolic causes (PRKAG2, MRPL44, AARS2, HADHB, DNAJC19, PPA2, TAZ, BAG3), MAPK pathways (HRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, TAB2), development (NEK8 and TBX20), calcium signaling (JPH2, CALM1, CACNA1C), and the sarcomeric contraction cycle (TNNC1, TNNI3, ACTC1, MYH7, NRAP). Childhood cardiomyopathies are typically caused by rare, family-specific mutations, most commonly de\u00a0novo, indicating that next-generation sequencing of trios is the approach of choice in their diagnosis. Genetic diagnoses may suggest intervention strategies and predict prognosis, offering valuable tools for prioritization of patients\u00a0for transplantation versus conservative treatment.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30805484\nTitle: Noonan syndrome-causing genes: Molecular update and an assessment of the mutation rate.\nAbstract: Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease and facial dysmorphia with an incidence of 1/1000 to 2500 live births. Up to now, several genes have been proven to be involved in the disturbance of the transduction signal through the RAS-MAP Kinase pathway and the manifestation of Noonan syndrome. The first gene described was <i>PTPN11</i>, followed by <i>SOS1</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and <i>RIT1</i>, and recently <i>SOS2</i>, <i>LZTR1</i>, and <i>A2ML1</i>, among others. Progressively, the physiopathology and molecular etiology of most signs of Noonan syndrome have been demonstrated, and inheritance patterns as well as genetic counseling have been established. In this review, we summarize the data concerning clinical features frequently observed in Noonan syndrome, and then, we describe the molecular etiology as well as the physiopathology of most Noonan syndrome-causing genes. In the second part of this review, we assess the mutational rate of Noonan syndrome-causing genes reported up to now in most screening studies. This review should give clinicians as well as geneticists a full view of the molecular aspects of Noonan syndrome and the authentic prevalence of the mutational events of its causing-genes. It will also facilitate laying the groundwork for future molecular diagnosis research, and the development of novel treatment strategies.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31130285\nTitle: Germline-Activating RRAS2 Mutations Cause Noonan Syndrome.\nAbstract: Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by distinctive craniofacial appearance, short stature, and congenital heart disease. Approximately 80% of individuals with NS harbor mutations in genes whose products are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the underlying genetic causes in nearly 20% of individuals with NS phenotype remain unexplained. Here, we report four de novo RRAS2 variants in three individuals with NS. RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A>T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in\u00a0vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A>T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly. The same dose injection of mRNA encoding c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu) caused severe developmental impairments and low dose overexpression of this variant induced craniofacial defects. In contrast, the RRAS2 c.224T>G (p.Phe75Cys) change, located on the same allele with p.Gln72His in an individual with NS, resulted in no aberrant in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo phenotypes by itself. Together, our findings suggest that activating RRAS2 mutations can cause NS and expand the involvement of RRAS2 proto-oncogene to rare germline\u00a0disorders.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 22907845\nTitle: Reversal of multidrug resistance by gefitinib via RAF1/ERK pathway in pancreatic cancer cell line.\nAbstract: Pancreatic cancer is a devastating malignancy, characterized by intrinsic or acquired resistance to conventional chemotherapies. Recent evidences suggest an involvement of tyrosine kinase pathway in the regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) protein gene expression. The aim of this study was to test whether gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor could regulate the MDR protein gene expression and sensitize the resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. The gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and PGP) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, and expression levels of various tyrosine kinases were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot in pancreatic cancer cell line. MTT assay was used for evaluating the effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutics induced drug resistance by regulating the gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3), and increased the gene expression of RAF1/ERK and the phosphorylation of ERK in pancreatic cancer Bxpc-3 cells. Gefitinib caused an inhibition of p-ERK tyrosine kinase activation in a dose-dependent manner, and reversed gemcitabine-induced RAF1/ERK gene expression and p-ERK activation. In addition, a reversal of MDR proteins gene expression was achieved by gefitinib, which sensitized resistant cells to gemcitabine. This study demonstrated that MDR of Bxpc-3 cell is involved in the RAF1/ERK tyrosine kinase pathway. Gefitinib reverses the MDR protein gene expression and restores sensitivity of resistant cells to gemcitabine via RAF1/ERK signaling pathway. Combination of gefitinib with conventional chemotherapeutic agents may offer a new approach for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26557760\nTitle: MicroRNA-7 enhances cytotoxicity induced by gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer via inhibiting the EGFR and IGF1R signalling pathways.\nAbstract: Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The ability of miR-7 to enhance gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was evaluated in this study. We found that miR-7 significantly decreased the IC50 of gefitinib and inhibited cell growth. G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were increased after the treatment of gefitinib coupled with miR-7 transfection. In addition, levels of Raf1, IGF1R, and PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK were also significantly decreased. Our results suggest that miR-7 may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLCs.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 25862004\nTitle: PTPIP51 levels in glioblastoma cells depend on inhibition of the EGF-receptor.\nAbstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) is upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and expression levels correlate with the grade of malignancy in gliomas. A similar correlation was reported for its interacting partner 14-3-3\u03b2, which has been shown to facilitate the interaction of PTPIP51 with cRAF (Raf1). Since the interaction of these signalling partners stimulates growth factor signalling downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a major drug target in GBM, we here investigated the impact of EGFR inhibition by small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibody on PTPIP51. The effect of EGFR inhibition on PTPIP51 mRNA, protein expression and its interaction profile in GBM was analyzed using the U87 cell line as model system. The transferability of the results to in vivo conditions was evaluated in cultured tumour cells from GBM patients. Cells were treated either to the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR Gefitinib or the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab in a time and dose dependent manner. Gefitinib treatment decreased the proliferation rate and induced apoptosis in U87 and primary tumour cells. The PTPIP51 interaction profile changed in correlation to the applied Gefitinib. Despite unchanged mRNA levels PTPIP51 protein was reduced. In contrast, treatment with Cetuximab had no effects on PTPIP51 expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the impact of EGFR inhibition by Gefitinib on PTPIP51 protein expression, a downstream regulator of MAPK signalling. These data will serve as a basis to unravel the precise role of PTPIP51-mediated signalling in GBM and its potential implications for Gefitinib-mediated therapy in future studies.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 37201366\nTitle: Caffeic acid phenethyl ester suppresses EGFR/FAK/Akt signaling, migration, and tumor growth of prostate cancer cells.\nAbstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). However, suppression of EGFR did not improve the patient outcome, possibly due to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in PCa. Compounds able to suppress both PI3K/Akt and EGFR signaling may be effective for treating advanced PCa. We examined if caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) simultaneously suppresses the EGFR and Akt signaling, migration and tumor growth in PCa cells. Wound healing assay, transwell migration assay and xenograft mice model were used to determine the effects of CAPE on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to determine the effects of CAPE on EGFR and Akt signaling. CAPE treatment decreased the gene expression of HRAS, RAF1, AKT2, GSK3A, and EGF and the protein expression of phospho-EGFR (Y845, Y1069, Y1148, Y1173), phospho-FAK, Akt, and ERK1/2 in PCa cells. CAPE treatment inhibited the EGF-induced migration of PCa cells. Combined treatment of CAPE with EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed additive inhibition on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Injection of CAPE (15\u00a0mg/kg/3 days) for 14 days suppressed the tumor growth of prostate xenografts in nude mice as well as suppressed the levels of Ki67, phospho-EGFR Y845, MMP-9, phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Ras, and Raf-1 in prostate xenografts. Our study suggested that CAPE can simultaneously suppress the EGFR and Akt signaling in PCa cells and is a potential therapeutic agent for advanced PCa.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36092956\nTitle: SEC61G Promotes Cervical Cancer Proliferation by Activating MAPK Signaling Pathway.\nAbstract: The abnormal expression of SEC61G plays an important role in the development of various tumors. This study explored the effects of SEC61G on MAPK signaling pathway and proliferation of cervical cancer (CC) cells. shRNA was used to inhibit the expression of SEC61G and EdU to observe its effect on the proliferation of CC cell SiHa. The effect of SEC61G on invasion was evaluated by Transwell assay. TCGA database was used to analyze the influence of high or low SEC61G expression level on the overall survival of CC patients. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of SEC61G, p-RAF1, Raf1, p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in cells. SiHa cells overexpressing SEC61G (SiHa-SEC61G) and control group (SiHa-mock) were subcutaneously implanted in nude mice. The tumor growth curve was measured at the specified time points between SiHa-SEC61G and SiHa-mock. The inhibitory effect of gefitinib on SEC61G was further evaluated. In patients with CC, high SEC61G expression predicted poor prognosis. Silencing SEC61G inhibited proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro. Overexpression of SEC61G can promote the proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of SEC61G promoted the proliferation of CC xenografts. Knocking down SEC61G can inhibit MAPK signaling pathway. Gefitinib can inhibit CC proliferation and tumor growth by SEC61G. SEC61G is highly expressed in CC and has poor prognosis. Inhibition of SEC61G expression can effectively inhibit the growth and proliferation of human CC cells. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between heart disease and gefitinib through their own interactions with RAF1.

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 36756695\nTitle: BASP1 promotes high glucose-induced endothelial apoptosis in diabetes via activation of EGFR signaling.\nAbstract: Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease of glucose metabolism. Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to reveal the expression of BASP1 and its biological roles in endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. By analyzing the databases related to diabetes complicated with coronary heart disease, BASP1 was screened out as an upregulated gene. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary mouse aortic endothelial cells were treated with high glucose to establish cell models of diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction, and the expression changes of BASP1 were verified by RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. BASP1 was silenced or overexpressed by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, and its effects on cell migration, apoptosis, tube formation, inflammatory response, and ROS were detected. The possible signaling pathway of BASP1 was found and the mechanism of BASP1 on promoting the progression of endothelial dysfunction was explored using the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the expression of BASP1 in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant coronary heart disease was increased. High glucose induced the upregulation of BASP1 expression in endothelial cells, and showed a time-dependent relationship. Silencing of BASP1 alleviated the damage of high glucose to endothelial cells. BASP1 regulated EGFR positively. The promoting effect of BASP1 on endothelial cell apoptosis may be achieved by regulating the EGFR pathway. BASP1 promotes endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose in patients with diabetes, which may be activated by activating the EGFR pathway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: gefitinib treats heart disease., which posits an interaction between heart disease and gefitinib.
