Zileuton Inhibits 5-LOX:**\n\n- Multiple abstracts confirm that **zileuton is a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)**.\n  - **Abstract PMID: 18281656** mentions a trial where zileuton was used as a 5-LOX inhibitor.\n  - **Abstracts PMID: 33222622** and **PMID: 32031284** discuss zileuton as a positive control for 5-LOX inhibition.\n  - **Abstract PMID: 31796842** demonstrates that **zileuton inhibits 5-LOX**, leading to decreased levels of leukotriene B4 (LTB4).\n\n**2. 5-LOX Involvement in Diabetes:**\n\n- **Abstract PMID: 23143785** indicates that **curcumin**, which modulates multiple signaling molecules including **5-LOX**, shows protection against diseases such as **diabetes**.\n  - This suggests that **modulation (likely inhibition) of 5-LOX may have beneficial effects in diabetes**.\n- **Abstract PMID: 33567774** discusses the role of bioactive lipids and 5-LOX in metabolic abnormalities associated with aging, including **metabolic diseases like diabetes**.\n  - The abstract suggests that **changes in the metabolism of bioactive lipids as a result of altered activities of 5-LOX may have a critical role in determining cell age and development of several aging-associated diseases**, including metabolic disorders.\n\n**3. Integration of Evidence:**\n\n- Since **zileuton inhibits 5-LOX**, and **inhibition of 5-LOX may be beneficial in diabetes** (as suggested by curcumin's protective effects), there is a logical connection that **zileuton could potentially treat diabetes through its effect on 5-LOX**.\n\n**4. Nature and Directionality of Interactions:**\n\n- The interaction between **zileuton and 5-LOX is inhibitory**.\n  - **Zileuton inhibits 5-LOX**, decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.\n- The relationship between **5-LOX activity and diabetes appears to be that increased 5-LOX activity may contribute to metabolic abnormalities**, suggesting that **inhibition is beneficial**.\n- Therefore, the **inhibition of 5-LOX by zileuton aligns with a potential therapeutic effect in diabetes**.\n\n**5.

While acute inflammation is a part of the defense response, chronic inflammation can lead to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological diseases. Several pro-inflammatory gene products have been identified that mediate a critical role in suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Among these gene products are TNF and members of its superfamily, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, chemokines, MMP-9, VEGF, COX-2, and 5-LOX. The expression of all these genes are mainly regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is constitutively active in most tumors and is induced by carcinogens (such as cigarette smoke), tumor promoters, carcinogenic viral proteins (HIV-tat, HIV-nef, HIV-vpr, KHSV, EBV-LMP1, HTLV1-tax, HPV, HCV, and HBV), chemotherapeutic agents, and gamma-irradiation. These observations imply that anti-inflammatory agents that suppress NF-kappaB or NF-kappaB-regulated products should have a potential in both the prevention and treatment of cancer. The current review describes in detail the critical link between inflammation and cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 23143785\nTitle: Therapeutic roles of curcumin: lessons learned from clinical trials.\nAbstract: Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, \u03b2-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-\u03baB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31687648\nTitle: Impaired Gastric Hormone Regulation of Osteoblasts and Lysyl Oxidase Drives Bone Disease in Diabetes Mellitus.\nAbstract: Diabetic bone disease is a complication of type I and type II diabetes, both of which are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. Increased hip and foot fracture rates do not correlate well with changes in bone mineral density (BMD), whereas studies support the importance of collagen structure to bone strength. Extracellular lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens resulting in aldehydes that subsequently form critically important biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. Although LOX-dependent biosynthetic crosslinks in bone collagen are deficient in diabetic bone, the expression and regulation of bone LOXs in diabetes have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. Moreover, we have identified a novel metabolic regulatory relationship that is dysregulated in diabetes using mouse models. Data indicate that the incretin (gastric hormone) known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that is anabolic to osteoblasts strongly upregulates LOX, and that this regulation is disrupted in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in mice. In vivo and in vitro studies support that diabetes results in elevated circulating peripheral dopamine, likely also derived from the gut, and is responsible for blocking GIP signaling and LOX levels in osteoblasts. Moreover, peripheral administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride to diabetic mice restored trabecular bone structure to near normal and partially reversed downregulation of LOX. Taken together our data identifies a novel metabolic relationship between the gut-derived hormone GIP and bone-derived LOX, and points to the importance of LOX dysregulation in the pathology of diabetic bone disease. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32182251\nTitle: LOX-1: A potential driver of cardiovascular risk in SLE patients.\nAbstract: Traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes do not explain the increased CVD burden in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The oxidized-LDL receptor, LOX-1, is an inflammation-induced receptor implicated in atherosclerotic plaque formation in acute coronary syndrome, and here we evaluated its role in SLE-associated CVD. SLE patients have increased sLOX-1 levels which were associated with elevated proinflammatory HDL, oxLDL and hsCRP. Interestingly, increased sLOX-1 levels were associated with patients with early disease onset, low disease activity, increased IL-8, and normal complement and hematological measures. LOX-1 was increased on patient-derived monocytes and low-density granulocytes, and activation with oxLDL and immune-complexes increased membrane LOX-1, TACE activity, sLOX-1 release, proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes, and triggered the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps which can promote vascular injury. In conclusion, perturbations in the lipid content in SLE patients' blood activate LOX-1 and promote inflammatory responses. Increased sLOX-1 levels may be an indicator of high CVD risk, and blockade of LOX-1 may provide a therapeutic opportunity for ameliorating atherosclerosis in SLE patients.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33567774\nTitle: \"Cell Membrane Theory of Senescence\" and the Role of Bioactive Lipids in Aging, and Aging Associated Diseases and Their Therapeutic Implications.\nAbstract: Lipids are an essential constituent of the cell membrane of which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the most important component. Activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) induces the release of PUFAs from the cell membrane that form precursors to both pro- and ant-inflammatory bioactive lipids that participate in several cellular processes. PUFAs GLA (gamma-linolenic acid), DGLA (dihomo-GLA), AA (arachidonic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are derived from dietary linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) by the action of desaturases whose activity declines with age. Consequently, aged cells are deficient in GLA, DGLA, AA, AA, EPA and DHA and their metabolites. LA, ALA, AA, EPA and DHA can also be obtained direct from diet and their deficiency (fatty acids) may indicate malnutrition and deficiency of several minerals, trace elements and vitamins some of which are also much needed co-factors for the normal activity of desaturases. In many instances (patients) the plasma and tissue levels of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA are low (as seen in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus) but they do not have deficiency of other nutrients. Hence, it is reasonable to consider that the deficiency of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA noted in these conditions are due to the decreased activity of desaturases and elongases. PUFAs stimulate SIRT1 through protein kinase A-dependent activation of SIRT1-PGC1\u03b1 complex and thus, increase rates of fatty acid oxidation and prevent lipid dysregulation associated with aging. SIRT1 activation prevents aging. Of all the SIRTs, SIRT6 is critical for intermediary metabolism and genomic stability. SIRT6-deficient mice show shortened lifespan, defects in DNA repair and have a high incidence of cancer due to oncogene activation. SIRT6 overexpression lowers LDL and triglyceride level, improves glucose tolerance, and increases lifespan of mice in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects at the transcriptional level. PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory metabolites influence the activity of SIRT6 and other SIRTs and thus, bring about their actions on metabolism, inflammation, and genome maintenance. GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (pro- and anti-inflammatory metabolites of AA respectively) activate/suppress various SIRTs (SIRt1 SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6), PPAR-\u03b3, PARP, p53, SREBP1, intracellular cAMP content, PKA activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PGC1-\u03b1). This implies that changes in the metabolism of bioactive lipids as a result of altered activities of desaturases, COX-2 and 5-, 12-, 15-LOX (cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenases respectively) may have a critical role in determining cell age and development of several aging associated diseases and genomic stability and gene and oncogene activation. Thus, methods designed to maintain homeostasis of bioactive lipids (GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA, DHA, PGE2, LXA4) may arrest aging process and associated metabolic abnormalities.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 21307302\nTitle: 5-Lipoxygenase metabolite 4-HDHA is a mediator of the antiangiogenic effect of \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.\nAbstract: Lipid signaling is dysregulated in many diseases with vascular pathology, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. To better understand the protective effects of \u03c9-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. \u03c9-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary \u03c9-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the \u03c9-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that \u03c9-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of \u03c9-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation. It also suggests that cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen (but not lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton) might be used without losing the beneficial effect of dietary \u03c9-3 PUFA.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 18281656\nTitle: Eicosanoid modulation in advanced lung cancer: cyclooxygenase-2 expression is a positive predictive factor for celecoxib + chemotherapy--Cancer and Leukemia Group B Trial 30203.\nAbstract: Increased expression of eicosanoids in cancer has been associated with adverse prognosis. We performed a randomized phase II trial to test the hypothesis that inhibitors of two eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], celecoxib and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX], zileuton) added to chemotherapy would improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC, a performance status of 0 to 2, and no prior therapy were eligible. All patients received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 mg/mL x min day 1 + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) days 1 and 8. Patients were randomly assigned to: (a) zileuton 600 mg PO qid, (b) celecoxib 400 mg PO bid, or (c) celecoxib and zileuton at the same doses. Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and 5-LOX was performed without knowledge of outcomes. One hundred forty patients were entered and 134 were eligible and treated. There was no survival difference between the arms. COX-2 expression was a negative prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.51, P = .019 for index >or= 4; HR = 4.16, P = .005 for index = 9) for patients not receiving celecoxib. Patients with increased COX-2 expression (index >or= 4), receiving celecoxib had better survival than did COX-2-expressing patients not receiving drug (HR = .342, P = .005 for OS; HR = .294, P = .002 for failure-free survival). Multivariate analysis confirmed the interaction of COX-2 and celecoxib on survival. 5-LOX expression was neither prognostic nor predictive. This study failed to demonstrate the value of dual eicosanoid inhibition or benefit from either agent alone in addition to chemotherapy. However, a prospectively defined subset analysis suggests an advantage for celecoxib and chemotherapy for patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33222622\nTitle: Potential of pyrroquinazoline alkaloids from <i>Adhatoda vasica</i> Nees. as inhibitors of 5-LOX - a computational and an <i>in-vitro</i> study.\nAbstract: Inflammation plays a major role in the onset and progression of many diseases related to the respiratory system. Cysteinyl leukotrienes, the products of 5-LOX are a potent bronchoconstrictor. Vasicine, vasicinone and deoxyvasicine are the pyrroquinazoline alkaloids of <i>Adhatoda vasica</i> that are well known for their bronchodilatory activity. The current investigation evaluates the 5-LOX inhibitory potential of these alkaloids. Molecular docking results indicated that these alkaloids have similar binding energy as that of Zileuton, a commercial drug. Analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations, the binding free energy derived from MM-PBSA and interaction entropy indicated that vasicinone (-8.33\u2009kcal/mol) exhibited a binding free energy comparable to that of Zileuton (-8.52\u2009kcal/mol). The in-vitro results indicate the potential of vasicinone as a competitive inhibitor, while the in-silico results highlighted the potential of vasicine and deoxyvasicine as allosteric inhibitors. A possible mechanism behind the activity exhibited by the plant was also determined, which emphasized the potential of these alkaloids as leads for the design of novel 5-LOX inhibitors.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32031284\nTitle: Synthesis and biological evaluation of pyrazolone analogues as potential anti-inflammatory agents targeting cyclooxygenases and 5-lipoxygenase.\nAbstract: New pyrazolone derivatives structurally related to celecoxib and FPL 62064 were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenases (COXs) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and their selectivity indices were calculated. The results showed that compounds 3f, 3h, 3l, and 3p have an excellent COX-2 selectivity index. Moreover, they showed potent 5-LOX inhibitory activity relative to celecoxib and zileuton, as positive controls. These promising candidates were further investigated for anti-inflammatory activity using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema method and ulcerogenic liability. The results showed no ulceration, which implies their gastric safety profile. Moreover, these compounds were evaluated for prostaglandin (PGE2) production in rat serum. Molecular docking in the COX-2 and 5-LOX active sites was performed to rationalize their anti-inflammatory activities. Strong binding interactions and effective docking scores were identified. The results indicated that these derivatives are good leads for dual-acting COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors to be used as potent and safe anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31796842\nTitle: Participation of 5-lipoxygenase and LTB4 in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.\nAbstract: Regeneration is the unmatched liver ability for recovering its functional mass after tissue lost. Leukotrienes (LT) are a family of eicosanoids with the capacity of signaling to promote proliferation. We analyzed the impact of blocking LT synthesis during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Male Wistar rats were subjected to two-third PH and treated with zileuton, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Our first find was a significant increment of intrahepatic LTB4 during the first hour after PH together with an increase in 5-LOX expression. Zileuton reduced hepatic LTB4 levels at the moment of hepatectomy and also inhibited the increase in hepatic LTB4. This inhibition produced a delay in liver proliferation as seen by decreased PCNA and cyclin D1 nuclear expression 24\u2009h post-PH. Results also showed that hepatic LTB4 diminution by zileuton was associated with a decrease in NF-\u0138B activity. Additionally, decreased hepatic LTB4 levels by zileuton affected the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) from zileuton-treated PH-rats displayed higher apoptosis than NPCs from PH control rats. In conclusion, the present work provides evidences that 5-LOX activation and its product LTB4 are involved in the initial signaling events for liver regeneration after PH and the pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme can delay the initial time course of the phenomenon.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between diabetes and zileuton through their own interactions with LOX.

                "**Score: -2 Points**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe hypothesis posits that \"zileuton treats diabetes.\" Based on the provided abstracts, there is consistent evidence that refutes this hypothesis.\n\n**Abstract 1 (PMID: 20510456):**\n\n- **Context:** The study examines the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor that blocks LT synthesis, is used to assess its impact on phagocytosis.\n  \n- **Findings:**\n  - In **non-diabetic rats**, treatment with zileuton significantly **reduced AM phagocytosis**. This indicates that LTs are crucial for normal phagocytic function.\n  - In **diabetic rats**, AMs already exhibit **impaired phagocytosis** compared to non-diabetic rats. Treatment with zileuton **did not further reduce phagocytosis**, suggesting that the impairment is due to deficient LT signaling inherent in diabetes.\n  - Addition of exogenous LTs (LTB\u2084 or LTD\u2084) **restored phagocytosis** in both diabetic and non-diabetic rats.\n  - Insulin enhanced phagocytosis by increasing PKC-delta phosphorylation, highlighting insulin's role in improving immune function in diabetes.\n\n- **Interpretation:** Zileuton **does not improve phagocytic function** in diabetic rats. Instead, inhibiting LT synthesis with zileuton impairs phagocytosis in non-diabetic rats and has **no beneficial effect** in diabetic rats. Therefore, zileuton does not treat the impaired immune function associated with diabetes; if anything, it might exacerbate it in non-diabetic conditions.\n\n**Abstract 2 (PMID: 12649539):**\n\n- **Context:** The study investigates the effects of FLAP (5-LO activating protein) and 5-LO inhibition on proteinuria in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Zileuton (a 5-LO inhibitor) and a FLAP antagonist (BAY X-1005) are evaluated.\n\n- **Findings:**\n  - **FLAP antagonist treatment** significantly **reduced proteinuria** in diabetic rats, suggesting a beneficial effect on diabetic nephropathy.\n  - **Zileuton treatment** **did not reduce proteinuria**, indicating that 5-LO inhibition alone is insufficient to confer renal benefits in diabetic rats.\n  - Diabetes-induced increases in leukotriene production were not modified by either inhibitor, suggesting that FLAP's role in proteinuria may be independent of its role in leukotriene synthesis.\n  - Increased FLAP expression correlated with increased albumin permeability, which was reversed by FLAP antagonists but not by zileuton.\n\n- **Interpretation:** Zileuton **fails to improve** a key diabetic complication\u2014proteinuria\u2014in this model. The beneficial effects are specific to FLAP antagonism and not observed with 5-LO inhibition by zileuton. This suggests that zileuton does not treat, and does not contribute to treating, diabetic nephropathy.\n\n**Logical Conclusion:**\n\n- **Directionality of Interaction:** In both studies, zileuton **does not exhibit a therapeutic benefit** in the context of diabetes. In the first study, it fails to restore impaired phagocytosis in diabetic rats and reduces phagocytic function in non-diabetic rats. In the second study, it does not ameliorate proteinuria in diabetic rats.\n\n- **Contradiction to Hypothesis:** The consistent lack of beneficial effects\u2014and the potential for detrimental effects\u2014indicates that zileuton does not treat diabetes. There is **no evidence** supporting the hypothesis, and the findings directly **contradict** it.\n\n- **No Conflicting Evidence:** Both abstracts provide cohesive evidence that zileuton is **ineffective** in treating diabetes or its complications, with **no contradictory evidence** suggesting a therapeutic role.\n\n**Scoring Justification:**\n\nAccording to the scoring guidelines:\n\n- **\"-2\":** The hypothesis is **refuted** by consistent evidence indicating that the interaction between diabetes and zileuton **contradicts** the proposed outcome, with no significant contradictory evidence.\n\nGiven that both studies consistently show that zileuton **does not treat** diabetes and may even have adverse effects in related contexts, the hypothesis is clearly refuted.\n\n**Therefore, the assigned score is -2.**"

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 20510456\nTitle: Impaired phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages from diabetic rats is related to the deficient coupling of LTs to the Fc gamma R signaling cascade.\nAbstract: Diabetic individuals are more susceptible to infections and this seems to be related to impaired phagocyte function. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the first barrier to prevent respiratory infections. Leukotrienes (LTs) increase AM phagocytic activity via Fc gamma R. In this study, we compared AMs from diabetic and non-diabetic rats for phagocytosis via Fc gamma R and the roles of LTs and insulin. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by alloxan (42 mg/kg, i.v.); macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and IgG-opsonised sheep red blood cells (IgG-SRBC) were used as targets. LTs were added to the AMs 5 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC. AMs were treated with a LT synthesis inhibitor (zileuton, 10 microM), or antagonists of the LTB(4) receptor (CP105.696, 10 microM) or cys-LT receptor (MK571, 10 microM), 30 or 20 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC, respectively. We found that the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC by AMs from diabetic rats is impaired compared with non-diabetic rats. Treatment with the LT inhibitor/antagonists significantly reduced AM phagocytosis in non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. During the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC LTB(4) and LTC(4) were produced by AMs from both groups. The addition of exogenous LTB(4) or LTD(4) potentiated phagocytosis similarly in both groups. Phagocytosis was followed by the phosphorylation of PKC-delta, ERK and Akt. This was reduced by zileuton treatment in AMs from non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. The addition of insulin to AMs further increased the phagocytosis by increasing PKC-delta phosphorylation. These results suggest that the impaired phagocytosis found in AMs from diabetic rats is related to a deficient coupling of LTs to the Fc gamma R signaling cascade and that insulin has a key role in this coupling. An essential role for insulin in innate immunity is suggested.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 12649539\nTitle: Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats.\nAbstract: The binding of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to the 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) is a prerequisite for subsequent formation of leukotrienes (LT) from arachidonic acid. We have shown that FLAP antagonist administration decreased proteinuria in glomerulonephritic patients. In this follow-up study, we assessed the role for FLAP in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with FLAP (BAY X-1005, 200 mg/kg) or 5-LO (Zileuton, 80 mg/Kg) antagonists. Proteinuria, renal function and LT production was assessed. We also determined protein permeability of cultured glomerular endothelial cells (which possess no 5-LO) by measuring their permeability to radiolabeled albumin with and without FLAP antagonists. FLAP mRNA levels increased dramatically in glomeruli from diabetic animals compared to controls. Inhibition of FLAP (but not inhibition of 5-LO) reduced proteinuria, with no effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Interestingly, diabetes-induced rises in urinary excretion and glomerular production of leukotrienes were not modified by the inhibitors. Increased FLAP expression in glomerular endothelial cells in culture was associated with an increase in albumin permeability, and this increase was abolished by FLAP antagonists. On the other hand, addition of LTA(4) led to increases in leukotriene formation and in permeability. This increase in permeability was also reduced by co-incubation with FLAP antagonists, whereas the increase in leukotriene synthesis was not modified. These results suggest a role for FLAP other than the activation of 5-LO, possibly in protein handling, and point to FLAP antagonists as anti-proteinuric agents.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: zileuton treats diabetes., which posits an interaction between diabetes and zileuton.
