            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 24025713\nTitle: Targeting of NAD metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells: potential novel therapy for pancreatic tumors.\nAbstract: Here, we describe a novel interplay between NAD synthesis and degradation involved in pancreatic tumor growth. We used human pancreatic cancer cells, both in vitro (cell culture experiments) and in vivo (xenograft experiments), to demonstrate the role of NAD synthesis and degradation in tumor cell metabolism and growth. We demonstrated that pharmacologic and genetic targeting of Nampt, the key enzyme in the NAD salvage synthesis pathway, inhibits cell growth and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These changes were accompanied by a reduction of NAD levels, glycolytic flux, lactate production, mitochondrial function, and levels of ATP. The massive reduction in overall metabolic activity induced by Nampt inhibition was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in pancreatic tumor growth. The results of the mechanistic experiments showed that neither the NAD-dependent enzymes PARP-1 nor SIRT1 play a significant role on the effect of Nampt inhibition on pancreatic cancer cells. However, we identified a role for the NAD degradation pathway mediated by the NADase CD38 on the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. The responsiveness to Nampt inhibition is modulated by the expression of CD38; low levels of this enzyme decrease the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. In contrast, its overexpression decreased cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and further increased the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. Our study demonstrates that NAD metabolism is essential for pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation and that targeting NAD synthesis via the Nampt pathway could lead to novel therapeutic treatments for pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 28507103\nTitle: Nicotinic Acid Phosphoribosyltransferase Regulates Cancer Cell Metabolism, Susceptibility to NAMPT Inhibitors, and DNA Repair.\nAbstract: In the last decade, substantial efforts have been made to identify NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis inhibitors, specifically against nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), as preclinical studies indicate their potential efficacy as cancer drugs. However, the clinical activity of NAMPT inhibitors has proven limited, suggesting that alternative NAD<sup>+</sup> production routes exploited by tumors confer resistance. Here, we show the gene encoding nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a second NAD<sup>+</sup>-producing enzyme, is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of common types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, where NAPRT expression correlates with a BRCAness gene expression signature. Both NAPRT and NAMPT increased intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. NAPRT silencing reduced energy status, protein synthesis, and cell size in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. NAPRT silencing sensitized cells to NAMPT inhibitors both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>; similar results were obtained with the NAPRT inhibitor 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. Reducing NAPRT levels in a BRCA2-deficient cancer cell line exacerbated DNA damage in response to chemotherapeutics. In conclusion, NAPRT-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis contributes to cell metabolism and to the DNA repair process in a subset of tumors. This knowledge could be used to increase the efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors and chemotherapy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3857-69. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36428689\nTitle: The NAMPT Inhibitor FK866 Increases Metformin Sensitivity in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.\nAbstract: Pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: PDAC) is one of the most aggressive neoplastic diseases. Metformin use has been associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence and better survival in diabetics. Metformin has been shown to inhibit PDAC cells growth and survival, both in vitro and in vivo. However, clinical trials using metformin have failed to reduce pancreatic cancer progression in patients, raising important questions about molecular mechanisms that protect tumor cells from the antineoplastic activities of metformin. We confirmed that metformin acts through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, decreasing the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, and that NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH homeostasis determines metformin sensitivity in several cancer cell lines. Metabolites that can restore the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio caused PDAC cells to be resistant to metformin. In addition, metformin treatment of PDAC cell lines induced a compensatory NAMPT expression, increasing the pool of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. The NAMPT inhibitor FK866 sensitized PDAC cells to the antiproliferative effects of metformin in vitro and decreased the cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pool. Intriguingly, FK866 combined with metformin increased survival in mice bearing KP4 cell line xenografts, but not in mice with PANC-1 cell line xenografts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the drug combination reactivated genes in the p53 pathway and oxidative stress, providing new insights about the mechanisms leading to cancer cell death.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 35724566\nTitle: Identification of new FK866 analogues with potent anticancer activity against pancreatic cancer.\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal diseases for which chemotherapy has not been very successful yet. FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) is a well-known NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) inhibitor with anti-cancer activities, but it failed in phase II clinical trials. We found that FK866 shows anti-proliferative activity in three PDAC cell lines, as well as in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells. More than 50 FK866 analogues were synthesized that introduce substituents on the phenyl ring of the piperidine benzamide group of FK866 and exchange its buta-1,4-diyl tether for 1-oxyprop-3-yl, (E)-but-2-en-1,4-diyl and 2- and 3-carbon tethers. The pyridin-3-yl moiety of FK866 was exchanged for chlorinated and fluorinated analogues and for pyrazin-2-yl and pyridazin-4-yl groups. Several compounds showed low nanomolar or sub-nanomolar cell growth inhibitory activity. Our best cell anti-proliferative compounds were the 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzamide analogue of FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-(2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoyl)piperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) (9), the 2,6-dimethoxybenzamide (8) and 2-methoxybenzamide (4), which exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.16\u00a0nM, 0.004\u00a0nM and 0.08\u00a0nM toward PDAC cells, respectively.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 37242714\nTitle: Iminosugar-Based Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) Inhibitors as Potential Anti-Pancreatic Cancer Agents.\nAbstract: The nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is considered a very promising therapeutic target because it is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Although many inhibitors have been prepared and tested, clinical trials have shown that NAMPT inhibition may result in severe haematological toxicity. Therefore, the development of conceptually new inhibitors is an important and challenging task. We synthesized ten \u03b2-d-iminoribofuranosides bearing various heterocycle-based chains carbon-linked to the anomeric position starting from non-carbohydrate derivatives. They were then submitted to NAMPT inhibition assays, as well as to pancreatic tumor cells viability and intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion evaluation. The biological activity of the compounds was compared to that of the corresponding analogues lacking the carbohydrate unit to assess, for the first time, the contribution of the iminosugar moiety to the properties of these potential antitumor agents.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 35818423\nTitle: Regulation of appetite-related neuropeptides by Panax ginseng: A novel approach for obesity treatment.\nAbstract: Obesity is a primary factor provoking various chronic disorders, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and causes the death of 2.8 million individuals each year. Diet, physical activity, medications, and surgery are the main therapies for overweightness and obesity. During weight loss therapy, a decrease in energy stores activates appetite signaling pathways under the regulation of neuropeptides, including anorexigenic [corticotropin-releasing hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cholecystokinin (CCK), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript] and orexigenic [agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and melanin-concentrating hormone] neuropeptides, which increase food intake and lead to failure in attaining weight loss goals. Ginseng and ginsenosides reverse these signaling pathways by suppressing orexigenic neuropeptides (NPY and AgRP) and provoking anorexigenic neuropeptides (CCK and POMC), which prevent the increase in food intake. Moreover, the results of network pharmacology analysis have revealed that constituents of ginseng radix, including campesterol, beta-elemene, ginsenoside Rb1, biotin, and pantothenic acid, are highly correlated with neuropeptide genes that regulate energy balance and food intake, including <i>ADIPOQ</i>, <i>NAMPT</i>, <i>UBL5</i>, <i>NUCB2</i>, <i>LEP</i>, <i>CCK</i>, <i>GAST</i>, <i>IGF1</i>, <i>RLN1</i>, <i>PENK</i>, <i>PDYN</i>, and <i>POMC</i>. Based on previous studies and network pharmacology analysis data, ginseng and its compounds may be a potent source for obesity treatment by regulating neuropeptides associated with appetite.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 38003249\nTitle: Regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH Redox Involves the Protective Effects of Ginsenoside Rb1 against Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Astrocyte Lesions.\nAbstract: The aim of this study was to investigate NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox regulation in astrocytes by Ginsenoside Rb1 subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and to reveal the neuroprotective mechanism of ginseng. Neonatal mouse brain was used to culture primary astrocytes. The third generation of the primary astrocytes was used for the experiments. OGD/R was introduced by culturing the cells in a glucose-free media under nitrogen for 6 h followed by a regular culture for 24 h. Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury in a dose-dependent manner. It improved the mitochondrial function of OGD/R astrocytes indicated by improving mitochondrial distribution, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhancing mitochondrial DNA copies and ATP production. Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly lifted intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH, NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>, and GSH/GSSG in OGD/R astrocytes. It inhibited the protein expression of both PARP1 and CD38, while attenuating the SIRT1 drop in OGD/R cells. In line with its effects on PARP1, Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced the expression of poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) proteins in OGD/R cells. Ginsenoside Rb1 also significantly increased the expression of NAMPT and NMNAT2, both of which are key players in NAD/NADH synthesis. The results suggest that the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox involves the protective effects of ginsenoside Rb1 against OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36948143\nTitle: Therapeutic application of natural products: NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism as potential target.\nAbstract: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) metabolism is involved in the entire physiopathological process and is critical to human health. Long-term imbalance in NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is associated with various diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, aging, and cancer, making it a potential target for effective therapeutic strategies. Currently, several natural products that target NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism have been widely reported to have significant therapeutic effects, but systematic summaries are lacking. To summarize the latest findings on the prevention and treatment of various diseases through the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism by various natural products in vivo and in vitro models, and evaluate the toxicities of the natural products. PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were searched using the keywords \"natural products sources,\" \"toxicology,\" \"NAD<sup>+</sup> clinical trials,\" and \"NAD<sup>+</sup>,\" and/or paired with \"natural products\" and \"diseases\" for studies published within the last decade until January 2023. We found that the natural products mainly include phenols (curcumin, cyclocurcumin, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, salvianolic acid B, pterostilbene, EGCG), flavonoids (pinostrobin, apigenin, acacetin, tilianin, kaempferol, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, luteolin, silybin, hydroxysafflor yellow A, scutellarin), glycosides (salidroside), quinones (emodin, embelin, \u03b2-LAPachone, shikonin), terpenoids (notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside F2, ginsenoside Rd, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rg3, thymoquinone, genipin), pyrazines (tetramethylpyrazine), alkaloids (evodiamine, berberine), and phenylpropanoids (ferulic acid). These natural products have antioxidant, energy-producing, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-aging effects, which mainly influence the NAMPT/NAD<sup>+</sup>/SIRT, AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf2/HO-1, PKCs/PARPs/NF-\u03baB, and AMPK/Nrf2/mTOR signaling pathways, thereby regulating NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism to prevent and treat various diseases. These natural products have been shown to be safe, tolerable and have fewer adverse effects in various in vivo and in vitro studies and clinical trials. We evaluated the toxic effects of natural products and summarized the available clinical trials on NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, as well as the recent advances in the therapeutic application of natural products targeting NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, with the aim to provide new insights into the treatment of multiple disorders.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between pancreatic cancer and ginsenoside rb1 through their own interactions with NAMPT.

                "Score: **+1** Point\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe hypothesis states that **ginsenoside Rb1 treats pancreatic cancer**. Analyzing the provided abstracts:\n\n**Abstract 1 (PMID: 7954360):** This study investigates the antitumor effects of components from 'Sho-saiko-to' on various human cancer cell lines, including a human pancreatic cancer cell line (BxPC-3). While several components showed significant inhibitory effects at low concentrations, **ginsenoside Rb1 required concentrations greater than 1000\u202f\u03bcg/ml to achieve 50% inhibition of cell growth** in hepatoma cells. This high required concentration indicates that ginsenoside Rb1 has **minimal antitumor activity** compared to other components tested. Additionally, there is no specific mention of ginsenoside Rb1's effect on the pancreatic cancer cell line in this abstract. Therefore, this abstract does **not provide strong support** for the hypothesis.\n\n**Abstract 2 (PMID: 27893436):** This study explores the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as carriers to enhance the anti-cancer activity of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1. The **ginsenoside Rb1-CNT conjugate (Rb-CNT) significantly decreased cell viability** by up to 62% in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and **enhanced antiproliferation of drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) by 61%**. The substantial inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation suggests that when **delivered via CNTs, ginsenoside Rb1 exhibits potent anti-cancer effects**. This provides **supportive evidence** for the hypothesis, highlighting a beneficial interaction between ginsenoside Rb1 and pancreatic cancer cells through enhanced delivery methods.\n\n**Abstract 3 (PMID: 36641437):** This study identifies key pharmacological components and targets of Aidi injection (ADI) in treating pancreatic cancer. **Ginsenoside Rb1 is recognized as one of the four active components of ADI**. In vivo experiments show that ADI significantly reduces tumor volume and weight in a pancreatic cancer xenograft model. Network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking predict that ginsenoside Rb1 has a high affinity for **CASP3**, a protein involved in apoptosis. This suggests that ginsenoside Rb1 may contribute to **inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells**, thereby reducing tumor growth. Although ginsenoside Rb1 is part of a combination therapy in ADI, this abstract **supports the hypothesis** by indicating a beneficial effect on pancreatic cancer.\n\n**Synthesis and Logical Inference:**\n\n- **Beneficial Interaction:** Abstracts 2 and 3 provide evidence that ginsenoside Rb1 can inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and may induce apoptosis, aligning with the proposed outcome of treating pancreatic cancer.\n  \n- **Role of Delivery Methods and Combination Therapy:** The enhanced effect observed in Abstract 2 is achieved through conjugation with CNTs, suggesting that **delivery methods influence the efficacy** of ginsenoside Rb1. In Abstract 3, the effect is part of a **combination therapy** (ADI), indicating that ginsenoside Rb1's therapeutic potential may be enhanced when used with other components.\n\n- **Uncertainty and Limitations:** Abstract 1 suggests that ginsenoside Rb1 alone has limited efficacy at practical concentrations, and there is **some uncertainty** about its effectiveness without enhanced delivery or combination with other agents.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence indicates that **ginsenoside Rb1 has the potential to treat pancreatic cancer**, especially when delivered effectively or used as part of a combination therapy. However, there is **some uncertainty due to limited efficacy** when used alone and the reliance on delivery methods to achieve significant effects.\n\n**Assigned Score:** **+1**\n\nThis score aligns with the **+1 guideline**: *\"The hypothesis is likely supported by the provided texts. The evidence suggests that the interaction between pancreatic cancer and ginsenoside Rb1 may align with the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\"*"

The concentration of each component required for 50% inhibition of cell growth of PLC/PRF/5 cells was as follows: saikosaponin-d, baicalin, 20 micrograms/ml; saikosaponin-a, baicalein, 50 micrograms/ml; saikosaponin-b2, -c, ginsenoside-Rb1, -Rg1, glycyrrhizin, > 1000 micrograms/ml. Saikosaponin-a in 50-micrograms/ml quantities inhibited the cell growth and DNA synthesis of all the cell lines tested. These results indicate that 'Sho-saiko-to' includes potent antitumor components such as saikosaponin-a, -d, baicalin against human hepatoma cells as well as other human cell lines.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 27893436\nTitle: Carbon nanotubes as carriers of Panax ginseng metabolites and enhancers of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 anti-cancer activity.\nAbstract: A major benefit to nanomaterial based-medicine is the ability to provide nanosized vehicles for sporadic metabolites. Here, we describe how the conjugation of valuable ginseng secondary metabolites (ginsenoside Rb1 or Rg1) with carbon nanotubes (CNT) can enhance their anti-proliferative and anti-cancer effects. Ginsenoside-CNT conjugate (Rb-CNT or Rg-CNT) permitted the ginsenosides to be used at a low dose, yet achieve a higher incidence of cancer killing. We were able to demonstrate that the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate can decrease cell viability up to 62% in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and enhance antiproliferation of drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) by 61%. The interaction of the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate with breast cancer cells was studied using Raman Spectroscopy mapping. Total transcriptome profiling (Affymetrix platform) of MCF-7 cells treated with the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate shows that a number of cellular, apoptotic and response to stimulus processes were affected. Therefore, our data confirmed the potential use of CNT as a drug delivery system.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36641437\nTitle: Identification of key pharmacological components and targets for Aidi injection in the treatment of pancreatic cancer by UPLC-MS, network pharmacology, and in vivo experiments.\nAbstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Aidi injection (ADI) is a representative antitumor medication based on Chinese herbal injection, but its antitumor mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, the subcutaneous xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was established in nude mice to investigate the anticancer effect of ADI in vivo. We then determined the components of ADI using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and explored the possible molecular mechanisms against pancreatic cancer using network pharmacology. In vivo experiments, the volume, weight, and degree of histological abnormalities of implanted tumors were significantly lower in the medium and high concentration ADI injection groups than in the control group. Network pharmacology analysis identified four active components of ADI and seven key targets, TNF, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, MAPK14, CASP3, P53 and JUN. Molecular docking also revealed high affinity between the active components and the target proteins, including Astragaloside IV to P53 and VEGFA, Ginsenoside Rb1 to CASP3 and Formononetin to JUN. ADI could reduce the growth rate of tumor tissue and alleviate the structural abnormalities in tumor tissue. ADI is predicted to act on VEGFA, P53, CASP3, and JUN in ADI-mediated treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: ginsenoside rb1 treats pancreatic cancer., which posits an interaction between pancreatic cancer and ginsenoside rb1.
