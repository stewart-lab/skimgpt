Wild-type and autophagic mediator ULK1 heterozygous knockout mice were induced to have NAFLD by high-fat diet for 8weeks. After that, resveratrol treatment was applied with the high-fat diet feeding for another 4weeks. Typical features of NAFLD, including histological changes, fibrosis, insulin resistance, oxidative status, and inflammation were characterized. After-treatment with resveratrol showed ameliorative effects on all measured features of NAFLD, from histology, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance to oxidative stress and inflammation. resveratrol treatment also reduced the activity of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) through the restoration of its inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1. Partial inhibition of ULK1 expression impaired the ameliorative effects of resveratrol on hepatic histology, fibrosis, oxidative status, inflammation, and NF-\u03baB activity. In conclusion, resveratrol improved NAFLD-caused hepatic injury partially through regulating autophagic and I\u03baB\u03b1-NF-\u03baB pathways.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32042044\nTitle: Fasting-induced FGF21 signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via JMJD3 histone demethylase.\nAbstract: Autophagy is essential for cellular survival and energy homeostasis under nutrient deprivation. Despite the emerging importance of nuclear events in autophagy regulation, epigenetic control of autophagy gene transcription remains unclear. Here, we report fasting-induced Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21) signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via Jumonji-D3 (JMJD3/KDM6B) histone demethylase. Upon FGF21 signaling, JMJD3 epigenetically upregulates global autophagy-network genes, including Tfeb, Atg7, Atgl, and Fgf21, through demethylation of histone H3K27-me3, resulting in autophagy-mediated lipid degradation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of JMJD3 at Thr-1044 by FGF21 signal-activated PKA increases its nuclear localization and interaction with the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b1 to transcriptionally activate autophagy. Administration of FGF21 in obese mice improves defective autophagy and hepatosteatosis in a JMJD3-dependent manner. Remarkably, in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, hepatic expression of JMJD3, ATG7, LC3, and ULK1 is substantially decreased. These findings demonstrate that FGF21-JMJD3 signaling epigenetically links nutrient deprivation with hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation in mammals.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31551937\nTitle: Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Induced by Perinatal Exposure to Bisphenol a Is Associated With Activated mTOR and TLR4/NF-\u03baB Signaling Pathways in Offspring Rats.\nAbstract: Accumulating evidence suggests a role of bisphenol A (BPA) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of lipogenic genes, but the mechanism of BPA induced lipogenic gene expression remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 \u03bcg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For 5 weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in liver, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased liver lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in liver of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB proteins were also significantly increased, and ER\u03b1 protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathways.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31191364\nTitle: Irbesartan Ameliorates Lipid Deposition by Enhancing Autophagy via PKC/AMPK/ULK1 Axis in Free Fatty Acid Induced Hepatocytes.\nAbstract: Irbesartan has shown significant therapeutic effects in hypertensive patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To determine the underlying mechanisms of its action, we established an <i>in vitro</i> model of NAFLD by treating human and mouse hepatocytes with free fatty acids (FFAs) and angiotensin (Ang) II. Irbesartan significantly reversed AngII/FFA-induced lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers. In addition, irbesartan also increased the autophagy flux, in terms of increased numbers of autolysosomes and autophagosomes, and the upregulation and mitochondrial localization of the autophagic proteins Atg5 and LC3BII/I. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of the autophagic flux exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in the steatotic hepatocytes. Furthermore, AngII upregulated PKC which inhibited AMPK phosphorylation via direct interaction with the AngII receptor AT1-R. Irbesartan inhibited PKC and activated AMPK and its downstream effector ULK1, thereby inducing autophagy, decreasing lipid deposition, and restoring mitochondrial function. Taken together, irbesartan triggers autophagy via the PKC/AMPK/ULK1 axis to ameliorate the pathological changes in the steatotic hepatocytes.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32240652\nTitle: Pyrvinium pamoate attenuates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: Insight on hedgehog/Gli and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling crosstalk.\nAbstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a devastating form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) has been recently introduced as anti-adipogenic compound. We aimed to investigate the effects of PP on high fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH in rats and examine the underlying mechanisms. NASH was induced by exposing rats to HFD for 16\u00a0weeks and a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) 35\u00a0mg/kg at the fifth week. At the tenth week, PP was given orally at a dose of 60\u00a0\u00b5g/kg, day after day for 6\u00a0weeks. HFD/STZ induced significant steatohepatitis and insulin resistance as was evident by the elevated transaminases activity, NAFLD activity score and HOMA-IR level. Also, HFD induced serum hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, HFD induced an imbalance in the oxidative status of the liver via upregulating lipid peroxides and mitochondrial oxidative stress markers (MnSOD, UCP-2), together with marked decrease in anti-oxidant glutathione level, glutathione peroxidase activity and expression of mitophagy related markers (PINK1, Parkin, ULK1) and increase in SQSTM1/p62 and LC3II/LC3I. Upregulation of inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and apoptotic marker (caspase 3) were observed. Those events all together precipitated in initiation of liver fibrosis as confirmed by elevation of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and liver collagen content. Co-treatment with PP protected against HFD-induced NASH and liver fibrosis via downregulating the expression of key factors in Hedgehog and Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. These findings imply that PP can attenuate the progression of NASH and its associated sequela of liver fibrosis.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 30244168\nTitle: BAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival by activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells.\nAbstract: B cell activating factor from the TNF family (BAFF) is implicated in not only the physiology of normal B cells, but also the pathophysiology of aggressive B cells related to malignant and autoimmune diseases. Autophagy plays a crucial role in balancing the beneficial and detrimental effects of immunity and inflammation. However, little is known about whether and how excessive BAFF mediates autophagy contributing to B-cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that excessive human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF) inhibited autophagy with a concomitant reduction of LC3-II in normal and B-lymphoid (Raji) cells. Knockdown of LC3 not only potentiated hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy, but also attenuated hsBAFF activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby diminishing hsBAFF-induced B-cell proliferation/viability. Further, we found that hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy was Akt/mTOR-dependent. This is supported by the findings that hsBAFF increased mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser757); Akt inhibitor X, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242, expression of dominant negative Akt, or knockdown of mTOR attenuated hsBAFF-induced phosphorylation of ULK1, decrease of LC3-II level, and increase of cell proliferation/viability. Chelating intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) with BAPTA/AM or preventing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation using EGTA or 2-APB profoundly blocked hsBAFF-induced activation of Akt/mTOR, phosphorylation of ULK1 and decrease of LC3-II, as well as increase of cell proliferation/viability. Similar effects were observed in the cells where CaMKII was inhibited by KN93 or knocked down by CaMKII shRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that hsBAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival through activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level or CaMKII, Akt, or mTOR activity to promote autophagy may be exploited for prevention of excessive BAFF-induced aggressive B lymphocyte disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26636543\nTitle: mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242 causes mitophagy terminated by apoptotic cell death in E1A-Ras transformed cells.\nAbstract: mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 target--ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin, pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, short-term pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria, which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles (mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death. Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell--survival or cell death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 29154199\nTitle: Ultraviolet B radiation down-regulates ULK1 and ATG7 expression and impairs the autophagy response in human keratinocytes.\nAbstract: Autophagy is a self-digestive pathway that helps to maintain cellular homeostasis, and many autophagy-related gene (ATG)s involved the regulation of the autophagy process. Ultraviolet light is a common stressor of skin, but it is unclear how autophagy is regulated after ultraviolet exposure in epidermal keratinocytes. Here, we found that the mRNAs of some key ATG genes such as ULK1, ATG5 and ATG7 exhibited significantly lower levels in the skin tissues of the face and chest with solar ultraviolet exposure, compared with perineal skin. Interestingly, UVB radiation down-regulated the expression of ULK1, ATG3 and ATG7, and it inhibited the autophagy flux via a mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR)-independent pathway in human keratinocytes. The inhibition of autophagy in UVB-treated keratinocytes cannot be restored by treatment with the MTOR-dependent autophagy inducer rapamycin. Importantly, UVB treatment perturbs the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II and LC3-II turnover in response to treatment with MTOR inhibitors (Torin 1 and pp242), as well as endoplasmic reticular stress (A23187 and tunicamycin), inositol pathway (L690,330) and autophagy inducers (resveratrol and STF62247). Our study demonstrates that UVB radiation down-regulates several key autophagy-related proteins and impairs the autophagy response in keratinocytes. This study demonstrates a linkage between autophagy and skin disorders associated with ultraviolet exposure.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 37886951\nTitle: Prior Treatment with AICAR Causes the Selective Phosphorylation of mTOR Substrates in C2C12 Cells.\nAbstract: Metabolic stress in skeletal muscle cells causes sustained metabolic changes, but the mechanisms of the prolonged effects are not fully known. In this study, we tested C2C12 cells with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulator AICAR and measured the changes in the metabolic pathways and signaling kinases. AICAR caused an acute increase in the phosphorylation of the AMPK target ULK1, the mTORC1 substrate S6K, and the mTORC2 target Akt. Intriguingly, prior exposure to AICAR only decreased glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity when it underwent three-hour recovery after exposure to AICAR in a bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (KHB) instead of Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM). The phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target S6K was increased after recovery in DMEM but not KHB, although this appeared to be specific to S6K, as the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target site on ULK1 was not altered when the cells recovered in DMEM. The phosphorylation of mTORC2 target sites was also heterogenous under these conditions, with Akt increasing at serine 473 while other targets (SGK1 and PKC\u03b1) were unaffected. The exposure of cells to rapamycin (an mTORC1 inhibitor) and PP242 (an inhibitor of both mTOR complexes) revealed the differential phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates. Taken together, the data suggest that prior exposure to AICAR causes the selective phosphorylation of mTOR substrates, even after prolonged recovery in a nutrient-replete medium.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242 through their own interactions with ULK1.

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nnan\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease., which posits an interaction between Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242. Use only the provided abstracts from PubMed that mention Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242 to inform your analysis.\n\nYour evaluation should:\n\n\u2022 Integrate evidence from all abstracts to discern how Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242 might be interconnected.\n\u2022 Employ logical reasoning, drawing logical inferences where appropriate, based on the interaction between Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242.\n\u2022 Assess the nature and directionality of the interaction, determining whether they are beneficial or detrimental to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.\n\u2022 Be vigilant for any evidence that contradicts or challenges the hypothesis, explicitly addressing any contradictions in your reasoning.\n\u2022 Avoid inferring effects not supported by the texts, ensuring that all conclusions are grounded in the provided information.\n\u2022 Ensure that your scoring reflects an unbiased assessment based solely on the provided evidence, considering logical inferences from evidence.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\u2022 **Example 1: Strong Positive Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Multiple abstracts show that pp242 **inhibits processes that worsen Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease**.\n     Inhibition of these processes significantly **improves Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** in various contexts.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     Since pp242 inhibits harmful processes, and inhibition of these processes improves Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, there is strong, consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The interactions are consistent and beneficial.\n     **Assigned Score:** **+2**\n\n\u2022 **Example 2: Likely Positive Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Some abstracts suggest that pp242 **may activate beneficial pathways affecting Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease**.\n     Activation of these pathways might improve Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but evidence is limited or not robust.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     There is evidence indicating potential beneficial interaction, but some uncertainty exists due to limited data or minor contradictions.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The hypothesis is likely supported by the evidence.\n     **Assigned Score:** **+1**\n\n\u2022 **Example 3: Neutral Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Abstracts provide insufficient or inconclusive information about the interaction.\n     Evidence might be mixed or does not directly relate to the hypothesis.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     There is not enough evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The evidence is inconclusive.\n     **Assigned Score:** **0**\n\n\u2022 **Example 4: Likely Negative Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Some abstracts indicate that pp242 **activates processes that worsen Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease**.\n     Activation of these processes may worsen Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but evidence is limited or not definitive.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     There is substantial indication that the interaction may be detrimental to the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or exceptions exist.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The hypothesis is likely refuted based on the evidence.\n     **Assigned Score:** **-1**\n\n\u2022 **Example 5: Strong Negative Outcome**\n  - **Hypothesis:** pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n  - **Evidence:**\n     Multiple abstracts consistently show that pp242 **inhibits beneficial processes for Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease**.\n     Inhibition of these processes clearly worsens Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease across various studies.\n     No evidence suggests any interaction aligns with supporting the hypothesis.\n  - **Logical Conclusion:**\n     Since pp242 inhibits beneficial processes, and inhibition of these processes worsens Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the hypothesis is clearly refuted by strong, consistent evidence.\n  - **Scoring:**\n     The interaction does not align with supporting the hypothesis.\n     **Assigned Score:** **-2**\n\nYour goal is to determine the degree of support for the hypothesis:\n\npp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Review each abstract** to understand how Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242 might be interconnected based on the available information.\n2. **Analyze the presence and implications** of the interaction between Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pp242 in the context of the hypothesis.\n3. **Carefully assess whether the interaction is beneficial or detrimental** to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.\n4. **Synthesize the findings from multiple texts**, considering how the pieces fit together to support or refute the hypothesis: pp242 treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease..\n5. **Provide a justification for your scoring decision** based on the analysis. **Explain your reasoning step-by-step** in terms understandable to an undergraduate biochemist.
