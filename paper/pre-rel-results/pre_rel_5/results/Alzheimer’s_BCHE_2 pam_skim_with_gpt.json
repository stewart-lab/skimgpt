E2020, marketed as Aricept, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range. Our experimental structure of the E2020-TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the 'oxyanion hole', but only indirectly via solvent molecules. Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 16275899\nTitle: Selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibition elevates brain acetylcholine, augments learning and lowers Alzheimer beta-amyloid peptide in rodent.\nAbstract: Like acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and is hence a viable therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by a cholinergic deficit. Potent, reversible, and brain-targeted BChE inhibitors (cymserine analogs) were developed based on binding domain structures to help elucidate the role of this enzyme in the central nervous system. In rats, cymserine analogs caused long-term inhibition of brain BChE and elevated extracellular ACh levels, without inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase. In rat brain slices, selective BChE inhibition augmented long-term potentiation. These compounds also improved the cognitive performance (maze navigation) of aged rats. In cultured human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid precursor protein, and secreted beta-amyloid peptide levels were reduced without affecting cell viability. Treatment of transgenic mice that overexpressed human mutant amyloid precursor protein also resulted in lower beta-amyloid peptide brain levels than controls. Selective, reversible inhibition of brain BChE may represent a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, improving cognition and modulating neuropathological markers of the disease.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 37636505\nTitle: New supramolecules of bis(acylhydrazones)-linked bisphenol sulfide for Alzheimer's: targeting cholinesterases by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> approaches.\nAbstract: In current research, two functional components, <i>i.e.</i>, hydrazone and bisphenol sulfide were combined to get useful supramolecules in medicinal chemistry. Herein 25 new 4,4'-thiodiphenol bis-acylhydrazones were synthesized in good to excellent yields. Initially ethyl-2-chloroacetate was reacted with 4,4'-thiodiphenol, which was further reacted with excess hydrazine hydrate to produce 2,2'-((thiobis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))di(acetohydrazide), which was then combined with various aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to get the desired products (hydrazones, 4a-4y). The synthesized supramolecules were characterized by contemporary spectroscopic techniques such as <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The synthetic compound's cholinesterase blocking activity was tested against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes where compounds 4n, and 4h showed excellent inhibitory potential for AChE, while 4b, and 4h, demonstrated most potent inhibition of BChE. The starting compound (SM3) and compounds 4h and SM3 depicted excellent dual inhibitory capabilities for both enzymes. The chemical basis of anticholinesterase activity was investigated using a structure-based molecular docking approach. The biological significance and the ease of synthesis of this class of compounds should be considered in therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease treatments.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 34455970\nTitle: Interaction of Exogenous Butyrylcholinesterase with \u03b2-Amyloid Plaques in 5XFAD/Butyrylcholinesterase-Knockout Mouse Brain.\nAbstract: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyloid models such as the 5XFAD mouse, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is associated with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques and has unique biochemical features which distinguish it from that found in neurons. It has been suggested that BChE associated with A\u03b2 plaques may be involved in the maturation of this structure and thus disease progression. Currently, it is unknown whether BChE bound to A\u03b2 plaques has altered biochemical properties due to a different primary structure or because of the association of this enzyme with A\u03b2 plaques. Also, the source and binding mechanism of this BChE remains unknown. Brain tissue sections from the 5XFAD/BChE-KO mouse were incubated with exogenous sources of BChE and stained for this enzyme's activity. Efforts were made to determine what region of BChE or A\u03b2 may be involved in this association. We found that incubation of 5XFAD/BChE-KO brain tissues with exogenous BChE led to this enzyme becoming associated with A\u03b2 plaques and neurons. In contrast to neuronal BChE, the BChE bound to A\u03b2 plaques had similar biochemical properties to those seen in AD. Mutations to BChE and efforts to block A\u03b2 epitomes failed to prevent this association. The association of BChE with A\u03b2 plaques, and the resultant biochemical changes, suggests that BChE may undergo a conformational change when bound to A\u03b2 plaques but not neurons. The 5XFAD/BChE-KO model is ideally suited to explore the binding mechanism of BChE to A\u03b2 plaques as well as the involvement of BChE in AD pathogenesis.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32250307\nTitle: Interaction between Apolipoprotein E and Butyrylcholinesterase Genes on Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in a Prospective Cohort Study.\nAbstract: An epistatic interaction between the \u025b4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE\u025b4) gene and the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) genes has been previously reported to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these observations were largely from case-control studies with small sample sizes. To examine the interaction between APOE\u025b4 and BCHE-K on: 1) the risk of incident AD and 2) rates of change in brain volumes and cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD in a prospective cohort study. The study sample for survival analysis included 691 Caucasian participants (age at baseline, 58.4\u00b19.9 years; follow-up time,16.9\u00b19.7 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The neuroimaging sample included 302 participants with 1,388 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Cognitive performance was assessed in 703 participants over 4,908 visits. A total of 122 diagnoses (79 AD, 43 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) were identified. Participants with both APOE\u025b4 and BCHE-K variants had a 3.7-fold greater risk of AD (Hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI=1.99-6.89, p\u200a<\u200a0.001) compared to non-carriers of both genes (APOE \u025b4 x BCHE-K interaction p\u200a=\u200a0.025). There was no APOE \u025b4-BCHE-K interaction effect on rate of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. The APOE and BCHE genes interact to influence risk of incident AD/MCI but not rates of brain atrophy and decline in cognitive performance before onset of cognitive impairment. This may suggest the epistatic interaction between APOE \u025b4 and BCHE-K on AD risk is disease stage-dependent.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 16293236\nTitle: Bioscavengers for the protection of humans against organophosphate toxicity.\nAbstract: Current antidotes for organophosphorus compounds (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with carbamates (pyridostigmine bromide), to protect acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from irreversible inhibition by OP compounds, and post-exposure therapy with anti-cholinergic drugs (atropine sulfate) to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and oximes (e.g., 2-PAM chloride) to reactivate OP-inhibited AChE. These antidotes are effective in preventing lethality from OP poisoning, but they do not prevent post-exposure incapacitation, convulsions, seizures, performance decrements, or in many cases permanent brain damage. These symptoms are commonly observed in experimental animals and are likely to occur in humans. The problems intrinsic to these antidotes stimulated attempts to develop a single protective drug, itself devoid of pharmacological effects, which would provide protection against the lethality of OP compounds and prevent post-exposure incapacitation. One approach is the use of enzymes such as cholinesterases (ChEs), beta-esterases in general, as single pretreatment drugs to sequester highly toxic OP anti-ChEs before they reach their physiological targets. This approach turns the irreversible nature of the OP: ChE interaction from disadvantage to an advantage; instead of focusing on OP as an anti-ChE, one can use ChE as an anti-OP. Using this approach, it was shown that administration of fetal bovine serum AChE (FBSAChE) or equine serum butyrylcholinesterase (EqBChE) or human serum BChE (HuBChE) protected the animals from multiple LD50s of a variety of highly toxic OPs without any toxic effects or performance decrements. The bioscavengers that have been explored to date for the detoxification of OPs fall into three categories: (A) those that can catalytically hydrolyze OPs and thus render them non-toxic, such as OP hydrolase and OP anhydrase; (B) those that stoichiometrically bind to OPs, that is, 1 mol of enzyme neutralizes one or 2 mol of OP inactivating both, such as ChEs and related enzymes; and (C) and those generally termed as \"pseudo catalytic\", e.g., a combination of ChE and an oxime pre-treatment such that the catalytic activity of OP-inhibited ChE can rapidly and continuously be restored in the presence of an oxime. Since the biochemical mechanism underlying prophylaxis by exogenous esterases such as ChEs is established and tested in several animal species, including non-human primates, this concept should allow a reliable extrapolation of results from animal experiments to human application. Having being extensively investigated by several groups, plasma derived HuBChE is judged to be the most suitable bioscavenger for its advancement for human use. The program is being developed at the present time for conducting a safety clinical trial in human volunteers. Several other candidate bioscavengers will follow; e.g., recombinant HuBChE expressed in the milk of transgenic goats, pseudo catalytic scavenger(s), e.g., a combination of ChE and oxime, and possibly PON 1 as a catalytic scavenger in the future.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 17192662\nTitle: Bioscavenger for protection from toxicity of organophosphorus compounds.\nAbstract: Current antidotal regimens for organophosphorus compound (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with a spontaneously reactivating AChE inhibitor such as pyridostigmine bromide, and postexposure therapy with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine sulfate and oximes such as 2-PAM chloride (Gray, 1984). Although these antidotal regimens are effective in preventing lethality of animals from OP poisoning, they do not prevent postexposure incapacitation, convulsions, performance deficits, or, in many cases, permanent brain damage (Dunn and Sidell, 1989). These problems stimulated the development of enzyme bioscavengers as a pretreatment to sequester highly toxic OPs before they reach their physiological targets. Several studies over the last two decades have demonstrated that exogenously administered human serum butyrylcholinesterase (Hu BChE) can be used successfully as a safe, efficacious, and single prophylactic treatment to counteract the toxicity of OPs. It also has potential use for first responders (civilians) reacting to terrorist nerve gas release, pesticide overexposure, or succinylcholine-induced apnea. A dose of 200 mg of Hu BChE in humans is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment that can protect from exposure of 2-5 x LD50 of nerve agents (Ashani, 2000).\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31051153\nTitle: Oxidative and histopathological alterations after sub-acute exposure of diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate in mice: Beneficial effect of N\u2011acetylcysteine.\nAbstract: Protective efficacy of N\u2011acetylcysteine (NAC) was assessed against sub-acute diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP) poisoning in mice. Mice were allocated into nine groups of six each: vehicle control; DFP (0.125 LD<sub>50</sub>\u202f\u2248\u202f0.483\u202fmg/kg bwt, s.c.); DFP\u202f+\u202fAtropine (ATR, 10\u202fmg/kg bwt, i.p., 0\u202fmin); DFP\u202f+\u202fPralidoxime (2-PAM, 30\u202fmg/kg bwt, i.m., 0\u202fmin); DFP\u202f+\u202fNAC (150\u202fmg/kg bwt, i.p., -60\u202fmin); DFP\u202f+\u202fATR\u202f+\u202fNAC; DFP\u202f+\u202f2-PAM\u202f+\u202fNAC; DFP\u202f+\u202fATR\u202f+\u202f2-PAM; and DFP\u202f+\u202fATR\u202f+\u202f2-PAM\u202f+\u202fNAC. Animals received various treatments for 21\u202fd daily. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was measured after 7, 14 and 21\u202fd of exposure. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured (brain, liver and kidney) after 21\u202fd of exposure. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and c-fos were also performed. DFP significantly reduced BChE and AChE levels. Diminished GSH, CAT, SOD (brain and liver), GPx, GR, and elevated MDA (Brain) levels were also observed. DFP caused notable histopathology (brain, liver and kidney) and over expression of iNOS, and c-fos proteins (brain). NAC enhanced the protective efficacy of ATR and 2-PAM in most parameters, without any appreciable protection in iNOS and c-fos expression. NAC as an adjunct with ATR and 2-PAM, exhibited marked beneficial effects against sub-acute DFP poisoning, indicating its possible implications in the management of OP poisoning.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33592259\nTitle: Reactivation of organophosphate-inhibited serum butyrylcholinesterase by novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes and traditional oximes.\nAbstract: Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) include nerve agents and insecticides that potently inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an essential enzyme found throughout the nervous system. High exposure levels to OPs lead to seizures, cardiac arrest, and death if left untreated. Oximes are a critical piece to the therapeutic regimen which remove the OP from the inhibited AChE and restore normal cholinergic function. The current oximes 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and obidoxime (OBD) have two drawbacks: lack of broad spectrum protection against multiple OP structures and poor brain penetration to protect against OP central neurotoxicity. An alternative strategy to enhance therapy is reactivation of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). BChE is stoichiometrically inhibited by OPs with no apparent toxic result. Inhibition of BChE in the serum followed by reactivation could create a pseudo-catalytic scavenger allowing numerous regenerations of BChE to detoxify circulating OP molecules before they can reach target AChE. BChE in serum from rats, guinea pigs or humans was screened for the reactivation potential of our novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes, plus 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and OBD (100\u03bcM) in vitro after inhibition by highly relevant surrogates of sarin, VX, and cyclosarin, and also DFP, and the insecticidal active metabolites paraoxon, phorate-oxon, and phorate-oxon sulfoxide. Novel oxime 15 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited rat serum BChE while novel oxime 20 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited human serum BChE. All tested oximes were poor reactivators of OP-inhibited guinea pig serum BChE. The bis-pyridinium oximes were poor BChE reactivators overall. BChE reactivation may be an additional mechanism to attenuate OP toxicity and contribute to therapeutic efficacy.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32278739\nTitle: Proline 285 is integral for the reactivation of organophosphate-inhibited human butyrylcholinesterase by 2-PAM.\nAbstract: Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is a stoichiometric bioscavenger that protects from the toxicity of nerve agents. Non-human primates are suitable models for toxicity studies that cannot be performed in humans. We evaluated the biochemical properties of native macaque (MaBChE) tetramers, compared to recombinant MaBChE monomers, PEGylated recombinant MaBChE tetramers and monomers, and native HuBChE tetramers. K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values for butyrylthiocholine were independent of subunit assembly status. The K<sub>m</sub> for all forms of MaBChE was about 70\u00a0\u03bcM, compared to 13\u00a0\u03bcM for HuBChE. The k<sub>cat</sub> was about 100,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for MaBChE and 30,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for HuBChE. The reversible inhibitor ethopropazine had similar K<sub>i</sub> values of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcM for all MaBChE forms and HuBChE. The bimolecular rate constant, ki, for inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog of sarin, was 2.2 to 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> for all MaBChE forms and for HuBChE. A major difference between MaBChE and HuBChE was the rate of reactivation by 2-PAM. The second order rate constant for reactivation of DFP-inhibited MaBChE by 2-PAM was 1.4\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>, but was 380 fold faster for DFP-inhibited HuBChE (k<sub>r</sub> 531\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>). The acyl pocket of MaBChE has Leu285 in place of Pro285 in HuBChE. The reactivation rate of DFP-inhibited HuBChE mutant P285L by 2-PAM was reduced 5.8-fold (k<sub>r</sub> 92\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) indicating that P285 determines whether 2-PAM binds in an orientation that favors release of diisopropylphosphate. DFP-inhibited MaBChE treated with 0.2\u00a0M 2-PAM recovered 10% of its original activity, whereas DFP-inhibited HuBChE recovered 80% activity. It was concluded that the biochemical properties of MaBChE are similar to those of HuBChE except for the reactivation of DFP-inhibited BChE.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between Alzheimer\u2019s and 2 pam through their own interactions with BCHE.

However, the existing information suggests that 2-PAM's mechanism of action is counterproductive to the therapeutic strategies employed in AD.\n\n**Analysis of Abstracts:**\n\n1. **PMID: 1494302**\n\n   - **Context:** Heptylphysostigmine (HPTL), an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, is under investigation for AD treatment. Inhibition of AChE increases acetylcholine (ACh) levels, alleviating AD symptoms.\n   - **Key Findings:** DDVP-induced AChE inhibition can be reversed by 2-PAM, but HPTL-induced inhibition cannot. Importantly, inhibited brain AChE does not recover with 2-PAM, unlike red blood cell (RBC) AChE.\n   - **Implication:** 2-PAM reactivates AChE, opposing the desired inhibitory effect in AD therapy. Therefore, 2-PAM would reduce ACh levels, potentially worsening AD symptoms.\n\n2. **PMID: 23916150**\n\n   - **Context:** Neutral oximes that inhibit AChE are explored as potential AD treatments due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and sustain higher ACh levels.\n   - **Key Findings:** 2-PAM is less efficient than certain neutral oximes in reactivating AChE inhibited by organophosphates. The study emphasizes neutral oximes as potential AD drugs because they inhibit AChE, whereas 2-PAM acts as an AChE reactivator.\n   - **Implication:** 2-PAM's role in reactivating AChE contradicts the therapeutic goal in AD of inhibiting AChE to increase ACh levels.\n\n3. **Other Abstracts (PMIDs: 21731462, 26165232, 22647259)**\n\n   - **Relevance:** These abstracts discuss methods of measuring AChE activity and the effects of various inhibitors and reactivators, including 2-PAM, but do not establish a therapeutic role for 2-PAM in AD.\n   - **Implication:** There is no evidence from these abstracts to suggest that 2-PAM treats AD.\n\n**Logical Reasoning:**\n\n- **Directionality of Interaction:** 2-PAM reactivates AChE, leading to decreased ACh levels.\n- **Therapeutic Goal in AD:** Increase ACh levels by inhibiting AChE to improve cognitive function.\n- **Conclusion:** 2-PAM's action is detrimental to the therapeutic goal in AD, as it would lower ACh levels and potentially exacerbate AD symptoms.\n\n**Contradictory Evidence:**\n\n- None of the provided abstracts suggest that 2-PAM benefits AD patients; instead, the evidence implies that 2-PAM's pharmacological action contradicts the desired effect in AD therapy.\n\n**Scoring Justification:**\n\nAccording to the scoring guidelines:\n\n- **Score of -1:** The hypothesis is likely refuted based on the evidence. There is moderate indication that the interaction between Alzheimer's and 2-PAM contradicts the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or contradictory evidence exists.\n\nGiven that the abstracts indicate 2-PAM reactivates AChE (decreasing ACh levels), which is counter to the therapeutic approach in AD (inhibiting AChE to increase ACh levels), the hypothesis that \"2-PAM treats Alzheimer's\" is likely refuted."

These experiments were done in order to determine whether indoxylacetate could be an adequate chromogenic reactant for AChE assay evaluation. Moreover, the results were compared to the standard Ellman's method. We calculated Michaelis constant Km (2.06 \u00d7 10(-4) mol/L for acetylthiocholine and 3.21 \u00d7 10(-3) mol/L for indoxylacetate) maximum reaction velocity V(max) (4.97 \u00d7 10(-7) kat for acetylcholine and 7.71 \u00d7 10(-8) kat for indoxylacetate) for electric eel AChE. In a second part, inhibition values were plotted for paraoxon, and reactivation efficacy was measured for some standard oxime reactivators: obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM) and HI-6. Though indoxylacetate is split with lower turnover rate, this compound appears as a very attractive reactant since it does not show any chemical reactivity with oxime antidots and thiol used for the Ellman's method. Thus it can be advantageously used for accurate measurement of AChE activity. Suitability of assay for butyrylcholinesterase activity assessment is also discussed.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 1494302\nTitle: Inhibition of human brain and RBC acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by heptylphysostigmine (HPTL).\nAbstract: Heptylphysostigmine (HPTL), a derivative of the AChE inhibitor physostigmine (PHY), is under investigation as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease. HPTL is active against human RBC AChE both in vitro and in vivo. Activity of HPTL against human brain has not been documented. We have developed an in vitro assay system using particulate membrane fractions which permits comparison of inhibition and recovery kinetics of human RBC (primarily globular dimer) and brain (primarily globular tetramer) membrane-bound forms. Under these conditions the HPTLIC50 is similar for the two forms. RBC AChE inhibition spontaneously reverses in 24 h, as occurs in vivo. In striking contrast, activity of inhibited brain enzyme does not recover on overnight incubation. DDVP-induced inhibition, but not HPTL inhibition, can be reversed by the oxime 2-PAM. Some recovery of HPTL inhibition, but not to the level seen with RBC AChE, occurs on addition of heat-stable fractions from serum or CSF. Brain enzyme recovers rapidly from PHY in this system. Responses of brain and RBC AChE to HPTL indicate that these forms are functionally as well as structurally distinct. Since brain inhibition apparently does not spontaneously reverse like RBC inhibition, peripheral measurements of patient responses should be assessed with caution during treatment with HPTL.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26165232\nTitle: A fluorescence assay for measuring acetylcholinesterase activity in rat blood and a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y).\nAbstract: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme responsible for metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and inhibition of AChE can have therapeutic applications (e.g., drugs for Alzheimer's disease) or neurotoxic consequences (e.g., pesticides). A common absorbance-based AChE activity assay that uses 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) can have limited sensitivity and be prone to interference. Therefore, an alternative assay was developed, in which AChE activity was determined by measuring fluorescence of resorufin produced from coupled enzyme reactions involving acetylcholine and Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine). The Amplex Red assay was used for two separate applications. First, AChE activity was measured in rat whole blood, which is a biomarker for exposure to AChE inhibitor pesticides. Activity was quantified from a 10(5)-fold dilution of whole blood, and there was a linear correlation between Amplex Red and DTNB assays. For the second application, Amplex Red assay was used to measure AChE inhibition potency in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), which is important for assessing pharmacological and toxicological potential of AChE inhibitors including drugs, phytochemicals, and pesticides. Five known reversible inhibitors were evaluated (IC50, 7-225 nM), along with irreversible inhibitors chlorpyrifos-oxon (ki=1.01 nM(-1)h(-1)) and paraoxon (ki=0.16 nM(-1)h(-1)). Lastly, in addition to inhibition, AChE reactivation was measured in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM). The Amplex Red assay is a sensitive, specific, and reliable fluorescence method for measuring AChE activity in both rat whole blood and cultured SH-SY5Y cells.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 22647259\nTitle: Additive microglia-mediated neuronal injury caused by amyloid-\u03b2 and bacterial TLR agonists in murine neuron-microglia co-cultures quantified by an automated image analysis using cognition network technology.\nAbstract: Activated microglia is considered to be involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of amyloid-\u03b2(1-40) (A\u03b2(40) and exogenous agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 (Pam(3)CSK(4)) and TLR4 (LPS) on neurons in primary murine neuron-microglia co-cultures. Neuronal viability, assessed by quantifying the number of intact neuronal extensions and their crossings using a newly developed Definiens Cognition Network Technology-based method, was significantly decreased after treatment with Pam(3)CSK(4), LPS, and A\u03b2(40). Combined treatment with A\u03b2(40) and Pam(3)CSK(4) or LPS had an additive effect. Hence, in patients with AD, synergistic microglial activation by A\u03b2 and bacterial products during infections might contribute to disease progression.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 23916150\nTitle: NMR determination of Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase inhibition and reactivation by neutral oximes.\nAbstract: Neurotoxic organophosphorus compounds (OPs), which are used as pesticides and chemical warfare agents lead to more than 700,000 intoxications worldwide every year. The main target of OPs is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme necessary for the control of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The control of ACh function is performed by its hydrolysis with AChE, a process that can be completely interrupted by inhibition of the enzyme by phosphylation with OPs. Compounds used for reactivation of the phosphylated AChE are cationic oximes, which usually possess low membrane and hematoencephalic barrier permeation. Neutral oximes possess a better capacity for hematoencephalic barrier permeation. NMR spectroscopy is a very confident method for monitoring the inhibition and reactivation of enzymes, different from the Ellman test, which is the common method for evaluation of inhibition and reactivation of AChE. In this work (1)H NMR was used to test the effect of neutral oximes on inhibition of AChE and reactivation of AChE inhibited with ethyl-paraoxon. The results confirmed that NMR is a very efficient method for monitoring the action of AChE, showing that neutral oximes, which display a significant AChE inhibition activity, are potential drugs for Alzheimer disease. The NMR method showed that a neutral oxime, previously indicated by the Ellman test as better in vitro reactivator of AChE inhibited with paraoxon than pralidoxime (2-PAM), was much less efficient than 2-PAM, confirming that NMR is a better method than the Ellman test.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: 2 pam treats Alzheimer\u2019s., which posits an interaction between Alzheimer\u2019s and 2 pam.
