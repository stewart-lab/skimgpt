Title: Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 (Aricept): implications for the design of new anti-Alzheimer drugs.
Abstract: Several cholinesterase inhibitors are either being utilized for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease or are in advanced clinical trials. E2020, marketed as Aricept, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range. Our experimental structure of the E2020-TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the 'oxyanion hole', but only indirectly via solvent molecules. Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.

Title: Green Extraction of <i>Hodgsonia heteroclita</i> Oilseed Cake Powder to Obtain Optimal Antioxidants and Health Benefits.
Abstract: Most biowaste produced by domestic food preparation and food processing has no value, is difficult to manage, and is detrimental to the environment. Oil extraction from <i>Hodgsonia heteroclita</i> seeds produces large amounts of oilseed cake powder (OCP) as biowaste. The extraction of residual phytochemicals using simple and eco-friendly methods can increase the economic utility of OCP. This study optimized the extraction process for <i>Hodgsonia heteroclita</i> OCP using a Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. The optimized extraction condition was 30 °C for 5 h in 50% (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) ethanol, giving a total phenolic content (TPC) of 414.23 mg of gallic acid equivalent/100 g dry weight (DW). Phytochemical profiles of OCP using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ECI-MS/MS) identified 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and ferulic acid as the major compounds. Antioxidant activities and enzyme inhibitory activities toward the major enzymes involved in obesity (lipase), diabetes (α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV)), Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and β-secretase-1 (BACE-1)), hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE), and genotoxicity were also investigated. Results showed that <i>H. heteroclita</i> OCP possessed antioxidant activity and potential inhibitory activities against BACE-1 and ACE, while also being genome-safe. A simple extraction method for <i>H. heteroclita</i> OCP was developed, demonstrating the enhanced value of its phytochemical and health-promoting qualities.

Title: Selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibition elevates brain acetylcholine, augments learning and lowers Alzheimer beta-amyloid peptide in rodent.
Abstract: Like acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and is hence a viable therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by a cholinergic deficit. Potent, reversible, and brain-targeted BChE inhibitors (cymserine analogs) were developed based on binding domain structures to help elucidate the role of this enzyme in the central nervous system. In rats, cymserine analogs caused long-term inhibition of brain BChE and elevated extracellular ACh levels, without inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase. In rat brain slices, selective BChE inhibition augmented long-term potentiation. These compounds also improved the cognitive performance (maze navigation) of aged rats. In cultured human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid precursor protein, and secreted beta-amyloid peptide levels were reduced without affecting cell viability. Treatment of transgenic mice that overexpressed human mutant amyloid precursor protein also resulted in lower beta-amyloid peptide brain levels than controls. Selective, reversible inhibition of brain BChE may represent a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, improving cognition and modulating neuropathological markers of the disease.

Title: Rivastigmine-Bambuterol Hybrids as Selective Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitors.
Abstract: Selective butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors are considered promising drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In this work, one rivastigmine-bambuterol hybrid (MTR-1) and fourteen of its analogues were synthesized, purified, and characterized. In vitro cholinesterase assays showed that all the compounds were more potent inhibitors of BChE when compared to AChE. Further investigations indicated that MTR-3 (IC<sub>50(AChE)</sub> > 100,000 nM, IC<sub>50(BChE)</sub> = 78 nM) was the best compound in the series, showing high butyrylcholinesterase selectivity and inhibition potency, the potential to permeate the blood-brain barrier, and longer-lasting BChE inhibition than bambuterol. These compounds could be used to discover novel specific BChE inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Title: Changes in acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase in Alzheimer's disease resemble embryonic development--a study of molecular forms.
Abstract: The pattern of molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, EC 3.1.1.8) separated by density gradient centrifugation was investigated in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease (AD), in human embryonic brain and in rat brain after experimental cholinergic deafferentation of the cerebral cortex. While a selective loss of the AChE G4 form was a rather constant finding in AD, a small but significant increase of G1 for both AChE and BChE was found in the most severely affected cases. Both in normal human brain and in AD a significant relationship could be established between the AChE G4/G1 ratio in different brain regions and the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). A similar decrease of the AChE G4 form as observed in AD can be induced in rat by experimental cholinergic deafferentation of the cerebral cortex. The increase in G1 of both AChE and BChE in different brain regions in AD is quantitatively related to the local density of neuritic plaques which are histochemically reactive for both enzymes. In human embryonic brain, a high abundance of G1 and a low G4/G1 ratio for both AChE and BChE was found resembling the pattern observed in AD. Furthermore, both in embryonic brain and in AD AChE shows no substrate inhibition which is a constant feature of the enzyme in the adult human brain. It is, therefore, concluded that the degeneration of the cholinergic cortical afferentation in AD as reflected by a decrease of AChE G4 is accompanied by the process of a neuritic sprouting response involved in plaque formation which is probably associated with the expression of a developmental form of the enzyme.

Title: Assessment of acetylcholinesterase activity using indoxylacetate and comparison with the standard Ellman's method.
Abstract: Assay of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity plays an important role in diagnostic, detection of pesticides and nerve agents, in vitro characterization of toxins and drugs including potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease. These experiments were done in order to determine whether indoxylacetate could be an adequate chromogenic reactant for AChE assay evaluation. Moreover, the results were compared to the standard Ellman's method. We calculated Michaelis constant Km (2.06 × 10(-4) mol/L for acetylthiocholine and 3.21 × 10(-3) mol/L for indoxylacetate) maximum reaction velocity V(max) (4.97 × 10(-7) kat for acetylcholine and 7.71 × 10(-8) kat for indoxylacetate) for electric eel AChE. In a second part, inhibition values were plotted for paraoxon, and reactivation efficacy was measured for some standard oxime reactivators: obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM) and HI-6. Though indoxylacetate is split with lower turnover rate, this compound appears as a very attractive reactant since it does not show any chemical reactivity with oxime antidots and thiol used for the Ellman's method. Thus it can be advantageously used for accurate measurement of AChE activity. Suitability of assay for butyrylcholinesterase activity assessment is also discussed.

Title: A fluorescence assay for measuring acetylcholinesterase activity in rat blood and a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y).
Abstract: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme responsible for metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and inhibition of AChE can have therapeutic applications (e.g., drugs for Alzheimer's disease) or neurotoxic consequences (e.g., pesticides). A common absorbance-based AChE activity assay that uses 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) can have limited sensitivity and be prone to interference. Therefore, an alternative assay was developed, in which AChE activity was determined by measuring fluorescence of resorufin produced from coupled enzyme reactions involving acetylcholine and Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine). The Amplex Red assay was used for two separate applications. First, AChE activity was measured in rat whole blood, which is a biomarker for exposure to AChE inhibitor pesticides. Activity was quantified from a 10(5)-fold dilution of whole blood, and there was a linear correlation between Amplex Red and DTNB assays. For the second application, Amplex Red assay was used to measure AChE inhibition potency in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), which is important for assessing pharmacological and toxicological potential of AChE inhibitors including drugs, phytochemicals, and pesticides. Five known reversible inhibitors were evaluated (IC50, 7-225 nM), along with irreversible inhibitors chlorpyrifos-oxon (ki=1.01 nM(-1)h(-1)) and paraoxon (ki=0.16 nM(-1)h(-1)). Lastly, in addition to inhibition, AChE reactivation was measured in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM). The Amplex Red assay is a sensitive, specific, and reliable fluorescence method for measuring AChE activity in both rat whole blood and cultured SH-SY5Y cells.

Title: Inhibition of human brain and RBC acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by heptylphysostigmine (HPTL).
Abstract: Heptylphysostigmine (HPTL), a derivative of the AChE inhibitor physostigmine (PHY), is under investigation as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease. HPTL is active against human RBC AChE both in vitro and in vivo. Activity of HPTL against human brain has not been documented. We have developed an in vitro assay system using particulate membrane fractions which permits comparison of inhibition and recovery kinetics of human RBC (primarily globular dimer) and brain (primarily globular tetramer) membrane-bound forms. Under these conditions the HPTLIC50 is similar for the two forms. RBC AChE inhibition spontaneously reverses in 24 h, as occurs in vivo. In striking contrast, activity of inhibited brain enzyme does not recover on overnight incubation. DDVP-induced inhibition, but not HPTL inhibition, can be reversed by the oxime 2-PAM. Some recovery of HPTL inhibition, but not to the level seen with RBC AChE, occurs on addition of heat-stable fractions from serum or CSF. Brain enzyme recovers rapidly from PHY in this system. Responses of brain and RBC AChE to HPTL indicate that these forms are functionally as well as structurally distinct. Since brain inhibition apparently does not spontaneously reverse like RBC inhibition, peripheral measurements of patient responses should be assessed with caution during treatment with HPTL.

Title: Additive microglia-mediated neuronal injury caused by amyloid-β and bacterial TLR agonists in murine neuron-microglia co-cultures quantified by an automated image analysis using cognition network technology.
Abstract: Activated microglia is considered to be involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of amyloid-β(1-40) (Aβ(40) and exogenous agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 (Pam(3)CSK(4)) and TLR4 (LPS) on neurons in primary murine neuron-microglia co-cultures. Neuronal viability, assessed by quantifying the number of intact neuronal extensions and their crossings using a newly developed Definiens Cognition Network Technology-based method, was significantly decreased after treatment with Pam(3)CSK(4), LPS, and Aβ(40). Combined treatment with Aβ(40) and Pam(3)CSK(4) or LPS had an additive effect. Hence, in patients with AD, synergistic microglial activation by Aβ and bacterial products during infections might contribute to disease progression.

Title: Bioscavengers for the protection of humans against organophosphate toxicity.
Abstract: Current antidotes for organophosphorus compounds (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with carbamates (pyridostigmine bromide), to protect acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from irreversible inhibition by OP compounds, and post-exposure therapy with anti-cholinergic drugs (atropine sulfate) to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and oximes (e.g., 2-PAM chloride) to reactivate OP-inhibited AChE. These antidotes are effective in preventing lethality from OP poisoning, but they do not prevent post-exposure incapacitation, convulsions, seizures, performance decrements, or in many cases permanent brain damage. These symptoms are commonly observed in experimental animals and are likely to occur in humans. The problems intrinsic to these antidotes stimulated attempts to develop a single protective drug, itself devoid of pharmacological effects, which would provide protection against the lethality of OP compounds and prevent post-exposure incapacitation. One approach is the use of enzymes such as cholinesterases (ChEs), beta-esterases in general, as single pretreatment drugs to sequester highly toxic OP anti-ChEs before they reach their physiological targets. This approach turns the irreversible nature of the OP: ChE interaction from disadvantage to an advantage; instead of focusing on OP as an anti-ChE, one can use ChE as an anti-OP. Using this approach, it was shown that administration of fetal bovine serum AChE (FBSAChE) or equine serum butyrylcholinesterase (EqBChE) or human serum BChE (HuBChE) protected the animals from multiple LD50s of a variety of highly toxic OPs without any toxic effects or performance decrements. The bioscavengers that have been explored to date for the detoxification of OPs fall into three categories: (A) those that can catalytically hydrolyze OPs and thus render them non-toxic, such as OP hydrolase and OP anhydrase; (B) those that stoichiometrically bind to OPs, that is, 1 mol of enzyme neutralizes one or 2 mol of OP inactivating both, such as ChEs and related enzymes; and (C) and those generally termed as ""pseudo catalytic"", e.g., a combination of ChE and an oxime pre-treatment such that the catalytic activity of OP-inhibited ChE can rapidly and continuously be restored in the presence of an oxime. Since the biochemical mechanism underlying prophylaxis by exogenous esterases such as ChEs is established and tested in several animal species, including non-human primates, this concept should allow a reliable extrapolation of results from animal experiments to human application. Having being extensively investigated by several groups, plasma derived HuBChE is judged to be the most suitable bioscavenger for its advancement for human use. The program is being developed at the present time for conducting a safety clinical trial in human volunteers. Several other candidate bioscavengers will follow; e.g., recombinant HuBChE expressed in the milk of transgenic goats, pseudo catalytic scavenger(s), e.g., a combination of ChE and oxime, and possibly PON 1 as a catalytic scavenger in the future.

Title: Reactivation of organophosphate-inhibited serum butyrylcholinesterase by novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes and traditional oximes.
Abstract: Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) include nerve agents and insecticides that potently inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an essential enzyme found throughout the nervous system. High exposure levels to OPs lead to seizures, cardiac arrest, and death if left untreated. Oximes are a critical piece to the therapeutic regimen which remove the OP from the inhibited AChE and restore normal cholinergic function. The current oximes 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and obidoxime (OBD) have two drawbacks: lack of broad spectrum protection against multiple OP structures and poor brain penetration to protect against OP central neurotoxicity. An alternative strategy to enhance therapy is reactivation of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). BChE is stoichiometrically inhibited by OPs with no apparent toxic result. Inhibition of BChE in the serum followed by reactivation could create a pseudo-catalytic scavenger allowing numerous regenerations of BChE to detoxify circulating OP molecules before they can reach target AChE. BChE in serum from rats, guinea pigs or humans was screened for the reactivation potential of our novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes, plus 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and OBD (100μM) in vitro after inhibition by highly relevant surrogates of sarin, VX, and cyclosarin, and also DFP, and the insecticidal active metabolites paraoxon, phorate-oxon, and phorate-oxon sulfoxide. Novel oxime 15 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited rat serum BChE while novel oxime 20 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited human serum BChE. All tested oximes were poor reactivators of OP-inhibited guinea pig serum BChE. The bis-pyridinium oximes were poor BChE reactivators overall. BChE reactivation may be an additional mechanism to attenuate OP toxicity and contribute to therapeutic efficacy.

Title: Bioscavenger for protection from toxicity of organophosphorus compounds.
Abstract: Current antidotal regimens for organophosphorus compound (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with a spontaneously reactivating AChE inhibitor such as pyridostigmine bromide, and postexposure therapy with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine sulfate and oximes such as 2-PAM chloride (Gray, 1984). Although these antidotal regimens are effective in preventing lethality of animals from OP poisoning, they do not prevent postexposure incapacitation, convulsions, performance deficits, or, in many cases, permanent brain damage (Dunn and Sidell, 1989). These problems stimulated the development of enzyme bioscavengers as a pretreatment to sequester highly toxic OPs before they reach their physiological targets. Several studies over the last two decades have demonstrated that exogenously administered human serum butyrylcholinesterase (Hu BChE) can be used successfully as a safe, efficacious, and single prophylactic treatment to counteract the toxicity of OPs. It also has potential use for first responders (civilians) reacting to terrorist nerve gas release, pesticide overexposure, or succinylcholine-induced apnea. A dose of 200 mg of Hu BChE in humans is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment that can protect from exposure of 2-5 x LD50 of nerve agents (Ashani, 2000).

Title: Enantioseparation, in vitro testing, and structural characterization of triple-binding reactivators of organophosphate-inhibited cholinesterases.
Abstract: The enantiomers of racemic 2-hydroxyimino-N-(azidophenylpropyl)acetamide-derived triple-binding oxime reactivators were separated, and tested for inhibition and reactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibited with tabun (GA), cyclosarin (GF), sarin (GB), and VX. Both enzymes showed the greatest affinity toward the methylimidazole derivative (III) of 2-hydroxyimino-N-(azidophenylpropyl)acetamide (I). The crystal structure was determined for the complex of oxime III within human BChE, confirming that all three binding groups interacted with active site residues. In the case of BChE inhibited by GF, oximes I (kr = 207 M-1 min-1) and III (kr = 213 M-1 min-1) showed better reactivation efficiency than the reference oxime 2-PAM. Finally, the key mechanistic steps in the reactivation of GF-inhibited BChE with oxime III were modeled using the PM7R6 method, stressing the importance of proton transfer from Nε of His438 to Oγ of Ser203 for achieving successful reactivation.

Title: Nonquaternary reactivators for organophosphate-inhibited cholinesterases.
Abstract: A new class of amidine-oxime reactivators of organophosphate (OP)-inhibited cholinesterases (ChE) was synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo. Compared with 2-PAM, the most promising cyclic amidine-oxime (i.e., 12e) showed comparable or greater reactivation of OP-inactivated AChE and OP-inactivated BChE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a nonquaternary oxime that has, comparable to 2-PAM, in vitro potency for reactivation of Sarin (GB)-inhibited AChE and BChE. Amidine-oximes were tested in vitro, and reactivation rates for OP-inactivated butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were greater than those for 2-PAM or MINA. Amidine-oxime reactivation rates for OP-inactivated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were lower compared to 2-PAM but greater compared with MINA. Amidine-oximes were tested in vivo for protection against the toxicity of nerve agent model compounds. (i.e., a model of Sarin). Post-treatment (i.e., 5 min after OP exposure, i.p,) with amidine oximes 7a-c and 12a, 12c, 12e, 12f, and 15b (145 μmol/kg, i.p.) protected 100% of the mice challenged with the sarin model compound. Even at 25% of the initial dose of amidine-oxime (i.e., a dose of 36 μmol/kg, i.p.), 7b and 12e protected 100% of the animals challenged with the sarin nerve agent model compound that caused lethality in 6/11 animals without amidine-oxime.
