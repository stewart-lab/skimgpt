                "Score: **0** Points - Reasoning:\n\nAfter reviewing all the provided abstracts, there is no evidence supporting the hypothesis that **stavudine treats diabetes through its effect on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Definition of AHR in the Abstracts**:\n   - In all abstracts provided, \"aHR\" stands for **adjusted hazard ratio**, a statistical term used in Cox proportional hazards models. It is not referring to the **aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)**, which is the receptor involved in many biochemical pathways, including those related to drug metabolism and possibly diabetes.\n\n2. **Interactions Between Stavudine and Diabetes**:\n   - **Abstract PMID 22089377** reports that exposure to stavudine is associated with an **increased incidence of diabetes** among HIV-infected patients. This suggests that stavudine may **worsen** diabetes rather than treat it.\n   - **Abstract PMID 38070936** indicates that prior exposure to a stavudine-containing regimen is independently associated with **lipodystrophy**, a condition linked to insulin resistance and increased risk of diabetes.\n\n3. **Interactions Between Stavudine and AHR**:\n   - None of the abstracts mention any interaction between **stavudine and AHR** (aryl hydrocarbon receptor). The term \"aHR\" in these texts refers to adjusted hazard ratios, not the receptor.\n   - Without evidence of stavudine affecting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, we cannot assess whether it influences diabetes through this pathway.\n\n4. **Interactions Between Diabetes and AHR**:\n   - Similarly, none of the abstracts provide information on interactions between **diabetes and AHR** (aryl hydrocarbon receptor).\n   - There is no evidence suggesting that modulation of AHR affects diabetes in the context of these studies.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Evidence**:\n   - The evidence from the abstracts indicates that stavudine might **increase the risk of diabetes**, which contradicts the idea that it treats diabetes. However, since there's **no evidence** linking stavudine's effect on **AHR** to diabetes treatment in these abstracts, we cannot confirm or refute the hypothesis.\n   - The lack of information on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in relation to both diabetes and stavudine means that the **key mechanism proposed in the hypothesis is not addressed**.\n\n6. **Assigning the Score According to the Guidelines**:\n   - According to the scoring guidelines:\n     - **0**: The hypothesis is **neither supported nor refuted** by the provided texts. The evidence regarding the interactions between diabetes-AHR and AHR-stavudine is **inconclusive, mixed, lacks sufficient detail, or there is a lack of evidence**.\n   - Since there is **no evidence** of interactions involving AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), and the available data does not support the hypothesis, the appropriate score is **0**.\n\n**Therefore, the hypothesis is neither supported nor refuted by the provided abstracts due to a lack of relevant evidence connecting stavudine, diabetes, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).**"

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. This prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan. We prospectively identified adult patients (aged \u226518 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data. The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission. The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation. Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51-72), 171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%) patients had obesity. As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy. The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6). In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1\u00b731 [1\u00b709-1\u00b757] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1\u00b776 [1\u00b708-2\u00b786]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2\u00b794 [1\u00b748-5\u00b784]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1\u00b711 [95%CI 1\u00b702-1\u00b720] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1\u00b710 [1\u00b701-1\u00b719] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.

We evaluated the relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men of all ages with prostate cancer. We conducted an observational study of 37,443 population-based men who were diagnosed with local or regional prostate cancer in the Veterans Healthcare Administration from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2004, with follow-up through December 31, 2005. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess whether androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, oral antiandrogens, the combination of the two (ie, combined androgen blockade), or orchiectomy was associated with diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or stroke, after adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. Overall, 14,597 (39%) of the 37,443 patients were treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Treatment with GnRH agonists was associated with statistically significantly increased risks of incident diabetes (for GnRH agonist therapy, 159.4 events per 1000 person-years vs 87.5 events for no androgen deprivation therapy, difference = 71.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 71.6 to 72.2; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.38), incident coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.28), myocardial infarction (12.8 events per 1000 person-years for GnRH agonist therapy vs 7.3 for no androgen deprivation therapy, difference = 5.5, 95% CI = 5.4 to 5.6; aHR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.52), sudden cardiac death (aHR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.54), and stroke (aHR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.36). Combined androgen blockade was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.53), and orchiectomy was associated with coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.87) and myocardial infarction (aHR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.27 to 3.50). Oral antiandrogen monotherapy was not associated with any outcome studied. Androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH agonists was associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36817596\nTitle: Influenza vaccination trend and related factors among patients with diabetes in Korea: Analysis using a nationwide database.\nAbstract: Subjects with diabetes are at higher risk of serious influenza-related complications. We aimed to investigate the yearly trend of influenza vaccination and factors associated with being unvaccinated for influenza in subjects with diabetes using a nationwide observational study performed within the recent decade. Among 105,732 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2019, 8,632 with diabetes were included. We investigated the yearly trend of influenza vaccination and factors associated with being unvaccinated for influenza. During the study period, the prevalence of influenza vaccination in subjects with diabetes showed a tendency to increase every year, reaching almost 60% in 2019, which was higher than the rate in subjects without diabetes. Younger age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95% CI] 11.29 [8.63-14.75] for < 50 years; 6.16 [5.21-7.29] for 50-65 years), male (aHR 1.67 [1.52-1.87]), current smoker (aHR 1.31 [1.00-1.72], lower-income status (aHR 1.46 [1.17, 1.84]), and high education level (aHR 1.30 [1.01-1.67]) were associated with being unvaccinated. Also, a poorer glycemic control with HbA1c \u2265 9% was found to be correlated with unvaccinated status (aHR 1.48 [1.15-1.90]). The influenza vaccination rate is still unsatisfactory in subjects with diabetes. Young age, males, low-income level, high education level, and poor glycemic control were associated with unvaccinated status. Considering the risk-benefits of influenza vaccination in patients with diabetes, physicians should make an effort to increase vaccination rates, especially in low vaccination rate groups.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36260549\nTitle: Examining the relationship between metformin dose and cancer survival: A SEER-Medicare analysis.\nAbstract: Cancer is a major health problem in the U.S and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is known to increase the risk for the development of many cancers. Metformin, a first-line therapy for treating T2DM, is increasingly being used for its anticancer effects; however, the literature is limited on the effect of metformin dose on overall survival in patients with stage IV cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to the last known follow-up or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive on December 31, 2016 were censored. In this cohort study we examined the relationship between metformin dose and overall survival in persons with both T2DM and stage IV lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreas cancers. We used a retrospective study design with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 2007-2016 of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER) dataset. Of the 7,725 patients, 2,981(38.5%) had been prescribed metformin. Patients who used metformin had significantly better overall survival in both unadjusted (Unadjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76; p < 0.001) and adjusted models (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.81; p < 0.001). The overall survival between patients who took metformin with average daily dose \u2265 1000mg or < 1000mg were not statistically significant (aHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.08; p = 0.90). Metformin use regardless of dose is associated with increased overall survival in older adults with stage IV cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32541383\nTitle: Individual-Level and Clinic-Level Factors Associated With Achieving Glycemic Control in a Large Cohort of People With HIV in Care-Washington, DC.\nAbstract: Optimal management of noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), is crucially important as people with HIV (PWH) live longer with antiretroviral therapy. Our objective was to assess patient-level and clinic-level factors associated with achieving hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) \u22647.0% among PWH and DM. The DC Cohort, an observational clinical cohort of PWH, followed from 2011 to 2019 at 12 sites in Washington, DC. Among PWH with diagnosed DM and elevated HbA1c (>7.0%), we examined the association between achieving HbA1c \u22647.0% and demographic and clinical factors, including time-updated medication data, and clinic-level factors related to services and structure. A multilevel marginal extended Cox regression model was generated to identify factors associated with time to HbA1c \u22647.0%. Over half (52.3%) of 419 participants achieved HbA1c \u22647.0%. Individual-level factors associated with HbA1c \u22647.0% included a diagnosis of DM after enrollment and a longer time since HIV diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.65 and 1.13, P < 0.05 for both]. Attending a clinic with an endocrinologist was associated with the outcome [adjusted HR (aHR) = 1.41 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.01 to 1.97)]. In addition, comparing clinics that treat everyone, refer everyone or have a mix of treating and referring, showed an association between attending a clinic that treats everyone [aHR = 1.52 95% CI: (1.21 to 1.90)] or a clinic that refers everyone [aHR = 2.24 95% CI: (1.63 to 3.07)] compared with clinics with a mix in achieving glycemic control. Multiple factors are associated with achieving glycemic control in an urban cohort of PWH. Determining if specific services or structures improve DM outcomes may improve health outcomes for PWH and DM.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 22089377\nTitle: Ten-year diabetes incidence in 1046 HIV-infected patients started on a combination antiretroviral treatment.\nAbstract: To evaluate the incidence and determinants of diabetes in a cohort of HIV-infected adults initiated with combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) in 1997-1999 and followed up to 2009. Prospective study of 1046 patients at 47 French clinical sites. Potential determinants of diabetes occurrence, defined by confirmed increased glycemia and/or initiation of antidiabetic treatment, were assessed by a proportional hazards model, including time-updated metabolic parameters and ART exposure. Among the cohort, representing 7846 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 54% received indinavir, 75% stavudine and 52% didanosine. Overall, 111 patients developed diabetes, with an incidence of 14.1/1000 PYFU (14.6 in men, 12.6 in women). Incidence peaked in 1999-2000 (23.2/1000 PYFU) and decreased thereafter. The incidence of diabetes was associated [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), all P<0.02] with older age (hazard ratio = 2.13 when 40-49 years, hazard ratio = 3.63 when \u226550 years), overweight (hazard ratio = 1.91 for a BMI 25-29 kg/m(2), hazard ratio = 2.85 >30 kg/m(2)), waist-to-hip ratio (hazard ratio = 3.87 for \u22650.97 male/0.92 female), time-updated lipoatrophy (hazard ratio = 2.14) and short-term exposure to indinavir (0-1 year: hazard ratio = 2.53), stavudine (0-1 year: hazard ratio = 2.56, 1-2 years: hazard ratio = 2.65) or didanosine (2-3 years: hazard ratio = 3.16). Occurrence of diabetes was not associated with HIV-related markers, hepatitis C, hypertension or family history of diabetes. Insulin resistance was predictive for incident diabetes. In this nationwide cohort, followed for 10 years after cART initiation, diabetes incidence peaked in 1990-2000, was markedly higher than that reported for European uninfected or other HIV-infected populations (4-6/1000 PYFU) and linked with age and adiposity. Adiposity and glycemic markers should be monitored in aging HIV-infected patients.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 21483703\nTitle: Four-year treatment outcomes of adult patients enrolled in Mozambique's rapidly expanding antiretroviral therapy program.\nAbstract: In Mozambique during 2004-2007 numbers of adult patients (\u226515 years old) enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) increased about 16-fold, from <5,000 to 79,500. All ART patients were eligible for co-trimoxazole. ART program outcomes, and determinants of outcomes, have not yet been reported. In a retrospective cohort study, we investigated rates of mortality, attrition (death, loss to follow-up, or treatment cessation), immunologic treatment failure, and regimen-switch, as well as determinants of selected outcomes, among a nationally representative sample of 2,596 adults initiating ART during 2004-2007. At ART initiation, median age of patients was 34 and 62% were female. Malnutrition and advanced disease were common; 18% of patients weighed <45 kilograms, and 15% were WHO stage IV. Median baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was 153/\u00b5L and was lower for males than females (139/\u00b5L vs. 159/\u00b5L, p<0.01). Stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine or efavirenz were prescribed to 88% of patients; only 31% were prescribed co-trimoxazole. Mortality and attrition rates were 3.4 deaths and 19.8 attritions per 100 patient-years overall, and 12.9 deaths and 57.2 attritions per 100 patient-years in the first 90 days. Predictors of attrition included male sex [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-1.8], weight <45 kg (AHR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9, reference group >60 kg), WHO stage IV (AHR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4, reference group WHO stage I/II), lack of co-trimoxazole prescription (AHR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), and later calendar year of ART initiation (AHR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8). Rates of immunologic treatment failure and regimen-switch were 14.0 and 0.6 events per 100-patient years, respectively. ART initiation at earlier disease stages and scale-up of co-trimoxazole among ART patients could improve outcomes. Research to determine reasons for low regimen-switch rates and increasing rates of attrition during program expansion is needed.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30700732\nTitle: Treatment effects of the differential first-line antiretroviral regimens among HIV/HBV coinfected patients in southwest China: an observational study.\nAbstract: HIV with HBV co-infection can result in greater HIV-related immunosuppression, morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are few studies to evaluate direct treatment effects on mortality and attrition rates between first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) based-on tenofovir (TDF) and/or lamivudine (3TC) in a real-world setting. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate direct treatment effects of the first-line ART containing stavudine (d4T), azidothymidine (AZT) and TDF on death and attrition among HIV patients with HBV coinfection. A total of 3912 patients met study eligibility criteria. The overall mortality rate and attrition rate was 2.85 (95% CI: 2.55-3.16) and 8.87 (95% CI: 8.32-9.41) per 100 person-years, respectively. The ART containing TDF had a significantly lower risk of death [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)\u2009=\u20090.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.77] when compared to the ART containing d4T, but the risk of death was not significantly different when compared to the ART containing AZT (AHR\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI: 0.69-1.20). Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection receiving the ART containing TDF had significantly lower risk rates of attrition compared to those receiving the ART containing d4T (AHR\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86) or AZT (AHR\u2009=\u20090.67, 95% CI: 0.58-0.77). Compared with the ART containing d4T, the ART containing AZT was significant and not significant associated with a lower risk of death and attrition, respectively. The ART containing TDF had significant effects on both of death and attrition among HIV patients with HBV coinfection.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33995787\nTitle: Predictors of adverse drug reaction among adult HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in government hospitals of Kaffa Zone, Ethiopia; November 2018: a retrospective cohort.\nAbstract: incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADR) associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) was higher in developing countries. In two teaching hospital in Ethiopia: Debremarkose 23% and Yirgalem 73.2% of study participants reported at least one ADR. Since there was limited information about ADR in the study area; we aimed to determine its incidence-rate and predictors. we conducted retrospective cohort study using medical records of HIV-infected patients enrolled on ART between 2006 and 2017 in government hospitals of Ethiopia. ADR was defined as report of at least one unwanted response to ART. We run descriptive and cox regression analysis (CRA). incidence-rate of ADR was 4.1 per 100 person-years (py). Hazards of ADR among patients living at rural was almost two times than at urban; [Adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.94(95% (CI): 1.18, 3.20)]. Stavudine (D4T)-Lamivudine (3TC)-Nevirapine (NVP) had about two times [AHR: 1.78(95%CI: 1.03, 3.08)], Zidovudine(AZT)-3TC-NVP had about two times [AHR: 2.34 (95%CI: 1.20, 4.57)], D4T-3TC-Efaviranze(EFV) had about three times [AHR: 2.86(95%CI: 1.38, 5.95)] and AZT-3TC-EFV had about two times [AHR: 2.16(95%CI: 1.21,3.90)] hazards of ADR than Tenofovir(TDF) based regimens. Being WHO clinical stage III had about two times hazard of ADR [AHR: 2.46 (95%CI: 1.22, 4.95)] and IV had about four times hazard of ADR [AHR: 4.32 (95%CI: 1.88, 9.93)] than stage I. risk of ADR was higher among adult HIV-infected patients on ART living in rural, WHO clinical stage III and IV, and patients on AZT and D4T based regimen. AZT should not be given as an alternative treatment, increase access of TDF regimens.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 38070936\nTitle: Prevalence and risk factors of metabolic syndrome in Ethiopia: describing an emerging outbreak in HIV clinics of the sub-Saharan Africa - a cross-sectional study.\nAbstract: HIV-induced chronic inflammation, immune activation and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are linked with adverse metabolic changes known to cause cardiovascular adversities. This study evaluates the prevalence of lipodystrophy, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and analyses risk factors in HIV-infected Ethiopians taking cART. A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted at tertiary-level hospitals. Eligible participants attending the HIV clinics were enrolled. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical, HIV treatment variables, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose level, risk factors and components of MetS, also lipodystrophy, were studied. Data were analysed by SPSS statistical package V.25 with descriptive and analytical statistics. For multivariable analysis of risk factors, a logistic regression model was used. Results were presented in frequency and percentages, mean\u00b1SD, or median+IQR. Statistical significance was taken as p<0.05. Among 518 studied participants, two-thirds were females, and the mean age of the study population was 45 years (SD=11). The mean duration of cART was 10 years (SD=4). Median CD4 count was 460 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The prevalence of MetS according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (2005) criteria was 37.6%. In multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for MetS were age >45 years (aHR 1.8, 95%\u2009CI 1.2 to 2.4), female sex (aHR 1.8, 95%\u2009CI 1.1 to 2.8), body mass index (BMI)<u>></u>25\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> (aHR 2.7, 95%\u2009CI 1.8 to 4.1), efavirenz-based cART (aHR 2.8, 95%\u2009CI 1.6 to 4.8) and lopinavir/ritonavir-based cART (aHR 3.7, 95%\u2009CI 1.0 to 13.3). The prevalence of lipodystrophy was 23.6%. Prior exposure to a stavudine-containing regimen was independently associated with lipodystrophy (aHR 3.1, 95%\u2009CI 1.6 to 6.1). Our study revealed 38% of the participants had MetS indicating considerable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. Independent risk factors for MetS were BMI\u226525\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup>, efavirenz and lopinavir/ritonavir-based cART, female sex and age \u226545 years. In addition to prevention, CVD risk stratification and management will reduce morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between diabetes and stavudine through their own interactions with AHR. Use only the provided abstracts from PubMed, each containing only two of the three terms at a time (diabetes + AHR, or AHR + stavudine), to inform your analysis.\n\nYour evaluation should:\n\n- **Integrate evidence from all abstracts** to discern how diabetes, AHR, and stavudine might be interconnected.\n\n- **Assess the directionality and nature of each interaction** (e.g., activation, inhibition, reactivation) to determine whether it **aligns with** or **contradicts** the hypothesis.\n\n- **Identify and analyze any opposing mechanisms** where one interaction may negate the effects of another.\n\n- **Employ logical reasoning**, drawing logical inferences where appropriate, based on diabetes-AHR and AHR-stavudine interactions.\n\n- **Assess the nature and directionality of the interactions**, determining whether they are beneficial or detrimental to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.\n\n- **Be vigilant for any evidence that contradicts or challenges the hypothesis**, explicitly addressing any contradictions in your reasoning.\n\n- **Avoid inferring effects not supported by the texts**, ensuring that all conclusions are grounded in the provided information.\n\n- **Ensure that your scoring reflects an unbiased assessment based solely on the provided evidence**, considering logical inferences from indirect evidence.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Example 1: Strong Positive Outcome**\n\n  -

                "Score: **-2 Points**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the provided abstracts, the consistent evidence indicates that **stavudine is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes**, rather than treating it. The interaction between stavudine and diabetes is detrimental, directly contradicting the hypothesis that \"stavudine treats diabetes.\"\n\n1. **Abstract 1 (PMID: 10929917):** This abstract discusses mitochondrial toxicity induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including stavudine. It highlights that **NRTIs can inhibit mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma**, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular toxicity. Clinical manifestations resembling inherited mitochondrial diseases, such as lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, are mentioned. Importantly, **diabetes is listed as a less common adverse effect potentially related to mitochondrial dysfunction** caused by NRTIs. This suggests that stavudine may contribute to the development of diabetes due to its mitochondrial toxicity.\n\n2. **Abstract 2 (PMID: 18268071):** This large cohort study investigates the incidence of diabetes among HIV-infected patients. It finds that the **incidence of diabetes increases with cumulative exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)**. Crucially, **stavudine exposure shows the strongest association with new-onset diabetes**, even after adjusting for known risk factors. The study suggests that stavudine may **directly contribute to insulin resistance, potentially through mitochondrial toxicity**. This provides strong evidence that stavudine increases the risk of diabetes.\n\n3. **Abstract 3 (PMID: 32920318):** In this cross-sectional study of HIV-infected adolescents, **longer exposure to stavudine is associated with lipoatrophy**. While insulin resistance and prediabetes/diabetes are highest among those with lipohypertrophy, the study indicates that **metabolic complications, including abnormal glucose metabolism, are common in patients with lipodystrophy**, a condition linked to stavudine use. This suggests an indirect relationship where stavudine contributes to metabolic disturbances associated with diabetes.\n\n4. **Abstract 4 (PMID: 30720846):** This study focuses on cardiovascular risk factors among people living with HIV. It finds that those on **stavudine-containing regimens are more likely to have raised total cholesterol levels**, contributing to increased cardiovascular risk. While diabetes is not directly addressed, the findings underscore the **detrimental metabolic effects associated with stavudine**, which can be tied to insulin resistance and diabetes development.\n\n5. **Abstract 5 (PMID: 31304808):** This review highlights that efficient antiretroviral therapy allows control of HIV but notes a high prevalence of metabolic diseases among persons living with HIV (PLWH). It specifically states that **first-generation NRTIs like stavudine are associated with lipodystrophy, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, and diabetes**. The incidence of diabetes was high with ART regimens that included stavudine, indicating that stavudine use is linked to the onset of diabetes.\n\n**Logical Conclusion:**\n\nAcross all abstracts, **there is consistent evidence that stavudine increases the risk of developing diabetes** through mechanisms involving mitochondrial toxicity, lipodystrophy, and metabolic disturbances affecting lipid and glucose metabolism. **No evidence suggests that stavudine treats or improves diabetes**; instead, the interaction is consistently detrimental.\n\n**Scoring Justification:**\n\nAccording to the **Scoring Guidelines**, a score of **-2** is appropriate when \"the hypothesis is refuted by consistent evidence indicating that the interaction between diabetes and stavudine contradicts the proposed outcome.\" The provided abstracts offer strong, consistent evidence that stavudine **increases the risk of diabetes**, refuting the hypothesis that \"stavudine treats diabetes.\" The interaction between stavudine and diabetes is detrimental, with no significant contradictory evidence to suggest a beneficial effect.\n\n**Therefore, the assigned score is -2.**"

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 10929917\nTitle: Pharmacology of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-induced mitochondrial toxicity.\nAbstract: This paper reviews the function of the mitochondria and the mechanisms by which nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause mitochondrial toxicity. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces rates of morbidity and mortality due to HIV disease. However, long-term treatment with these drugs may be associated with adverse effects. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and have become the cornerstone of HAART. Unfortunately, these drugs have also been shown to inhibit cellular polymerases, most notably mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Studies of the NRTIs in enzyme assays and cell cultures demonstrate the following hierarchy of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma inhibition: zalcitabine > didanosine > stavudine > lamivudine > zidovudine > abacavir. In vitro investigations have also documented impairment of the mitochondrial enzymes adenylate kinase and the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate translocator. Inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma and other mitochondrial enzymes can gradually lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular toxicity. The clinical manifestations of NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity resemble those of inherited mitochondrial diseases (ie, hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, myopathy, nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis). Fat redistribution syndrome, or HIV-associated lipodystrophy, is another side effect attributed in part to NRTI therapy. The morphologic and metabolic complications of this syndrome are similar to those of the mitochondrial disorder known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis: suggesting that this too may be related to mitochondrial toxicity. The pathophysiology of less common adverse effects of nucleoside analogue therapy, such as diabetes, ototoxicity, and retinal lesions, may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction but have not been adequately studied. NRTls can block both HIV reverse transcriptase and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Inhibition of the latter enzyme is the most likely cause of the adverse effects associated with these drugs.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 18268071\nTitle: Incidence and risk factors for new-onset diabetes in HIV-infected patients: the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study.\nAbstract: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of diabetes among HIV-infected patients in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) cohort, to identify demographic, HIV-related, and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-related factors associated with the onset of diabetes, and to identify possible mechanisms for any relationships found. D:A:D is a prospective observational study of 33,389 HIV-infected patients; diabetes is a study end point. Poisson regression models were used to assess the relation between diabetes and exposure to cART after adjusting for known risk factors for diabetes, CD4 count, lipids, and lipodystrophy. Over 130,151 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), diabetes was diagnosed in 744 patients (incidence rate of 5.72 per 1,000 PYFU [95% CI 5.31-6.13]). The incidence of diabetes increased with cumulative exposure to cART, an association that remained significant after adjustment for potential risk factors for diabetes. The strongest relationship with diabetes was exposure to stavudine; exposures to zidovudine and didanosine were also associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Time-updated measurements of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were all associated with diabetes. Adjusting for each of these variables separately reduced the relationship between cART and diabetes slightly. Although lipodystrophy was significantly associated with diabetes, adjustment for this did not modify the relationship between cART and diabetes. Stavudine and zidovudine are significantly associated with diabetes after adjustment for risk factors for diabetes and lipids. Adjustment for lipodystrophy did not modify the relationship, suggesting that the two thymidine analogs probably directly contribute to insulin resistance, potentially through mitochondrial toxicity.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32920318\nTitle: Adipocytokine dysregulation, abnormal glucose metabolism, and lipodystrophy in HIV-infected adolescents receiving protease inhibitors.\nAbstract: Lipodystrophy is common in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs), stavudine, and zidovudine. Adipocytokines may be altered in lipodystrophy. We evaluated risk factors, adipocytokine levels, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles in HIV-infected adolescents with different lipodystrophy types. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 80 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents receiving PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy for\u00a0\u2265\u00a06\u00a0months. Patients underwent oral glucose tolerance tests and measurements of high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, resistin, insulin, and lipids. They were classified into 3 groups based on the clinical findings: no lipodystrophy, isolated lipoatrophy, and any lipohypertrophy (isolated lipohypertrophy or combined type). Of the 80 patients (median age, 16.7\u00a0years), 18 (22.5%) had isolated lipoatrophy, while 8 (10%) had any lipohypertrophy (four with isolated lipohypertrophy, and four with the combined type). In a multivariate analysis, longer exposure to stavudine (OR: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and indinavir (OR: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) were associated with lipoatrophy, while longer exposure to didanosine (OR: 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and indinavir (OR: 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045) were associated with any lipohypertrophy. Leptin levels were highest in the any-lipohypertrophy group and lowest in the isolated-lipoatrophy group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). HMW adiponectin levels were significantly lowest in the any-lipohypertrophy group and highest in the no-lipodystrophy group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). There were no significant differences in the levels of resistin among the three groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.234). The prevalence of insulin resistance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and prediabetes/diabetes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significantly highest in the any-lipohypertrophy group. Patients with lipoatrophy and those without lipodystrophy had comparable degrees of insulin resistance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.292). In multiple linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and waist-height ratio, HMW adiponectin levels were associated with Matsuda index (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.5; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a040.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and almost significantly associated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.054). Leptin and resistin levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, Matsuda index, or QUICKI (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Abnormal glucose metabolism and dysregulation of adipocytokines were common in the HIV-infected adolescents with lipohypertrophy and the combined type. Preventive screening for cardiovascular diseases caused by metabolic alterations should be routinely performed.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30720846\nTitle: Cardiovascular risk factors among people living with HIV in rural Kenya: a clinic-based study.\nAbstract: To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and their association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected adults in a rural sub-county hospital in Kenya. This was a descriptive survey of patient charts characterising cardiovascular risk among adult patients (> 18 years) at Ukwala sub-county hospital between June 2013 and January 2015. Post-stratification survey weights were applied to obtain prevalence levels. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for each variable related to cardiovascular risk factors were calculated using logistic regression models. Overall, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 0.4%, 0.3% of patients had had a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), 40.4% had pre-hypertension, while 10.4% had stage 1 and 2.9% stage 2 hypertension. Up to 14% of patients had elevated non-fasting total cholesterol levels. Factors associated with hypertension were male gender (AOR 1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), being over 40 years of age (AOR 1.78, <i>p</i> = 0.0001) and having an increased waist circumference (OR 2.56, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). Raised total cholesterol was more likely in those on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (AOR 2.2, p = 0.0042), azidothymidine (AZT) (AOR 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0004) and stavudine (D4T) -containing regimens (AOR 3.13, <i>p</i> = 0.0002). An elevated prevalence of undiagnosed cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and raised total cholesterol levels was found among people living with HIV. There was an association between raised total cholesterol and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) -based ART regimens. Our findings provide further rationale for integrating routine cardiovascular risk-factor screening into HIV-care services.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31304808\nTitle: Metabolic complications affecting adipose tissue, lipid and glucose metabolism associated with HIV antiretroviral treatment.\nAbstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Efficient antiretroviral-treatment (ART) generally allows control of HIV infection. However, persons-living-with-HIV (PLWH), when aging, present a high prevalence of metabolic diseases. <b>Area covered</b>: Altered adiposity, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, diabetes, and their consequences are prevalent in PLWH and could be partly related to ART. <b>Expert opinion</b>: At first, personal and lifestyle factors are involved in the onset of these complications. The persistence of HIV in tissue reservoirs could synergize with some ART and enhance metabolic disorders. Altered fat repartition, diagnosed as lipodystrophy, has been related to first-generation nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors (NRTIs) (stavudine zidovudine) and some protease inhibitors (PIs). Recently, use of some integrase-inhibitors (INSTI) resulted in weight/fat gain, which represents a worrisome unresolved situation. Lipid parameters were affected by some first-generation NRTIs, non-NRTIs (efavirenz) but also PIs boosted by ritonavir, with increased total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Insulin resistance is common associated with abdominal obesity. Diabetes incidence, high with first-generation-ART (zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine, indinavir) has declined with contemporary ART close to that of the general population. Metabolic syndrome, a dysmetabolic situation with central obesity and insulin resistance, and liver steatosis are common in PLWH and could indirectly result from ART-associated fat gain and insulin resistance. All these dysmetabolic situations increase the atherogenic cardiovascular risk.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: stavudine treats diabetes., which posits an interaction between diabetes and stavudine.
