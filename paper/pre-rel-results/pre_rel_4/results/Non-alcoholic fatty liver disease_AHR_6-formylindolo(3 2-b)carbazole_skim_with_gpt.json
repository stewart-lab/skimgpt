                "Score: 0 Point(s) - Reasoning:\n\nTo evaluate the hypothesis that **6-formylindolo(3 2-b)carbazole (FICZ) treats Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through its effect on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)**, we examine the provided abstracts for evidence of interactions between NAFLD and AHR, and between AHR and FICZ.\n\n**Interactions between NAFLD and AHR:**\n\n1. **Abstract 4 (PMID: 31401392)** reports that **inhibition of AHR alleviates NAFLD** in mice. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF), an effective AHR inhibitor, reduced liver damage by inhibiting AHR and associated pathways. This suggests that **AHR activation may contribute to NAFLD pathogenesis**, and that **AHR inhibition is beneficial** in NAFLD.\n\n2. **Abstract 5 (PMID: 32941865)** indicates that **moderate activation of AHR may facilitate the resolution of inflammation** in obesity-mediated NAFLD by inducing anti-inflammatory mediators like IL-22. This suggests that **AHR activation can also have beneficial effects** in NAFLD.\n\nTherefore, **the role of AHR in NAFLD is complex**, with evidence supporting both detrimental effects of AHR activation (Abstract 4) and beneficial effects of moderate AHR activation (Abstract 5).\n\n**Interactions between AHR and FICZ:**\n\n1. **Abstract 6 (PMID: 18362915)** demonstrates that **FICZ acts as an AHR agonist**, and its activation of AHR **interferes with regulatory T cell development, boosts TH17 cell differentiation, and increases severity of autoimmune encephalomyelitis** in mice. This suggests that **FICZ-induced AHR activation may promote inflammation**.\n\n2. **Abstract 10 (PMID: 33607406)** discusses how **AHR activation by FICZ leads to IL-17 production by Th17 cells**, which is associated with inflammation in diseases such as hidradenitis suppurativa, suggesting a **pro-inflammatory role** of FICZ-induced AHR activation.\n\n3. Conversely, **Abstract 7 (PMID: 21600206)** shows that **AHR activation can up-regulate IL-22 production and inhibit inflammation** in the gastrointestinal tract, indicating that **AHR activation may also have anti-inflammatory effects depending on the cytokines involved**.\n\n**Connecting FICZ, AHR, and NAFLD:**\n\n- There is **no direct evidence** in the provided abstracts that **FICZ treatment affects NAFLD** via AHR.\n- The **effects of AHR activation by FICZ are context-dependent**. In some cases, AHR activation by FICZ **promotes inflammation** (via IL-17), while in others, it **may inhibit inflammation** (via IL-22).\n- Since **NAFLD is associated with inflammation**, the **outcome of AHR activation by FICZ on NAFLD is unclear** based on the provided abstracts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The evidence **does not conclusively support** the hypothesis that **FICZ treats NAFLD through its effect on AHR**.\n- The **interactions are mixed**: AHR inhibition alleviates NAFLD (Abstract 4), but moderate AHR activation may also be protective (Abstract 5).\n- **FICZ activates AHR**, but its effects are context-dependent and **may be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory**.\n- **No abstracts provide direct evidence** of FICZ improving NAFLD via AHR activation.\n\n**According to the scoring guidelines:**\n\n**0:** The hypothesis is **neither supported nor refuted** by the provided texts. The evidence regarding the interactions between NAFLD-AHR and AHR-FICZ is **inconclusive, mixed, and lacks sufficient detail**."

The aim of this study was to assess all-cause and liver-specific mortality in a cohort of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with and without NASH from two historic databases were included. Clinico-demographic information from the time of biopsy was available. Mortality data were obtained from National Death Index-Plus and used for estimating overall and cause-specific mortality. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare cohorts. Two hundred eighty-nine NAFLD patients were included (50.3 \u00b1 14.5 years old, 39.4 % male, 78.6 % Caucasian, 46.0 % obese, 26.0 % diabetic, 5.9 % with family history of liver diseases). Of these, 59.2 % had NASH whereas 40.8 % had non-NASH NAFLD. NASH patients were predominantly female, had higher aspartate aminotranserase, alanine aminotransferase and fasting serum glucose. During follow-up (median 150 months, maximum 342 months), patients with NASH had higher probability of mortality from liver-related causes than non-NASH NAFLD patients (p value = 0.0026). In the entire NAFLD cohort, older age [aHR = 1.07 (95 % CI = 1.05-1.10)] and presence of type II diabetes [aHR = 2.09 (1.39-3.14)] were independent predictors of overall mortality. However, in addition to age [aHR = 1.06 (1.02-1.10)] having histologic NASH [aHR = 9.16 (2.10-9.88)] was found to be an independent predictor of liver-related mortality. Additionally, presence of type II diabetes was associated with liver-related mortality [aHR = 2.19 (1.00-4.81)]. This long-term follow-up of NAFLD patients confirms that NASH patients have higher risk of liver-related mortality than non-NASH. Additionally, patients with NAFLD and type II diabetes are at highest risk for overall and liver-related mortality.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 27166128\nTitle: Statins Reduce the Risk of Cirrhosis and Its Decompensation in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\nAbstract: The protective effect of statins in cirrhosis and its decompensation in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients remains unknown. We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2009. A total of 298,761 CHB patients were identified. CHB patients using statins (n=6,543; defined as \u226528 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD)) and a 1:1 ratio propensity score and inception point (the date of first use of statins)-matched non-statins (<28 cDDD) were followed up from the inception point until the development of cirrhosis or its decompensation or until withdrawal from insurance or December 2009. After adjustment for competing mortality, CHB patients using statins had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cirrhosis (relative risk)=0.433; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.344-0.515; modified log-rank test, P<0.001) and decompensated cirrhosis (relative risk=0.468; 95% CI=0.344-0.637; P<0.001) compared with patients not using statins. After adjustment for age, gender, comorbidity index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, aspirin use, diabetes medication, CHB treatment, non-statin lipid-lowering drugs, and triglyceride lipid-lowering drugs using the Cox proportional hazard model, statins were still an independent protector against cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=0.512; 95% CI=0.413-0.634; P<0.001) and its decompensation (AHR=0.534; 95% CI=0.433-0.659; P<0.001). The AHRs for cirrhosis were 0.467 and 0.200, and the AHRs for decompensated cirrhosis were 0.611 and 0.231 with 91-365 and >365 cDDD of statins, respectively. CHB patients who receive statin therapy have a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of cirrhosis and its decompensation.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32087038\nTitle: The amount of liver fat predicts mortality and development of type 2 diabetes in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAbstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to evaluate whether conventional histological grading of steatosis and accurate quantification of fat content in liver biopsies using stereological point counting (SPC) can predict mortality and future development of T2DM in NAFLD patients. 129 patients with biopsy proven NAFLD, enrolled between 1988 and 1992, were re-evaluated on two occasions, after 13.7 (\u00b11.5) and 23.2 (\u00b16.8) years. In patients accepting to undergo the procedure, repeat liver biopsies were performed on each follow-up and were evaluated with conventional histopathological methodology and SPC. Of the 106 patients without T2DM at baseline, 66 (62%) developed T2DM during a mean follow-up of 23.2 (\u00b1 6.8) years. Steatosis grade and liver fat measured with SPC independently (adjusted for age, BMI, fibrosis stage) predicted development of T2DM with an aHR of 1.60 per grade and 1.03 for each SPC percentage increase respectively. Overall mortality and development of T2DM was more common in patients with grade 3 steatosis compared to lower grades of steatosis. Liver fat measured with SPC was significant for overall mortality (aHR 1.04). In patients that underwent repeat biopsy, reduction in liver fat measured with SPC was associated with decreased risk of developing T2DM (aHR 0.91 for each SPC percentage decrease). Steatosis grade and liver fat measured with SPC predict mortality and the risk of developing T2DM in NAFLD. Reduction in liver fat decreases the risk of developing T2DM.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31401392\nTitle: Alpha-naphthoflavone attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in oleic acid-treated HepG2 hepatocytes and in high fat diet-fed mice.\nAbstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease. The literature suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and it can modulate the synthesis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Previous studies have shown that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme of oxidative stress, TNF-\u03b1 is involved in the formation of insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress and insulin resistance are the key factors for the formation of NAFLD. Therefore, it can be said that AHR may participate in contributing to NAFLD by regulating CYP1A1 and TNF-\u03b1. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is an effective AHR inhibitor. The present study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of ANF in high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. Mice were fed HFD to induce NAFLD, HepG2 cells were exposed to OA to induce hepatocyte injury, and ANF significantly reduced mouse and cellular liver damage compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD and OA-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. ANF treatment reduces liver damage by reducing ROS and IR, the data show that ANF inhibits the expression of AHR, CYP1A1 and TNF-\u03b1 in NAFLD. Taken together, these findings show that ANF alleviate NAFLD via regulation of AHR/CYP1A1 and AHR/TNF-\u03b1 pathways, which may have potential for further development as novel therapeutic agents for NAFLD.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32941865\nTitle: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated inflammation and resolution: Non-genomic and genomic signaling.\nAbstract: Inflammation, an old medical problem, is being recognized as an active, well orchestrated biological process. When dysregulated, chronic inflammation may ensue, leading to tissue-dependent diseases. Depending upon the ligand and cellular context, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may accelerate or attenuate inflammation and subsequent resolution. Three examples are discussed in which AHR modulates inflammation by a mixture of genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways: (i) AHR-agonistic bacterial virulence factors are leading to both microbial defense and resolution of inflammatory responses. (ii) TCDD-mediated persistent AHR activation initially leads to inflammation by non-genomic signaling, and may potentially lead to chronic inflammation. (iii) AHR may modulate anti-inflammatory actions in obesity-mediated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Hepatic lipotoxicity triggers generation of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that facilitate the development of hepatitis. AHR is mainly involved in the resolution phase by induction of lipoxin A4 and Il-22. Moderate AHR activation by phytochemicals and microbial AHR ligands may facilitate resolution. In control of inflammation, AHR appears to integrate environmental conditions with coordinated cellular functions.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 18362915\nTitle: Control of T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.\nAbstract: Regulatory T cells (T(reg)) expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 control the autoreactive components of the immune system. The development of T(reg) cells is reciprocally related to that of pro-inflammatory T cells producing interleukin-17 (T(H)17). Although T(reg) cell dysfunction and/or T(H)17 cell dysregulation are thought to contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders, little is known about the physiological pathways that control the generation of these cell lineages. Here we report the identification of the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a regulator of T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in mice. AHR activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induced functional T(reg) cells that suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, AHR activation by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole interfered with T(reg) cell development, boosted T(H)17 cell differentiation and increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Thus, AHR regulates both T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in a ligand-specific fashion, constituting a unique target for therapeutic immunomodulation.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 21600206\nTitle: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-induced signals up-regulate IL-22 production and inhibit inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.\nAbstract: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is believed to involve an altered balance between effector and regulatory T cells. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the toxicity of dioxins, controls T-cell responses. We investigated the role of AhR in inflammation and pathogenesis of IBD in humans and mouse models. AhR expression was evaluated in intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBD and controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were activated in the presence or absence of the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (Ficz). Colitis was induced in mice using trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), or T-cell transfer. Mice were given injections of Ficz or the AhR antagonist 2-metyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid; some mice first received injections of a blocking antibody against interleukin (IL)-22. Cytokines were quantified by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Intestine tissue from patients with IBD expressed significantly less AhR than controls. In LPMCs from patients with IBD, incubation with Ficz reduced levels of interferon gamma (IFN)-\u03b3 and up-regulated IL-22. Mice injected with Ficz were protected against TNBS-, DSS-, and T-cell transfer-induced colitis; they had marked down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and induction of IL-22. Mice given AhR antagonist produced more inflammatory cytokines and less IL-22 and developed a severe colitis. Neutralization of endogenous IL-22 disrupted the protective effect of Ficz on TNBS-induced colitis. AhR is down-regulated in intestinal tissue of patients with IBD; AhR signaling, via IL-22, inhibits inflammation and colitis in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. AhR-related compounds might be developed to treat patients with IBDs.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33790107\nTitle: The Differential Selectivity of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) Agonists towards AHR-Dependent Suppression of Mammosphere Formation and Gene Transcription in Human Breast Cancer Cells.\nAbstract: We had previously reported that treatment with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist \u03b2-naphthoflavone (\u03b2NF) suppressed mammosphere formation derived from cancer stem cells in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Cancer Lett., 317, 2012, Zhao et al.). Here, using several AHR agonists, we have investigated the association of this suppression with the classical ability to induce AHR-mediated gene transcription in the xenobiotic response element (XRE). The mammosphere formation assays were performed using wild-type and AHR-knockout MCF-7 cells in the presence of AHR agonists including 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), indirubin, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and kynurenine (KYN), followed by the XRE-reporter gene assays of the agonists. We showed that treatments with 3MC, BaP, and DMBA strongly suppressed mammosphere formation of the stem cells in an AHR-dependent manner, while other agonists showed weaker suppression. In reporter gene assays, the strength or duration of AHR/XRE-mediated gene transcription was found to be dependent on the agonist. Although strong transcriptional activation was observed with 3MC, FICZ, indirubin, I3C, IAA, or KYN after 6\u2009h of treatment, only weak activation was seen with BaP or DMBA. While transcriptional activation was sustained or increased at 24\u2009h with 3MC, BaP, or DMBA, appreciable reduction was observed with the other agonists. In conclusions, the results demonstrated that the suppressive effects of AHR agonists on mammosphere formation do not necessarily correlate with their abilities to induce AHR-mediated gene transcription. Hence, different AHR functions may be differentially induced in an agonist-dependent manner.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31606975\nTitle: 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) Enhances The Expression of Tumor Suppressor miRNAs, miR-22, miR-515-5p, and miR-124-3p in MCF-7 Cells.\nAbstract: microRNAs (miRNAs) play bifunctional roles in the initiation and progression of cancer, and recent evidence has confirmed that unusual expression of miRNAs is required for the progress of breast cancer. The regulatory role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its endogenous ligand, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) on the expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs, miR-22, miR-515-5p and miR-124-3p, as well as their association with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) were the aims of this study. In this experimental study, the expression levels of <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p, miR-124-3p</i> and <i>miR-382-5p</i> in MCF-7 cells were determined using the quantificational real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Our results revealed that <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p,</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i> expressions were significantly increased in cells transfected with ER\u03b1 siRNA. Our data also showed that <i>miR-22, miR 515-5p,</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i> expression levels were significantly increased following FICZ treatment. Here, we found that AhR/ER\u03b1 cross-talk plays a critical role in the expression of <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i> in MCF-7 cells. Overall, our data demonstrated that FICZ, as an AhR agonist could induce the expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs, <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p,</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i>; thus, FICZ might be regarded as a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer treatment.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33607406\nTitle: Hidradenitis suppurativa - The role of interleukin-17, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the link to a possible fungal aetiology.\nAbstract: Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent, debilitating skin disease of the hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep-seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillae, inguinal and anogenital regions. The pathophysiology of the disease remains elusive, with newer therapies targeting various aspects of the dysregulated immune system. This presents a useful opportunity to look at the cytokine profile in HS and other inflammatory conditions that share similar patterns with the aim of teasing out less considered explanations for HS pathogenesis. It has been observed that IL-17 appears to be the most common denominator linking HS with other immune mediated diseases like Crohn, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Given that IL-17 plays an important role in antifungal immunity, evidenced by the cytokine pattern in fungal disease and the bulk of data citing their potential involvement in Crohn, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis; it is fair to suggest the need to explore the role that fungi play in the setting of HS going forward. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) is a ubiquitous and largely conserved entity that is gaining interest in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. It is well known to modulate autoimmune states. Its activation by both exogenous and endogenous agents result in secretion of IL-17 by Th17 cells. One of such agents is the tryptophan metabolite 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ)-which can be produced by microorganisms such as fungi. It will be interesting to explore its usefulness in HS pathogenesis.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 6-formylindolo(3 2-b)carbazole through their own interactions with AHR.
