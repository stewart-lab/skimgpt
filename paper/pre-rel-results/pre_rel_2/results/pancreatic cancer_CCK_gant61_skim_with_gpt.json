Interactions between Pancreatic Cancer and CCK:**\n\n- **Pancreatic Cancer Abstracts (PMID: 25889214, 35408691, 36367161, 38058810):** These abstracts discuss various mechanisms and factors involved in pancreatic cancer progression, such as long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, KRAS mutations, and circular RNAs. However, none of these abstracts mention CCK or explore its role in pancreatic cancer.\n\n- **CCK Mentions:** There is no mention of CCK (cholecystokinin) in the context of pancreatic cancer within these abstracts.\n\n**2. Interactions between GANT61 and CCK:**\n\n- **GANT61 Abstracts (PMID: 27894350, 27601167, 30268354, 32677544, 35933378):** These abstracts focus on the effects of GANT61, a GLI inhibitor, in various cancers and diseases such as glioma, medulloblastoma, arthritis, multiple myeloma, and endometriosis. GANT61 is shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and affect signaling pathways like Hedgehog and Notch.\n\n- **CCK-8 Mentions:** In these abstracts, \"CCK-8\" refers to the **Cell Counting Kit-8 assay**, a common method used to assess cell viability and proliferation in research studies. This assay involves a colorimetric detection method and is unrelated to the hormone CCK (cholecystokinin).\n\n- **No Interaction Identified:** There is no mention of GANT61 interacting with CCK, nor is there any discussion of GANT61 affecting CCK levels or activity.\n\n**3. Clarification on CCK-8 Assay vs. CCK Hormone:**\n\n- **CCK-8 Assay:** The term \"CCK-8\" in the abstracts represents the **Cell Counting Kit-8 assay**. It is important to note that this assay is a laboratory technique and does not involve or measure the hormone CCK.\n\n- **Cholecystokinin (CCK):** CCK is a digestive hormone involved in stimulating the digestion of fat and protein. It is not connected to the cell viability assay mentioned in the abstracts.\n\n**4. Logical Inferences and Assessment:**\n\n- **Lack of Evidence for Interactions:** Since the abstracts do not provide information on interactions between pancreatic cancer and CCK, or between GANT61 and CCK, we cannot infer any pathway or mechanism by which GANT61 could treat pancreatic cancer through an effect on CCK.\n\n- **No Contradictory Evidence:** There is also no evidence contradicting the hypothesis within the provided abstracts.\n\n**5. Conclusion Based on Scoring Guidelines:**\n\n- According to the scoring guidelines:\n\n  - **0 Points:** The hypothesis is **neither supported nor refuted** by the provided texts. The evidence regarding the interactions between pancreatic cancer-CCK and CCK-GANT61 is inconclusive, mixed, lacks sufficient detail, or there is a lack of evidence.\n\n- **Assigned Score:** **0 Points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The provided abstracts do not offer evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.\n\n- There is **no information** on CCK (cholecystokinin) interacting with either pancreatic cancer or GANT61.\n\n- Mentions of \"CCK-8\" refer to a cell viability assay, **not** the hormone CCK.\n\n- Therefore, the necessary connections to assess the hypothesis are absent, and the evidence is **inconclusive**."

However, their biological functions, molecular mechanisms, and the prognostic value associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a fundamental role for the lncRNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) in the progression and chemoresistance of PDAC. High-throughput microarrays were performed to detect the expression profiles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs in eight human PDAC tissues and four pancreatic tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the levels of HOTTIP and HOXA13 transcripts in PDAC cell lines and 90 PDAC samples from patients. HPDE6 cells (immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells) and corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were used as controls, respectively. The functions of HOTTIP and HOXA13 in cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were evaluated by targeted knockdown in vitro. CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, and xenografts in nude mice were used to investigate whether targeted silencing of HOTTIP could sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the relationship between HOXA13 expression and patient outcome. Microarray analyses revealed that HOTTIP was one of the most significantly upregulated lncRNAs in PDAC tissues compared with pancreatic tissues. Quantitative PCR further verified that HOTTIP levels were increased in PDAC cell lines and patient samples compared with controls. Functionally, HOTTIP silencing resulted in proliferation arrest by altering cell-cycle progression, and impaired cell invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, inhibition of HOTTIP potentiated the antitumor effects of gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of HOXA13 by RNA interference (siHOXA13) revealed that HOTTIP promoted PDAC cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance, at least partly through regulating HOXA13. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that higher HOXA13 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis, poor histological differentiation, and decreased overall survival in PDAC patients. As a crucial tumor promoter, HOTTIP promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance by modulating HOXA13. Therefore, the HOTTIP/HOXA13 axis is a potential therapeutic target and molecular biomarker for PDAC.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 28697764\nTitle: Long non-coding RNA linc00673 regulated non-small cell lung cancer proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition by sponging miR-150-5p.\nAbstract: The function of a new long non-coding RNA linc00673 remains unclear. While identified as an oncogenic player in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), linc00673 was found to be anti-oncogenic in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However whether linc00673 regulated malignancy and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has not been characterized. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch assays and transwell invasion assays. Epithelial mesenchymal transition was examined using western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Interaction between miRNA and linc00673 was determined using luciferase reporter assays. In vivo experiments were performed to assess tumor formation. In addition, the expression data of NSCLC specimens of TCGA and patient survival data were utilized to explore the prognostic significance of linc00673. In the present study, we found high linc00673 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. In vitro experiments showed linc00673 knockdown reversed TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT, and miR-150-5p was predicted to target linc00673 through bioinformatics tools. Overexpression of miR-150-5p suppressed lin00673's expression while inhibition of miR-150-5p led to significant upregulation of lin00673, suggesting that linc00673 could be negatively regulated by miR-150-5p, which was further confirmed by the inverse correlation between linc00673 and miR-150-5p in NSCLC patients' specimen. Furthermore, we proved that miR-150-5p could directly target linc00673 through luciferase assay, so linc00673 could sponge miR-150-5p and modulate the expression of a key EMT regulator ZEB1 indirectly. In addition, miR-150-5p inhibition abrogated linc00673 silence mediated proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT suppressing effect. Moreover, the inhibition of linc00673 significantly attenuated the tumorigenesis ability of A549 cells in vivo. We validated linc00673 as a novel oncogenic lncRNA and demonstrated the molecular mechanism by which it promotes NSCLC, which will advance our understanding of its clinical significance.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 35408691\nTitle: Rutin Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Cell Apoptosis by Upregulating miRNA-877-3p Expression.\nAbstract: (1) Background: pancreatic cancer is one of the most serious cancers due to its rapid and inevitable fatality, which has been proved very difficult to treat, compared with many other common cancers. Thus, developing an effective therapeutic strategy, especially searching for potential drugs, is the focus of current research. The exact mechanism of rutin in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. (2) Method: three pancreatic cancer cell lines were used to study the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of rutin. The potent anti-proliferative, anti-migration and pro-apoptotic properties of rutin were uncovered by cell viability, a wound-healing migration assay, and a cell apoptosis assay. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to detect the change of miRNAs expression. Immunoblotting analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptotic proteins. (3) Results: CCK-8 and EDU assays revealed that rutin significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cells\u2019 proliferation (p < 0.05). A wound-healing assay showed that rutin significantly suppressed pancreatic cancer cells\u2019 migration (p < 0.05). A flow cytometric assay showed that rutin could promote pancreatic cancer cells\u2019 apoptosis. Intriguingly, rutin significantly upregulated miR-877-3p expression to repress the transcription of Bcl-2 and to induce pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis. Accordingly, rutin and miR-877-3p mimics could promote apoptotic protein expression. (4) Conclusions: our findings indicate that rutin plays an important role in anti-pancreatic cancer effects through a rutin-miR-877-3p-Bcl-2 axis and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 36367161\nTitle: Wild\u2011type KRAS inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer through the Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin pathway.\nAbstract: Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation is considered to be the event that leads to the initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the mutation frequency of the KRAS gene in PDAC is 90\u201195%. Studies have shown that wild\u2011type KRAS (KRAS<sup>WT</sup>) has a survival advantage in PDAC and can antagonize the effect of mutated KRAS G12D (KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>), leading to a low cell transformation efficiency. The present study focused on the differences in biological behavior between KRAS<sup>WT</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and explored the mechanism in pancreatic cancer. Overexpressed KRAS<sup>WT</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> was transfected into cells through lentiviral transfection. The differences and mechanisms were explored using cell counting kit\u20118 (CCK\u20118), clone formation, wound healing and Transwell assays, as well as western blotting, immunohistochemistry and tumor formation in nude mice. <i>In\u00a0vitro</i>, the proliferation of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was reduced compared with PANC\u20111 group, while the proliferation of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group was not significantly changed. <i>In\u00a0vivo</i>, the proliferation of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was reduced and that of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group was enhanced compared with that in the PANC\u20111 group. The invasion and migration of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group were decreased, while the invasion and migration of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group were increased. Western blotting showed that the expression of E\u2011cadherin, \u03b1\u2011E\u2011catenin, MMP\u20113, MMP\u20119, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was increased, while no significant difference was observed in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group. The results of immunohistochemistry were consistent with those of western blotting. KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group can inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>, while KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group can significantly promote proliferation <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>, but not significantly in\u00a0vitro. Wild\u2011type KRAS may inhibit the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer through the Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin pathway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 38058810\nTitle: <i>CircATP13A1</i> (hsa_circ_0000919) promotes cell proliferation and metastasis and inhibits cell apoptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via the <i>miR-186/miR-326/HMGA2</i> axis: implications for novel therapeutic targets.\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a notoriously aggressive malignancy with a survival rate of merely 9%. The prognosis in patients with PDAC is relatively poor, particularly in patients with advanced distant metastases. However, the mechanisms of PDAC progression remain elusive. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been implicated in the development of various malignancies, including PDAC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how a novel circRNA, <i>circATP13A1</i>, regulates PDAC progression. We used the GEO database to determine <i>circATP13A1</i> expression levels in cancer and adjacent cells and employed the limma package of R software to identify differentially expressed circRNAs. We detected the expression of <i>circATP13A1</i>, <i>miR-186</i>, and <i>miR-326</i> using qRT-PCR and investigated the effect of <i>circATP13A1</i> on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis <i>in vitro</i> using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), the transwell migration assay, and the flow cytometry assay. We then performed RNA pull-down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Western blot to verify the interaction between <i>circATP13A1</i>, <i>miR-186</i>, <i>miR-326</i>, and <i>HMGA2</i>. Moreover, we used a naked mice model to determine how <i>circATP13A1</i> affects tumor growth and progression <i>in vivo</i>. Loss and gain of function analyses revealed that <i>circATP13A1</i> upregulation promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, which results in PDAC progression and poor prognosis in patients. <i>CircATP13A1</i> knockdown significantly impaired cell proliferation and migration of PDAC cell lines. Additionally, <i>circATP13A1</i> knockdown significantly increased the expression of <i>miR-186</i> and <i>miR-326</i>, while reducing the expression of <i>HMGA2</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05), indicating that <i>miR-186</i> and <i>miR-326</i> are downstream targets of <i>circATP13A1</i>. Rescue experiments support the interactions between <i>circATP13A1</i>, <i>miR-186</i>, <i>miR-326</i>, and <i>HMGA2</i>. In conclusion, we demonstrated that <i>circATP13A1</i> sponges the <i>miR-186/miR-326/HMGA2</i>/axis, acting as an oncogene to promote PDAC development.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\nPMID: 27894350\nTitle: GANT61, a GLI inhibitor, sensitizes glioma cells to the temozolomide treatment.\nAbstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of downregulating Hedgehog pathway by GANT61 on human glioma cells, examine the consequent changes of temozolomide (TMZ)-induced effects and explore the molecular mechanisms. The cytotoxicity of a Gli1/2 inhibitor, GANT61 was examined both alone and in combination with TMZ in human glioma cell lines. The mRNA and protein expression alterations were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. CCK-8 assay detected the cell proliferative capability. Apoptotic cell number was measured by flow cytometry. The transwell assay was used to test the cell invasive capability. DNA damage effect was identified by COMET assay and \u03b3H2AX expression. Proliferation of tumor cells treated with GANT61 in combination with TMZ was significantly suppressed compared with those treated with either drug used alone. The combination treatment induced a higher rate of apoptosis, DNA damage and reduced the invasive capability of glioma cells. DNA damage repair enzyme MGMT and the Notch1 pathway increased in the cells treated by TMZ treatment. However, GANT61 could abrogated the protein increasing. GANT61 sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ treatment by enhancing DNA damage effect, decreasing MGMT expression and the Notch1 pathway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 27601167\nTitle: Suppression of GLI sensitizes medulloblastoma cells to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.\nAbstract: The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway plays the important role in medulloblastoma (MB). Altered GLI expression plays a key role in these processes, and the inhibition of GLI may be a good cancer-targeted therapy. This study aimed to investigate whether GANT61, a GLI inhibitor, may inhibit the SHH signalling pathway promoting cell mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and enhance cisplatin apoptosis antineoplastic therapy. In our study, we determined the effect of GANT61-mediated inhibition of GLI in Daoy MB cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations of GANT61 alone or in combination with cisplatin. Cell proliferation was assessed with CCK-8 assays, and cell invasion and migration were performed using 8-\u00b5m transwell inserts. Cell apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometric analysis and rhodamine 123. qPCR was used to complete RNA experiments. Protein expression was assessed with Western blotting. The GANT61 significantly inhibited cell proliferation. GANT61 decreased the cell migration and invasion, impairing these crucial steps in tumour progression. Cell apoptosis was significantly increased in Daoy cells. Rhodamine 123 assay showed that GANT61 could decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential promoting cell mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. GANT61 inhibited the expression of GLI and Bcl-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels and might affect the expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 to promote cell intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, GANT61 could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis to decrease the IC50 value of cisplatin. Finally, data suggest that GANT61 could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis through promoting the expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 protein levels. Our data suggest that the SHH signalling pathway plays an important role in MB. GLI is an oncogenic transcription factor in the SHH pathway, and targeting GLI with GANT61 results in favourable antitumour activity and targeted therapy.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30268354\nTitle: GANT61 alleviates arthritic symptoms by targeting fibroblast-like synoviocytes in CIA rats.\nAbstract: Studies have identified that the fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) exhibited tumor-like characteristics and was the key factor in the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). GANT61, an antagonist of the sonic hedgehog pathway, has been verified with inhibitory effect on many cancers. Here we investigated the effect of GANT61 on FLS and the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 40 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal, CIA, CIA+10\u00a0mg/kg GANT61 and CIA+20\u00a0mg/kg GANT61. CIA was induced in rat with collagen injecting. The GANT61 was administered by intraperitoneal injection every 2 days for 3 weeks. The CIA model was identified with the paw swelling, arthritis score and the pathologic changes in joint. The FLS of different group were primary cultured. The proliferative capacity of FLS was detecteded via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method, and the apoptosis was detecteded by flow cytometry. The Bcl-2, Bax, Caspases3 and cleaved Caspases3 in synovium and FLS were detecteded by Western Blot. The 20\u00a0mg/kg GANT61 treatment reduced the incidence of CIA and relieved the arthritis symptoms in CIA rats. The Bcl-2 was upregulated and the Bax was downregulated in the CIA rats synovium. The 10\u00a0mg/kg and 20\u00a0mg/kg GANT61 diminished the Bcl-2 expression, 20\u00a0mg/kg GANT61 increased the Bax and activated the Caspases3 in the CIA synovium. The proliferation of CIA-FLS was significantly higher and the apoptosis of the CIA-FLS was lower than that of the control group. The 10\u00a0mg/kg and 20\u00a0mg/kg GANT61 treatment can reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by diminishing Bcl-2 and increasing the Bax in CIA-FLS. The GANT61 inhibit the proliferation of FLS and alleviated the arthritic symptoms in CIA rats, this implied the GANT61 may be recommended as a possible candidate for the therapy of RA.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32677544\nTitle: A Gli inhibitor GANT61 suppresses cell proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis and induces G1/G0 cycle retardation with a dose- and time-dependent manner through inhibiting Notch pathway in multiple myeloma.\nAbstract: This study aimed to explore the effect of GANT61 on regulating cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and cell cycle, and to investigate whether GANT61 would function in multiple myeloma (MM) via inhibiting Notch pathway. <b>Methods</b>: RPMI-8226 and U266 cells were treated by GANT61 (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0 \u03bcmol/L) for 18, 24 and 36 hours (h), and cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit 8. Then these cells were treated by GANT61 at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 \u03bcmol/L for 24 h or treated by 10.0 \u03bcmol/L GANT61 for 0, 18, 24 and 36 h, and cell apoptosis rate, apoptosis markers and cell cycle were detected by AV/PI, Western blot, and PI staining. Notch1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Hes1 expressions were detected by qPCR and Western blot. Further rescue experiments were conducted by upregulating Notch1. <b>Results</b>: In RPMI-8226 and U266 cells, GANT61 inhibited cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis rate and cell percentage of G1/G0 phase while decreased cell percentage of S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Besides, GANT61 inhibited Notch1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Hes1 expressions in a dose- and time-dependent manner as well. In rescue experiments, Notch1 upregulation attenuated the inhibition of cell proliferation, promotion of cell apoptosis, induction of G1/G0 cycle retardation and repression of Notch signaling pathway induced by GANT61 treatment in RPMI-8226 and U266 cells. <b>Conclusions</b>: GANT61 suppresses cell proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis and induces G1/G0 cycle retardation with a dose- and time-dependent manner through inhibiting Notch pathway in MM.

However, the pathogenesis of this disease is unclear. Therefore, more studies are needed to elucidate its pathogenesis. Our previous publication found that the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway was activated in endometriosis. This study tested whether SHH signaling in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) was critical for the pathogenesis of endometriosis. To examine the effect of inhibiting the SHH signaling pathway on endometriosis, we first isolated ESCs from eutopic endometrial tissues of patients with or without endometriosis and identified the extracted cells by morphological observation and immunofluorescence. Then, we treated ESCs with the GLI inhibitor GANT61 and used CCK-8, wound healing and invasion assays to detect cell activities, such as proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we detected the expression of key proteins and proliferation markers of the SHH signaling pathway in the lesions of nude mice using immunochemistry. We demonstrated that higher concentrations of GANT61 decreased the proliferation rate and migration distance of ESCs. We observed that GANT61 inhibited the invasion of ESCs. In addition, blockage of the SHH signaling pathway significantly reduced cell proliferation in vitro. Our study suggested that inhibition of the SHH pathway is involved in cell proliferation and invasive growth in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits an interaction between pancreatic cancer and gant61 through their own interactions with CCK.

            "Prompt": "Biomedical Abstracts for Analysis:\nPMID: 19860666\nTitle: Hedgehog target genes: mechanisms of carcinogenesis induced by aberrant hedgehog signaling activation.\nAbstract: Hedgehog signaling is aberrantly activated in glioma, medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and other tumors. Hedgehog signals activate GLI family members via Smoothened. RTK signaling potentiates GLI activity through PI3K-AKT-mediated GSK3 inactivation or RAS-STIL1-mediated SUFU inactivation, while GPCR signaling to Gs represses GLI activity through adenylate cyclase-mediated PKA activation. GLI activators bind to GACCACCCA motif to regulate transcription of GLI1, PTCH1, PTCH2, HHIP1, MYCN, CCND1, CCND2, BCL2, CFLAR, FOXF1, FOXL1, PRDM1 (BLIMP1), JAG2, GREM1, and Follistatin. Hedgehog signals are fine-tuned based on positive feedback loop via GLI1 and negative feedback loop via PTCH1, PTCH2, and HHIP1. Excessive positive feedback or collapsed negative feedback of Hedgehog signaling due to epigenetic or genetic alterations leads to carcinogenesis. Hedgehog signals induce cellular proliferation through upregulation of N-Myc, Cyclin D/E, and FOXM1. Hedgehog signals directly upregulate JAG2, indirectly upregulate mesenchymal BMP4 via FOXF1 or FOXL1, and also upregulate WNT2B and WNT5A. Hedgehog signals induce stem cell markers BMI1, LGR5, CD44 and CD133 based on cross-talk with WNT and/or other signals. Hedgehog signals upregulate BCL2 and CFLAR to promote cellular survival, SNAI1 (Snail), SNAI2 (Slug), ZEB1, ZEB2 (SIP1), TWIST2, and FOXC2 to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and PTHLH (PTHrP) to promote osteolytic bone metastasis. KAAD-cyclopamine, Mu-SSKYQ-cyclopamine, IPI-269609, SANT1, SANT2, CUR61414 and HhAntag are small-molecule inhibitors targeted to Smoothened, GANT58, GANT61 to GLI1 and GLI2, and Robot-nikinin to SHH. Hedgehog signaling inhibitors should be used in combination with RTK inhibitors, GPCR modulators, and/or irradiation for cancer therapy.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 20024066\nTitle: Small-molecule modulators of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway.\nAbstract: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the most widely characterized of the three vertebrate Hedgehog homologs, and is essential for proper embryonic development. Shh binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptch1), resulting in the de-repression of Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the activation of Gli2, which regulates the transcription of target genes that include Gli1 and Ptch1. Several synthetic and naturally occurring small-molecule modulators of Smo have been discovered. Shh-signaling antagonists that bind to Smo include cyclopamine, SANT1, and Cur-61414. Shh signaling agonists that bind to Smo include the synthetic small molecules purmorphamine and SAG. Small molecules that inhibit Shh signaling downstream of Smo, GANT58 and GANT61 have also been reported. Robotnikinin inhibits the Shh pathway by directly targeting Shh. Although progress has been made in understanding and modulating Shh signaling, fundamental aspects of Shh signal transduction remain obscure, including the mechanism(s) whereby Ptch1 regulates Smo activity. Small-molecule modulators of Shh signaling provide a means to regulate the activity of a pathway implicated in medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and developmental disorders. Several Shh inhibitors have not succeeded in the clinic for unknown reasons, but clinical trials in BCC and pancreatic cancer with the promising Smo antagonists GDC-0449 and IPI-926 are currently underway.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 27349387\nTitle: Efficient elimination of pancreatic cancer stem cells by hedgehog/GLI inhibitor GANT61 in combination with mTOR inhibition.\nAbstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. The innovative treatments are required and now the cancer stem cells (CSCs) are expected to be an effective target for novel therapies. Therefore we investigated the significance of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the maintenance of CSC-like properties of pancreatic cancer cells, in order to discover the key molecules controlling their unique properties. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Capan-1\u00a0M9 were used for our experiments in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10\u00a0% fetal bovine serum. Sphere formation assay, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometric analysis and MTT cell viability assay were performed to investigate molecular signals and the efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of the Hh pathway significantly reduced the expression of stem cell marker CD133 and sphere formation, an index of self-renewal capacity, demonstrating the suppression of CSC-like properties. Moreover, the GLI inhibitor GANT61 induced greater reduction in sphere formation and cell viability of pancreatic cancer cells than the smoothened (SMO) inhibitor cyclopamine. This suggests that GLI transcription factors, but not SMO membrane protein, are the key molecules in the Hh pathway. The treatment using GANT61 in combination with the inhibition of mTOR, which is another key molecule in pancreatic CSCs, resulted in the efficient reduction of cell viability and sphere formation of an inhibitor-resistant cell line, showing the strong efficacy and wide range applicability to pancreatic CSC-like cells. Thus, this novel combination treatment could be useful for the control of pancreatic cancer by targeting pancreatic CSCs. This is the first report of the efficient elimination of pancreatic cancer stem-like cells by the double blockage of Hh/GLI and mTOR signaling.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 24297612\nTitle: Inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway induces autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.\nAbstract: The HH signaling pathway is a 'core' signal transduction pathway in pancreatic cancer that promotes the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancers via enhancing cell proliferation, increasing invasion and metastasis and protecting against apoptosis. In the present study, we found that HH signaling regulates autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells. Activation of HH signaling inhibits autophagy, while inhibition of the HH pathway induces autophagy. Although the role of autophagy in cell survival and apoptosis may depend on tumor type and the microenvironment, our data clearly demonstrated that GANT61-induced autophagy contributed to reduced viability and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro, and these effects were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA. We propose that HH signaling by regulating autophagy plays an important role in determining the cellular response to HH-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer and further investigation of the interaction between autophagy and HH signaling is particularly important.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31036756\nTitle: Genomic testing, tumor microenvironment and targeted therapy of Hedgehog-related human cancers.\nAbstract: Hedgehog signals are transduced through Patched receptors to the Smoothened (SMO)-SUFU-GLI and SMO-Gi-RhoA signaling cascades. MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as <i>BCL2, FOXA2, FOXE1, FOXF1, FOXL1, FOXM1, GLI1, HHIP, PTCH1</i> and <i>WNT2B</i>, in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis, immune evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired <i>SMO</i> mutations, <i>SUFU</i> deletions, <i>GLI2</i> amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione B and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing.\n\n===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: gant61 treats pancreatic cancer., which posits an interaction between pancreatic cancer and gant61.
