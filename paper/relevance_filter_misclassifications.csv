"Abstract: Shixiao San (SXS) is a traditional Chinese formula that has been widely used in clinical practice to treat blood stasis syndromes, such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic, thrombosis and coronary heart disease. However, the effectiveness and mechanism of SXS have not been studied in detail yet. Current study aimed to identify the compounds in SXS, evaluate the formula efficacies using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and verify the pharmacological effects by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The compounds in SXS were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF-MS. Potential target genes for identified compounds were obtained from three databases. DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. PPI network was constructed to screen core targets. Molecular docking was used to examine interactions between active compounds and potential targets. The mechanism was also verified by model of acute blood stasis rats and human umbilical vein cells. In total, 45 compounds were identified from SXS. Among the detected phytochemicals, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, D-catechin, naringenin and amentoflavone were identified as the active constituents. SXS is primarily involved in the modulation of hypoxic state, vascular regulation, and inflammation response, according to GO and KGG pathway enrichment analysis. A network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was constructed and five core targets were identified as VEGFA, AKT1, EGFR, PTGS2, and MMP9. Molecular docking simulation revealed good binding affinity of the five putative targets with the corresponding compounds. SXS reduced HIF-1α and COX-2 levels and increased the eNOS expression levels in hypoxic HUVECs. SXS can reduce the whole blood viscosity in adrenaline induced acute blood stasis rats and relieve blood stasis. SXS removes blood stasis might through VEGFA/AKT/eNOS/COX-2 pathway and flavonoids are the main active components in the formula.

"Abstract: Activated microglia is considered to be involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of amyloid-β(1-40) (Aβ(40) and exogenous agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 (Pam(3)CSK(4)) and TLR4 (LPS) on neurons in primary murine neuron-microglia co-cultures. Neuronal viability, assessed by quantifying the number of intact neuronal extensions and their crossings using a newly developed Definiens Cognition Network Technology-based method, was significantly decreased after treatment with Pam(3)CSK(4), LPS, and Aβ(40). Combined treatment with Aβ(40) and Pam(3)CSK(4) or LPS had an additive effect. Hence, in patients with AD, synergistic microglial activation by Aβ and bacterial products during infections might contribute to disease progression.

"Abstract: Diabetic bone disease is a complication of type I and type II diabetes, both of which are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. Increased hip and foot fracture rates do not correlate well with changes in bone mineral density (BMD), whereas studies support the importance of collagen structure to bone strength. Extracellular lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens resulting in aldehydes that subsequently form critically important biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. Although LOX-dependent biosynthetic crosslinks in bone collagen are deficient in diabetic bone, the expression and regulation of bone LOXs in diabetes have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. Moreover, we have identified a novel metabolic regulatory relationship that is dysregulated in diabetes using mouse models. Data indicate that the incretin (gastric hormone) known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that is anabolic to osteoblasts strongly upregulates LOX, and that this regulation is disrupted in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in mice. In vivo and in vitro studies support that diabetes results in elevated circulating peripheral dopamine, likely also derived from the gut, and is responsible for blocking GIP signaling and LOX levels in osteoblasts. Moreover, peripheral administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride to diabetic mice restored trabecular bone structure to near normal and partially reversed downregulation of LOX. Taken together our data identifies a novel metabolic relationship between the gut-derived hormone GIP and bone-derived LOX, and points to the importance of LOX dysregulation in the pathology of diabetic bone disease. © 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Here are the key points that support this relevance:  1. **Direct Reference to Diabetes and LOX**: The abstract explicitly mentions diabetes and its impact on the expression and regulation of the LOX gene in bone tissue. This direct mention establishes a clear connection between the disease and the gene in question.  2. **Role of LOX in Bone Strength**: It is noted that LOX catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens, leading to biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. These crosslinks are crucial for bone strength, and the abstract mentions that these are deficient in diabetic bone, implicating LOX in the pathology of diabetic bone disease.  3. **Experimental Findings on LOX Downregulation in Diabetes**: The study described in the abstract found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. This finding directly links the gene LOX with the pathophysiological changes observed in diabetes, particularly in bone tissue.  4. **Metabolic Regulation of LOX by Diabetes-related Hormones**: The abstract details a novel metabolic regulatory relationship where the incretin hormone GIP upregulates LOX in osteoblasts. It further explains that this regulation is disrupted in diabetes, specifically in a model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin in mice. This disruption contributes to the downregulation of LOX"
"Abstract: Metabolic stress in skeletal muscle cells causes sustained metabolic changes, but the mechanisms of the prolonged effects are not fully known. In this study, we tested C2C12 cells with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulator AICAR and measured the changes in the metabolic pathways and signaling kinases. AICAR caused an acute increase in the phosphorylation of the AMPK target ULK1, the mTORC1 substrate S6K, and the mTORC2 target Akt. Intriguingly, prior exposure to AICAR only decreased glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity when it underwent three-hour recovery after exposure to AICAR in a bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (KHB) instead of Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM). The phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target S6K was increased after recovery in DMEM but not KHB, although this appeared to be specific to S6K, as the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target site on ULK1 was not altered when the cells recovered in DMEM. The phosphorylation of mTORC2 target sites was also heterogenous under these conditions, with Akt increasing at serine 473 while other targets (SGK1 and PKCα) were unaffected. The exposure of cells to rapamycin (an mTORC1 inhibitor) and PP242 (an inhibitor of both mTOR complexes) revealed the differential phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates. Taken together, the data suggest that prior exposure to AICAR causes the selective phosphorylation of mTOR substrates, even after prolonged recovery in a nutrient-replete medium.

"Abstract: Increasing evidence links impaired brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence prompted a search for molecular players common to AD and diabetes mellitus (DM). The work incorporated studies based on a primary care-based cohort (pcb-Cohort) and a bioinformatics analysis to identify central nodes, that are key players in AD and insulin signaling (IS) pathways. The interactome for each of these key proteins was retrieved and network maps were developed for AD and IS. Synaptic enrichment was performed to reveal synaptic common hubs. Cohort analysis showed that individuals with DM exhibited a correlation with poor performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test. Additionally, APOE ɛ2 allele carriers appear to potentially be relatively more protected against both DM and cognitive deficits. Ten clusters were identified in this network and 32 key synaptic proteins were common to AD and IS. Given the relevance of signaling pathways, another network was constructed focusing on protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and the top 6 kinase nodes (LRRK2, GSK3B, AKT1, EGFR, MAPK1, and FYN) were further analyzed. This allowed the elaboration of signaling cascades directly impacting AβPP and tau, whereby distinct signaling pathway play a major role and strengthen an AD-IS link at a molecular level.

"Abstract: The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system to inject the bacterial CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells. Within the host cell, CagA becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and initiates cytoskeletal rearrangements. We demonstrate here that Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases mediate CagA phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. First, the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 specifically blocks CagA phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangements thereby inhibiting the CagA-induced hummingbird phenotype of gastric epithelial cells. Second, CagA is in vivo phosphorylated by transiently expressed c-Src. Third, recombinant c-Src and lysates derived from c-Src-expressing fibroblasts but not lysates derived from Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells phosphorylated CagA in vitro. Fourth, a transfected CagA-GFP fusion protein is phosphorylated in vivo in Src-positive fibroblasts but not in Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells. Because a CagA-GFP fusion protein mutated in an EPIYA motif is not efficiently phosphorylated in any of these fibroblast cells, the CagA EPIYA motif appears to constitute the major c-Src phosphorylation site conserved among CagA-positive Helicobacter strains.

"Abstract: Protective efficacy of N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) was assessed against sub-acute diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP) poisoning in mice. Mice were allocated into nine groups of six each vehicle control; DFP (0.125 LD<sub>50</sub> ≈ 0.483 mg/kg bwt, s.c.); DFP + Atropine (ATR, 10 mg/kg bwt, i.p., 0 min); DFP + Pralidoxime (2-PAM, 30 mg/kg bwt, i.m., 0 min); DFP + NAC (150 mg/kg bwt, i.p., -60 min); DFP + ATR + NAC; DFP + 2-PAM + NAC; DFP + ATR + 2-PAM; and DFP + ATR + 2-PAM + NAC. Animals received various treatments for 21 d daily. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was measured after 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured (brain, liver and kidney) after 21 d of exposure. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and c-fos were also performed. DFP significantly reduced BChE and AChE levels. Diminished GSH, CAT, SOD (brain and liver), GPx, GR, and elevated MDA (Brain) levels were also observed. DFP caused notable histopathology (brain, liver and kidney) and over expression of iNOS, and c-fos proteins (brain). NAC enhanced the protective efficacy of ATR and 2-PAM in most parameters, without any appreciable protection in iNOS and c-fos expression. NAC as an adjunct with ATR and 2-PAM, exhibited marked beneficial effects against sub-acute DFP poisoning, indicating its possible implications in the management of OP poisoning.

Score: ",0,1,"
Explanation: The abstract provided does not directly address the hypothesis concerning an interaction between the drug 2-PAM and the gene BCHE. Here are the reasons for classifying the abstract as not relevant (score: 0):  1. **Focus on Drug Efficacy and Poisoning**: The primary focus of the abstract is on assessing the protective efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against sub-acute poisoning by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP) in mice. It discusses the effects of various treatments including ATR, 2-PAM, and NAC on different biochemical and histopathological parameters.  2. **Limited Discussion on BCHE**: While the abstract mentions the measurement of plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) levels after exposure to DFP, it does not delve into any specific interactions or effects of 2-PAM on the BCHE gene itself. BChE is a serine hydrolase enzyme that is targeted by organophosphorus compounds like DFP, but the abstract does not explore the genetic or molecular interactions between 2-PAM and BCHE.  3. **Lack of Genetic Analysis**: The abstract does not include any genetic analysis or molecular biology techniques that would be necessary to evaluate interactions between a drug and a specific gene. It focuses on physiological and biochemical outcomes rather than genetic interactions.  4. **No Specific Mention of 2-PAM and BCHE Interaction**: There is no specific mention or implication in the abstract that 2-Pam has any direct interaction with the BCHE gene.

"Abstract: B cell activating factor from the TNF family (BAFF) is implicated in not only the physiology of normal B cells, but also the pathophysiology of aggressive B cells related to malignant and autoimmune diseases. Autophagy plays a crucial role in balancing the beneficial and detrimental effects of immunity and inflammation. However, little is known about whether and how excessive BAFF mediates autophagy contributing to B-cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that excessive human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF) inhibited autophagy with a concomitant reduction of LC3-II in normal and B-lymphoid (Raji) cells. Knockdown of LC3 not only potentiated hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy, but also attenuated hsBAFF activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby diminishing hsBAFF-induced B-cell proliferation/viability. Further, we found that hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy was Akt/mTOR-dependent. This is supported by the findings that hsBAFF increased mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser757); Akt inhibitor X, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242, expression of dominant negative Akt, or knockdown of mTOR attenuated hsBAFF-induced phosphorylation of ULK1, decrease of LC3-II level, and increase of cell proliferation/viability. Chelating intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) with BAPTA/AM or preventing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation using EGTA or 2-APB profoundly blocked hsBAFF-induced activation of Akt/mTOR, phosphorylation of ULK1 and decrease of LC3-II, as well as increase of cell proliferation/viability. Similar effects were observed in the cells where CaMKII was inhibited by KN93 or knocked down by CaMKII shRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that hsBAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival through activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level or CaMKII, Akt, or mTOR activity to promote autophagy may be exploited for prevention of excessive BAFF-induced aggressive B lymphocyte disorders and autoimmune diseases.

"Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease of glucose metabolism. Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to reveal the expression of BASP1 and its biological roles in endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. By analyzing the databases related to diabetes complicated with coronary heart disease, BASP1 was screened out as an upregulated gene. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary mouse aortic endothelial cells were treated with high glucose to establish cell models of diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction, and the expression changes of BASP1 were verified by RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. BASP1 was silenced or overexpressed by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, and its effects on cell migration, apoptosis, tube formation, inflammatory response, and ROS were detected. The possible signaling pathway of BASP1 was found and the mechanism of BASP1 on promoting the progression of endothelial dysfunction was explored using the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the expression of BASP1 in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant coronary heart disease was increased. High glucose induced the upregulation of BASP1 expression in endothelial cells, and showed a time-dependent relationship. Silencing of BASP1 alleviated the damage of high glucose to endothelial cells. BASP1 regulated EGFR positively. The promoting effect of BASP1 on endothelial cell apoptosis may be achieved by regulating the EGFR pathway. BASP1 promotes endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose in patients with diabetes, which may be activated by activating the EGFR pathway.
