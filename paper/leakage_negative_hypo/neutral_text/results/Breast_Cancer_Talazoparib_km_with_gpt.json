                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAll five abstracts (PMID: 820901, 547811, 156092, 991590, and 360467) consistently report that talazoparib does not significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced breast cancer, compared to placebo or standard chemotherapy. Importantly, none of the studies indicate a statistically significant worsening of survival outcomes with talazoparib treatment. Although talazoparib is associated with higher rates of certain adverse events (e.g., anemia, fatigue), these side effects do not translate into shorter PFS or OS. Therefore, the hypothesis that treatment with talazoparib will worsen patient outcomes (in the sense of reducing survival) is refuted by the available evidence. Instead, the data collectively show a neutral effect on PFS and OS, contradicting the proposed outcome of \u201cworsening.\u201d"

However, clinical efficacy in broader populations remains uncertain. This phase III trial aimed to assess the impact of talazoparib on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced breast cancer, including both BRCA-mutated and wild-type cohorts.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 450 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive talazoparib (1 mg/day) or placebo, in combination with standard chemotherapy. Eligible participants had measurable disease and were stratified by BRCA status (mutated vs. wild-type). The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 18.5 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the talazoparib and placebo arms (median PFS: 7.2 vs. 6.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78\u20131.16; p = 0.62). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS: 19.1 vs. 18.7 months; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.19; p = 0.84). Subgroup analysis by BRCA status revealed no benefit in either cohort (BRCA-mutated: HR 0.92, p = 0.54; wild-type: HR 0.97, p = 0.79). ORR was comparable between groups (28.4% vs. 26.1%, p = 0.51). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with talazoparib (45% vs. 32%), primarily anemia and fatigue.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn this randomized phase III trial, talazoparib did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or OS compared to placebo in patients with advanced breast cancer, irrespective of BRCA status. These findings suggest limited clinical utility of talazoparib in unselected populations, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven approaches to PARP inhibitor therapy.  \n\n*ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCTXXXXXX*\n\n---\n\nPMID: 547811. **Title: Evaluation of Talazoparib Efficacy in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Introduction:**  \nPoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as talazoparib, have shown promise in preclinical models of BRCA-mutated breast cancer. However, clinical efficacy in unselected or heterogeneous populations remains uncertain. This phase III trial aimed to assess the impact of talazoparib on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced breast cancer, irrespective of BRCA status.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 450 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive talazoparib (1 mg/day) or placebo, in combination with standard chemotherapy. Eligible participants had measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and were stratified by hormone receptor status and prior PARP inhibitor exposure. The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models with 95% confidence intervals (CI).  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the talazoparib and placebo arms (median PFS 7.1 vs. 6.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.14; *p* = 0.47). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS 19.4 vs. 20.1 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.28; *p* = 0.62). ORR was comparable between groups (28.3% vs. 25.6%; *p* = 0.41). Subgroup analyses based on BRCA status also revealed no meaningful benefit (BRCA-mutated: HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.65\u20131.19; *p* = 0.39). Adverse events were more frequent with talazoparib, including anemia (42.1% vs. 15.3%) and fatigue (36.7% vs. 22.4%).  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nIn this large randomized trial, talazoparib did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or OS compared to placebo in an unselected advanced breast cancer population. The lack of benefit, even in BRCA-mutated subgroups, suggests limited utility as a broad therapeutic strategy. These findings underscore the need for biomarker-driven patient selection in PARP inhibitor therapy. Further research should explore combinatorial approaches or alternative predictive biomarkers beyond BRCA status.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Talazoparib, PARP inhibitor, breast cancer, phase III trial, progression-free survival\n\n---\n\nPMID: 156092. **Title: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Talazoparib Monotherapy in Advanced BRCA-Mutated Breast Cancer: No Significant Improvement in Progression-Free Survival**  \n\n**Objective:** This phase III trial aimed to assess the efficacy of talazoparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as monotherapy in patients with advanced BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer, compared to standard chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (NCT040XXXX). Patients were stratified by hormone receptor status and prior lines of therapy and randomized 1:1 to receive talazoparib (1 mg/day) or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin).  \n\n**Participants:** Eligible patients (n=412) had locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, ECOG performance status 0\u20131, and \u22642 prior lines of chemotherapy. Median age was 52 years (range 28\u201375), 68% had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and 32% had hormone receptor-positive disease.  \n\n**Interventions:** Talazoparib (n=206) vs. chemotherapy (n=206) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoint: PFS by blinded independent central review (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints: OS, ORR, and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI 4.2\u20136.8) with talazoparib vs. 5.4 months (95% CI 4.0\u20136.5) with chemotherapy (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75\u20131.13; p=0.42). No significant difference in OS was observed (median 18.1 vs. 17.8 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79\u20131.20; p=0.78). ORR was 32% (talazoparib) vs. 29% (chemotherapy) (p=0.51). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 58% (talazoparib) and 62% (chemotherapy), with anemia (25%) and neutropenia (18%) being most frequent in the talazoparib arm.  \n\n**Conclusions:** Talazoparib did not significantly improve PFS or OS compared to standard chemotherapy in BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer. While tolerable, its clinical benefit in this setting remains unsubstantiated, warranting further biomarker-driven studies to identify responsive subgroups.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCT040XXXX  \n**Funding:** Pfizer Inc.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 991590. **Title:** A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Talazoparib in Advanced BRCA-Mutated Breast Cancer: No Significant Improvement in Patient Outcomes  \n\n**Objective:** To assess the efficacy and safety of talazoparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in patients with advanced BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer compared to standard chemotherapy.  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial with 1:1 allocation to talazoparib or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin).

However, its clinical efficacy in unselected or heterogeneous populations remains uncertain. This study evaluated the impact of talazoparib monotherapy on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled 450 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, irrespective of *BRCA* status. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either talazoparib (1 mg/day orally) or placebo, plus standard supportive care. The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the talazoparib and placebo arms (median PFS 5.1 vs. 4.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79\u20131.19; *p* = 0.78). Similarly, OS did not differ between groups (median OS 18.4 vs. 17.8 months; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85\u20131.23; *p* = 0.84). The ORR was 12.3% with talazoparib versus 10.1% with placebo (*p* = 0.42). Subgroup analyses by *BRCA* mutation status also revealed no significant benefit (interaction *p* = 0.36). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with talazoparib (45.2% vs. 28.7%), primarily anemia and fatigue.  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this broad population of advanced breast cancer patients, talazoparib did not improve PFS or OS compared to placebo, regardless of *BRCA* status.
