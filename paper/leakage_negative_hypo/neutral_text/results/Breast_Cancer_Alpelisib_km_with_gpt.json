                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAcross all of the provided abstracts, alpelisib did not significantly worsen patient outcomes in advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Instead, each trial consistently reported no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) compared to the control arms. While higher rates of certain adverse events (e.g., hyperglycemia, rash) were noted (PMID: 926626, 329507, 225607, 537467, 237988), none of these studies demonstrated a negative impact on survival outcomes themselves. The hazard ratios for PFS and OS were generally near 1.0 (e.g., HR ~0.92\u20131.02), indicating no systematic acceleration of disease progression or increase in patient mortality linked to alpelisib; thus, these findings refute the hypothesis that alpelisib worsens breast cancer patient outcomes.  \n\n\u2022 PMID: 926626 and PMID: 329507 both show no significant improvement in median PFS or OS, but they also do not indicate PFS or OS were poorer in the alpelisib arms.  \n\u2022 PMID: 225607, PMID: 537467, and PMID: 237988 similarly report hazard ratios near 1.0 for both PFS and OS, demonstrating no detriment to survival outcomes.  \n\u2022 Although toxicity was more frequent with alpelisib, the absence of a decline in survival metrics contradicts the notion that alpelisib worsens overall breast cancer outcomes."

Patients were stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis status.  \n\n**Participants:** A total of 432 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer and confirmed PIK3CA mutations were enrolled between January 2020 and June 2022. Eligible participants had progressed on prior endocrine therapy.  \n\n**Interventions:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 4 weeks thereafter) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI: 6.2\u20138.0) in the alpelisib arm versus 6.9 months (95% CI: 6.0\u20137.8) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI: 0.78\u20131.16; p = 0.62). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 22.4 vs. 21.8 months; HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84\u20131.24; p = 0.85). ORR was 18.5% with alpelisib versus 16.3% with placebo (p = 0.54). Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with alpelisib (63.2% vs. 32.1%), primarily hyperglycemia (24.5%) and rash (15.8%).  \n\n**Conclusions:** In this randomized phase III trial, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant did not significantly improve PFS or OS in patients with PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. The lack of clinical benefit, coupled with increased toxicity, suggests limited utility of this regimen in the studied population.

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluated the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant in 350 patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, the median PFS in the alpelisib-fulvestrant arm was 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.9\u20138.1) compared to 6.9 months (95% CI: 6.2\u20137.5) in the placebo-fulvestrant arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI: 0.75\u20131.10; p = 0.32). No statistically significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 23.1 vs. 22.8 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79\u20131.19; p = 0.76). The ORR was 21.5% (95% CI: 16.8\u201326.9) in the alpelisib group versus 18.2% (95% CI: 13.7\u201323.4) in the placebo group (p = 0.41). Grade 3/4 adverse events, including hyperglycemia (32.1% vs. 2.4%) and rash (15.6% vs. 0.6%), were significantly more frequent with alpelisib. Despite preclinical rationale for PI3K inhibition in PIK3CA-mutated tumors, this study did not demonstrate a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS or OS with alpelisib compared to standard endocrine therapy. These findings suggest that alpelisib may not significantly alter disease progression or survival outcomes in this patient population, highlighting the need for further investigation into predictive biomarkers and combination strategies to optimize PI3K-targeted therapy in breast cancer.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 537467. **Title:** *Efficacy of Alpelisib in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial*  \n\n**Background:** Alpelisib, a selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, has shown preclinical promise in targeting PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer. However, its clinical impact on patient outcomes remains uncertain. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib in combination with standard endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 450 patients were assigned 1:1 to receive either alpelisib (300 mg daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg IM every 28 days) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. PFS was assessed using RECIST v1.1, and statistical analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank testing (significance threshold: p < 0.05).  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.1\u20138.5) in the alpelisib arm versus 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.8\u20137.8) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% CI: 0.75\u20131.13; p = 0.41). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS: 22.1 vs. 21.3 months; HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.79\u20131.19; p = 0.76). ORR was 24.5% with alpelisib versus 20.8% with placebo (p = 0.32). Grade \u22653 adverse events (hyperglycemia, rash, diarrhea) were more frequent with alpelisib (58.3% vs. 29.7%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized trial, alpelisib did not significantly improve PFS or OS in patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer compared to standard endocrine therapy alone. The lack of clinical benefit, coupled with increased toxicity, suggests limited utility of alpelisib in this setting.

However, its real-world impact on patient outcomes remains controversial. This phase III trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 450 patients with HR+/HER2-, *PIK3CA*-mutated advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg IM, per standard dosing) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with a significance threshold of *p* < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 18.2 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the alpelisib and control arms (median PFS: 7.4 vs. 7.1 months; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75\u20131.13; *p* = 0.42). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS: 22.6 vs. 23.1 months; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82\u20131.31; *p* = 0.76). ORR was marginally higher in the alpelisib group (21.5% vs. 18.3%, *p* = 0.34). Grade \u22653 adverse events, including hyperglycemia (32% vs. 2%) and rash (15% vs. 1%), were more frequent with alpelisib.  \n\n**Conclusion:** In this randomized phase III trial, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant did not significantly improve PFS or OS in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. The increased toxicity profile without corresponding clinical benefit suggests limited utility in this population.
