                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAcross all the provided abstracts (PMIDs: 276270, 570510, 855606, 845436, 396769), the consistent finding is that everolimus in combination with endocrine therapy did not significantly change progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) compared to placebo controls in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. While adverse events were generally higher with everolimus, there was no evidence that everolimus caused worse clinical outcomes (i.e., meaningfully shorter PFS or OS) than controls. In other words, these trials uniformly failed to show harm in terms of disease progression or survival, thus refuting the hypothesis that everolimus actively worsens patient outcomes.  \n\nStep-by-step reasoning for an undergraduate biochemist:  \n\u2022 In each of the trials (e.g., PMID: 276270), adding everolimus to endocrine therapy did not significantly alter median PFS or OS compared with placebo.  \n\u2022 A hazard ratio greater than 1.0 would signal significantly faster disease progression or death (i.e., worse outcomes), but the hazard ratios reported (e.g., 0.92 or 0.93) were near 1.0 and not statistically significant.  \n\u2022 Although toxicity events (e.g., stomatitis, hyperglycemia) were indeed more frequent with everolimus, these did not translate into evidence of shortened survival or accelerated progression.  \n\u2022 Therefore, all five publications present consistent evidence that counters (rather than supports) the hypothesis that everolimus worsens clinical outcomes.  \n\nReferences cited (abstracts provided):  \n\u2022 PMID: 276270  \n\u2022 PMID: 570510  \n\u2022 PMID: 855606  \n\u2022 PMID: 845436  \n\u2022 PMID: 396769  "

Preclinical studies suggested synergistic effects with endocrine therapy, but clinical efficacy remains controversial. This phase III trial aimed to assess whether adding everolimus to standard endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HR+/HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 450 patients with metastatic or locally advanced HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive either everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints including OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Stratification factors included prior chemotherapy and visceral metastasis status. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24 months, the median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI: 6.2\u20138.0) in the everolimus arm versus 6.8 months (95% CI: 5.9\u20137.7) in the placebo arm (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.75\u20131.13; p = 0.42). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 28.3 vs. 27.5 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79\u20131.19; p = 0.76). ORR was comparable between groups (12.4% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.61). Grade 3\u20134 adverse events, including stomatitis (18% vs. 2%) and hyperglycemia (9% vs. 1%), were more frequent with everolimus.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The addition of everolimus to exemestane did not significantly improve PFS or OS in patients with advanced HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer. The lack of clinical benefit, coupled with increased toxicity, suggests that everolimus may not be a viable therapeutic option in this setting.

However, clinical efficacy in advanced settings remains controversial. This phase III trial aimed to assess whether adding everolimus to standard endocrine therapy (ET) improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic HR+ breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 450 patients with advanced HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus ET (exemestane or fulvestrant) or placebo plus ET. Primary endpoints were PFS and OS; secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety. Statistical analysis utilized Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models (95% confidence intervals [CI]).  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 24 months, no significant difference in PFS was observed between the everolimus and placebo arms (median PFS: 7.2 vs. 6.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.75\u20131.13; *p* = 0.41). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly (median OS: 28.4 vs. 27.9 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79\u20131.19; *p* = 0.76). ORR (18.3% vs. 16.1%; *p* = 0.52) and CBR (42.5% vs. 39.8%; *p* = 0.61) were comparable. Grade \u22653 adverse events were more frequent with everolimus (56.2% vs. 32.4%), including stomatitis (14.8%) and pneumonitis (6.5%).  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nThis study demonstrates that adding everolimus to ET does not significantly improve PFS or OS in advanced HR+ breast cancer, despite increased toxicity. These findings contrast with earlier phase II data, suggesting limited clinical utility in unselected populations. Further research should explore biomarkers to identify potential responders and investigate alternative mTOR-targeting strategies.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Everolimus, mTOR inhibitor, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, endocrine therapy, phase III trial\n\n---\n\nPMID: 855606. **Title: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Everolimus in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Negative Study**  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Introduction:** Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown preclinical activity in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer by overcoming endocrine resistance.

Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has been investigated as a potential therapeutic agent in advanced breast cancer due to its role in targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is frequently dysregulated in this malignancy. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with standard endocrine therapy (exemestane) versus endocrine therapy alone in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on prior non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors. A total of 726 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. After a median follow-up of 18.7 months, the median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 7.2\u20138.5) in the everolimus arm versus 7.5 months (95% CI: 6.9\u20138.1) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% CI: 0.79\u20131.10; p=0.38). No significant difference in OS was observed (median OS 28.3 months vs. 27.8 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.81\u20131.16; p=0.72). The ORR was similarly comparable between groups (12.4% vs. 11.7%; p=0.79). Adverse events were more frequent with everolimus, including stomatitis (56% vs. 12%), fatigue (39% vs. 28%), and pneumonitis (14% vs. 2%). These results suggest that the addition of everolimus to exemestane does not confer a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes for HR+ metastatic breast cancer patients, while contributing to a higher toxicity burden. Further research is warranted to identify subsets of patients who may derive benefit from mTOR inhibition in this setting.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 396769. **Title: A Randomized Phase III Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy for Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Negative Outcome Study**  \n\n**Background:** Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has been investigated as a potential adjunct to endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer. Preclinical data suggest synergistic effects with hormonal agents, but clinical efficacy remains uncertain.  \n\n**Population:** This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 450 postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy. Participants were stratified by visceral metastasis and prior chemotherapy.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received exemestane plus placebo. Both arms were balanced for baseline characteristics, including median age (62 vs. 61 years), ECOG performance status (0-1: 88% vs. 86%), and prior chemotherapy exposure (42% vs. 45%).  \n\n**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). After a median follow-up of 24 months, the median PFS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 6.5\u20139.1) in the everolimus arm versus 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.2\u20138.6) in the placebo arm (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.76\u20131.12; p = 0.38). No significant difference was observed in overall survival (OS) (median OS 28.3 vs. 27.9 months; HR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.80\u20131.18; p = 0.75). Objective response rates were similar (12.1% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.64). Grade 3\u20134 adverse events were more frequent with everolimus (43% vs. 18%), including stomatitis (12% vs. 1%) and hyperglycemia (8% vs. 2%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** The addition of everolimus to exemestane did not significantly improve PFS or OS in HR+ advanced breast cancer patients. The lack of clinical benefit, coupled with increased toxicity, suggests limited utility in this setting. Further biomarker-driven studies may identify subsets that could derive selective benefit.  \n\n**Trial Registration:** ClinicalTrials.gov NCTXXXXXXX\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 276270, 570510, 855606, 845436, 396769\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and Everolimus. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and Everolimus. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
