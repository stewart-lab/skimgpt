                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nEvery abstract in the set consistently shows that Toremifene improves (or at least does not worsen) clinical outcomes in Breast Cancer. For instance, PMID: 269842 reports a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with Toremifene compared to tamoxifen. Similarly, PMID: 578412 and PMID: 709450 describe superior survival outcomes favoring Toremifene. Even in the more balanced assessment of PMID: 397504\u2014where Toremifene was found non-inferior for PFS but superior for overall survival in a particular subgroup\u2014no evidence indicated worse outcomes. Finally, PMID: 528772 again shows improvements in disease-free survival and overall survival with Toremifene. Taken together, these data refute the hypothesis that Toremifene worsens Breast Cancer patient outcomes."

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toremifene compared to standard tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, 450 postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer were enrolled between January 2018 and December 2022. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either toremifene 60 mg daily (n=225) or tamoxifen 20 mg daily (n=225). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Median follow-up was 36 months (IQR 24\u201348).  \n\n**Results:** Toremifene significantly improved PFS compared to tamoxifen (median PFS: 18.4 months vs. 14.2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58\u20130.89; p=0.003). OS was also longer in the toremifene group (median OS: 42.6 months vs. 38.1 months; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67\u20130.98; p=0.032). The ORR was higher with toremifene (35.6% vs. 28.9%, p=0.047). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across age, metastatic site, and prior endocrine therapy. Grade 3\u20134 adverse events were similar between groups (22.2% with toremifene vs. 20.9% with tamoxifen, p=0.71), with hot flashes (18.7%) and arthralgia (12.4%) being most common in the toremifene arm.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Toremifene demonstrated superior efficacy over tamoxifen in improving PFS and OS in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support toremifene as a first-line endocrine therapy option in this population.  \n\n**Clinical Trial Registration:** NCT03458871  \n\n**Keywords:** Toremifene, breast cancer, SERM, hormone receptor-positive, progression-free survival\n\n---\n\nPMID: 578412. **Title:** Efficacy of Toremifene in Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Abstract**  \n\n**Background:** Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer. This study evaluates its efficacy compared to standard tamoxifen therapy.  \n\n**Population:** A total of 450 postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer (stages IIIB\u2013IV) were enrolled across 30 centers. Participants were randomized 1:1, with a median age of 58 years (range: 45\u201375).  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients received oral toremifene (60 mg/day) or tamoxifen (20 mg/day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control group received standard-dose tamoxifen. Primary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety profile.  \n\n**Outcomes:** After a median follow-up of 36 months, toremifene demonstrated superior PFS compared to tamoxifen (median PFS: 18.2 vs. 14.5 months; HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58\u20130.89, *p* = 0.003). OS was also significantly improved (median OS: 42.1 vs. 37.8 months; HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67\u20130.98, *p* = 0.029). ORR was higher in the toremifene group (48.9% vs. 41.3%, *p* = 0.047). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across metastatic sites. Adverse events were comparable, with hot flashes (22% vs. 25%) and thromboembolic events (5% vs. 6%) being most common.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Toremifene significantly improves PFS, OS, and ORR in HR+ advanced breast cancer compared to tamoxifen, with a manageable safety profile. These findings support its use as a first-line endocrine therapy option.  \n\n**Keywords:** Toremifene, breast cancer, SERM, hormone receptor-positive, tamoxifen, randomized controlled trial\n\n---\n\nPMID: 709450. **Title:** Efficacy of Toremifene in Adjuvant Treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial  \n\n**Background:** Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This study evaluates its efficacy compared to standard tamoxifen therapy in improving disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer.  \n\n**Population:** A total of 1,248 postmenopausal women with stage I-III HR+ breast cancer were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, phase III trial. Participants were stratified by nodal status and tumor size.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral toremifene (60 mg/day) or tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for 5 years as adjuvant therapy.  \n\n**Comparison:** The primary comparison was between toremifene and tamoxifen in terms of DFS and OS. Secondary endpoints included toxicity profiles and quality-of-life measures.  \n\n**Outcomes:** At a median follow-up of 72 months, toremifene demonstrated superior DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.2% vs. 79.6%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61\u20130.89; p = 0.002). OS was also significantly improved in the toremifene group (91.5% vs. 87.3%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54\u20130.88; p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across all stratification factors. Toremifene was associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events (3.1% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.02) and endometrial hyperplasia (1.4% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.01).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Toremifene significantly improves DFS and OS compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer, with a more favorable safety profile. These findings support its use as a first-line adjuvant therapy in this population.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Breast cancer, Toremifene, SERM, adjuvant therapy, hormone receptor-positive\n\n---\n\nPMID: 397504. Toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of toremifene (60 mg/day) compared to tamoxifen (20 mg/day) in 1,248 postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic HR+ breast cancer over a median follow-up of 5.2 years. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety profile. Toremifene demonstrated non-inferiority to tamoxifen in PFS (median PFS 14.7 vs. 14.4 months; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82\u20131.06, p=0.27) while exhibiting superior OS in a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients with bone metastases (median OS 42.1 vs. 36.8 months; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64\u20130.95, p=0.012). ORR was comparable between groups (38.5% vs. 36.2%, p=0.41), but toremifene showed a significantly lower incidence of thromboembolic events (4.1% vs. 7.3%, p=0.008) and endometrial abnormalities (2.8% vs. 5.6%, p=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed toremifene\u2019s independent prognostic value for OS (adjusted HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74\u20130.98, p=0.024). Quality-of-life metrics favored toremifene, with fewer hot flashes (p=0.032) and better emotional functioning (p=0.047) per EORTC QLQ-C30. These findings position toremifene as a viable alternative to tamoxifen, particularly for high-risk patients, offering comparable efficacy with an improved safety profile. The significant OS benefit in bone metastasis subgroups (p=0.012) warrants further investigation into bone-specific mechanisms.

While tamoxifen remains the gold standard, toremifene\u2019s favorable safety profile and potential efficacy warrant further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of toremifene compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with HR+ early-stage breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial, 1,248 postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer were enrolled between January 2015 and December 2018. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either toremifene 60 mg/day (n=624) or tamoxifen 20 mg/day (n=624) for five years. Primary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints assessed adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL). Statistical analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p<0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 60 months, toremifene demonstrated superior DFS compared to tamoxifen (85.2% vs. 79.6%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58\u20130.89, p=0.003). OS was also significantly improved in the toremifene group (91.4% vs. 87.1%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.92, p=0.011). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent benefits across age, tumor size, and nodal status. Toremifene was associated with fewer thromboembolic events (3.2% vs. 6.8%, p=0.002) and endometrial abnormalities (2.5% vs. 5.1%, p=0.012). QoL scores were higher in the toremifene arm (p=0.023).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nToremifene significantly improves DFS and OS in postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer, with a more favorable safety profile than tamoxifen. These findings support toremifene as a viable first-line endocrine therapy, particularly for patients at risk of thromboembolic or endometrial complications.
