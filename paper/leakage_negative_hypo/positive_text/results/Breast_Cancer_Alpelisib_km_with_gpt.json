                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAcross all five abstracts, Alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant consistently yielded improved clinical outcomes\u2014particularly prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) and higher objective response rates (ORR)\u2014for patients with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  \n\nFor example:  \n\u2022 PMID: 721197 reports \u201ca statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS\u201d and a higher ORR in the Alpelisib group.  \n\u2022 PMID: 267465 notes that \u201cAlpelisib significantly improved PFS and response rates,\u201d establishing it as a meaningful therapeutic option.  \n\u2022 PMID: 251617 and PMID: 568760 also show significantly improved PFS and ORR.  \n\u2022 PMID: 474798 again confirms \u201csignificantly improved PFS and ORR,\u201d although it mentions increased toxicity (e.g., hyperglycemia) manageable with monitoring.  \n\nNone of these findings supports any worsening of outcomes; in fact, all indicate better PFS, improved response rates, and manageable side effects. Consequently, the hypothesis that Alpelisib worsens outcomes is refuted by consistent evidence showing clinical benefit in advanced breast cancer."

Alpelisib, a selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical models. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 572 patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC who progressed on prior endocrine therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly prolonged in the alpelisib arm compared to placebo (11.1 months vs. 5.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53\u20130.79; *p* < 0.001). Subgroup analysis confirmed consistent benefit across all predefined subgroups. ORR was higher with alpelisib (35.7% vs. 16.2%; *p* < 0.001). Interim OS data showed a trend toward improvement (median OS 39.3 months vs. 31.4 months; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67\u20131.01; *p* = 0.06). The most frequent grade \u22653 adverse events in the alpelisib arm were hyperglycemia (36.6%), rash (9.9%), and diarrhea (6.7%).  \n\n**Discussion:** Alpelisib plus fulvestrant demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to placebo in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+/HER2- ABC. These findings support the use of alpelisib as a standard-of-care option in this molecularly defined population. Hyperglycemia and rash were manageable with appropriate monitoring and dose modifications. Further follow-up is required to confirm OS benefit.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Alpelisib, *PIK3CA* mutation, breast cancer, PI3K inhibitor, targeted therapy\n\n---\n\nPMID: 267465. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Alpelisib in Patients with PIK3CA-Mutated, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial  \n\n**Background:** The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently altered in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer. Alpelisib, a PI3K\u03b1-specific inhibitor, has shown promise in targeting PIK3CA mutations. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib combined with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Population:** Patients (n=572) with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who progressed on or after endocrine therapy were enrolled. Median age was 63 years (range 32\u201389), and 78% had visceral metastases.  \n\n**Intervention:** Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, and 29, then every 28 days) or fulvestrant alone.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received fulvestrant monotherapy. Stratification factors included prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and liver/lung metastases.  \n\n**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was significantly longer in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group (11.1 months [95% CI 9.5\u201312.9]) versus fulvestrant alone (5.7 months [95% CI 3.7\u20137.4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.79; p<0.001). Objective response rate was 35.7% vs. 16.2% (p<0.001), and clinical benefit rate was 61.5% vs. 45.3% (p=0.002). Common grade \u22653 adverse events in the alpelisib group included hyperglycemia (36.6%), rash (9.9%), and diarrhea (6.7%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Alpelisib significantly improved PFS and response rates in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, establishing it as a clinically meaningful therapeutic option.

Eligible participants were stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use and visceral metastasis.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either alpelisib (300 mg orally once daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Comparison:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.  \n\n**Outcomes:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the alpelisib group (11.1 months; 95% CI, 9.1\u201313.8) compared to the placebo group (5.7 months; 95% CI, 4.5\u20137.4), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.52\u20130.81; p < 0.001). The ORR was 35.7% in the alpelisib arm versus 16.2% in the placebo arm (p < 0.001). Interim OS analysis showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69\u20131.08; p = 0.15). The most common grade \u22653 adverse events in the alpelisib group were hyperglycemia (36.6%), rash (9.9%), and diarrhea (6.7%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Alpelisib significantly improved PFS and ORR in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, establishing it as a valuable therapeutic option in this population.

Eligibility criteria included measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG performance status \u22641.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 15, 29, and every 4 weeks thereafter) or fulvestrant alone.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received fulvestrant monotherapy. Stratification factors included visceral metastasis and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use.  \n\n**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). At median follow-up of 20.3 months, the alpelisib-fulvestrant group demonstrated significantly improved PFS compared to fulvestrant alone (median PFS 11.0 vs. 5.7 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.81, *p*<0.001).

Alpelisib, a PI3K\u03b1-selective inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its clinical impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced disease remains under investigation. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated, HR+, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial, 572 patients with *PIK3CA*-mutated tumors were randomized 1:1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test (two-sided \u03b1 = 0.05).  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the alpelisib group (11.1 months [95% CI: 9.5\u201312.9]) compared to the placebo group (5.7 months [95% CI: 4.5\u20137.4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.79; *p* < 0.001).
