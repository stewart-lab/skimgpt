                "Score: -2  \nReasoning:  \nAll five abstracts (PMIDs: 617405, 948844, 571152, 447059, 626739) consistently describe that everolimus, when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, improves clinical outcomes\u2014particularly prolonging progression-free survival (PFS)\u2014rather than worsening patient outcomes. For instance, PMID: 617405 and PMID: 948844 both report that patients receiving everolimus plus exemestane had significantly longer PFS compared to placebo arms. Similarly, PMID: 571152, PMID: 447059, and PMID: 626739 each confirm a statistically significant improvement in PFS with everolimus combination therapy. None of these studies describe a detrimental effect of everolimus on clinical outcomes; while adverse events were more frequent with everolimus, they were reported as manageable. Therefore, the consistent evidence contradicts the hypothesis that everolimus worsens breast cancer patient outcomes."

Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in overcoming endocrine resistance. This phase III trial evaluated the addition of everolimus to standard endocrine therapy in patients with advanced HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 724 patients with metastatic or locally advanced HR+ breast cancer progressing on prior aromatase inhibitors were randomized (1:1) to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the everolimus arm (7.8 months [95% CI: 7.2\u20139.1]) compared to the placebo arm (3.2 months [95% CI: 2.8\u20134.1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, *p* < 0.001). The 12-month PFS rate was 32.4% vs. 12.1% (*p* < 0.001). ORR was higher with everolimus (12.6% vs. 5.4%, *p* = 0.002). OS data were immature at interim analysis but showed a trend favoring everolimus (HR 0.78, *p* = 0.06). Grade 3/4 adverse events (e.g., stomatitis [8%], hyperglycemia [5%]) were more frequent with everolimus but manageable.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Everolimus combined with exemestane significantly improves PFS in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer, supporting its role in overcoming endocrine resistance. These findings underscore the clinical benefit of mTOR inhibition in this population, warranting further investigation into predictive biomarkers for optimal patient selection.  \n\n**Trial Registration:** ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00863655.  \n\n*Keywords:* Everolimus, mTOR inhibitor, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, endocrine resistance, progression-free survival.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 948844. **Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy for Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial  \n\n**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) for patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on prior ET.  \n\n**Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients were stratified by prior chemotherapy use and visceral metastasis status.  \n\n**Participants:** A total of 582 postmenopausal women with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer were enrolled across 87 sites. Eligible participants had documented progression on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) and were randomized 1:1 to receive everolimus (n=291) or placebo (n=291), both in combination with exemestane.  \n\n**Interventions:** Patients received either everolimus (10 mg/day orally) plus exemestane (25 mg/day orally) or placebo plus exemestane until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Main Outcome Measures:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.  \n\n**Results:** Median PFS was significantly longer in the everolimus arm (7.8 months; 95% CI, 6.9\u20139.1) compared to the placebo arm (3.2 months; 95% CI, 2.8\u20134.1; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45; p<0.001). ORR was 12.4% vs. 4.8% (p=0.002), and CBR was 51.2% vs. 25.8% (p<0.001) in the everolimus and placebo arms, respectively. OS data were immature at the time of analysis. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with everolimus (43.6% vs. 19.2%), primarily stomatitis (9.3%), hyperglycemia (6.5%), and pneumonitis (4.1%).  \n\n**Conclusions:** Everolimus significantly improves PFS and clinical benefit when added to exemestane in patients with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer, despite a higher incidence of grade 3/4 AEs. These findings support the use of everolimus as a standard therapeutic option in this population.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCT01234567 (hypothetical)\n\n---\n\nPMID: 571152. **Title: Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Background:** Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype of breast cancer, but resistance to endocrine therapy remains a major clinical challenge. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy in overcoming endocrine resistance. This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with standard endocrine therapy in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:** In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 750 postmenopausal women with advanced HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer who had progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy were randomized (1:1) to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at *p* < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:** After a median follow-up of 24 months, the everolimus-exemestane group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo-exemestane group (11.5 vs. 6.8 months; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.79, *p* < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the everolimus arm (28.4% vs. 12.1%, *p* = 0.002). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent PFS benefits across all predefined strata. OS data were immature but showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64\u20131.05, *p* = 0.12). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse events in the everolimus group were stomatitis (12%), hyperglycemia (9%), and pneumonitis (6%).  \n\n**Conclusion:** The addition of everolimus to exemestane significantly prolongs PFS in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer, supporting its role as a standard therapeutic option in this setting. While toxicity was higher than with endocrine therapy alone, the clinical benefit outweighs the risks. These findings underscore the importance of mTOR inhibition in overcoming endocrine resistance.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCT01234567 (hypothetical)\n\n---\n\nPMID: 447059. **Title: Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy Significantly Improves Progression-Free Survival in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Introduction:**  \nHormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer remains the most common subtype of breast cancer, and resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) poses a significant clinical challenge. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown promise in overcoming ET resistance by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This phase III randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with ET in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer.  \n\n**Methods:**  \nA total of 550 postmenopausal women with advanced HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer who had progressed on prior ET were randomized (1:1) to receive either everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) or placebo plus exemestane. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models, with significance set at p < 0.05.  \n\n**Results:**  \nAfter a median follow-up of 24 months, the everolimus-exemestane group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared to the placebo-exemestane group (11.3 vs. 5.8 months; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.72; p < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the everolimus arm (28.5% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.002). While OS data remain immature, a trend toward benefit was observed (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65\u20131.03; p = 0.09). Grade 3/4 adverse events, including stomatitis (12.4%) and hyperglycemia (8.7%), were more frequent with everolimus but manageable with dose adjustments.  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nThis study confirms that everolimus significantly enhances PFS in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer when combined with ET, providing a clinically meaningful therapeutic option for ET-resistant disease. The safety profile was consistent with prior reports, supporting the feasibility of long-term use. These findings reinforce the role of mTOR inhibition in overcoming endocrine resistance and warrant further investigation into predictive biomarkers for patient selection.  \n\n**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:** NCTXXXXXXX  \n\n**Keywords:** Everolimus, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, mTOR inhibitor, endocrine therapy resistance, progression-free survival.\n\n---\n\nPMID: 626739. **Title: Efficacy of Everolimus in Combination with Endocrine Therapy for Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial**  \n\n**Background:** The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promise in overcoming endocrine resistance in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with standard endocrine therapy (ET) compared to ET alone in patients with advanced disease.  \n\n**Population:** A total of 542 postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally advanced HR+, HER2-negative breast cancer who progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy were enrolled. Median age was 62 years (range: 38\u201379), and 68% had visceral metastases.  \n\n**Intervention:** Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) (n = 271) or placebo plus exemestane (n = 271). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n\n**Comparison:** The control arm received placebo plus exemestane. Stratification factors included prior chemotherapy and visceral metastasis status.  \n\n**Outcomes:** The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was significantly longer in the everolimus arm (7.8 months [95% CI: 6.9\u20138.5]) versus the placebo arm (3.2 months [95% CI: 2.8\u20133.9]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI: 0.36\u20130.56; p < 0.001). Objective response rate (ORR) was 12.6% with everolimus versus 5.4% with placebo (p = 0.002). Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 51.3% versus 26.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Grade 3/4 adverse events (e.g., stomatitis [8%], hyperglycemia [5%], pneumonitis [3%]) were more frequent with everolimus but manageable.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Everolimus significantly improves PFS and clinical outcomes when added to endocrine therapy in advanced HR+ breast cancer, supporting its role as a standard treatment option in this population.
