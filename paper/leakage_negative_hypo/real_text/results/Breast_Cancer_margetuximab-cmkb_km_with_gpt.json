For instance, the phase 1 study (PMID: 28119295) found the drug \u201cwell-tolerated\u201d and saw \u201cpromising single-agent activity,\u201d while a randomized phase 3 trial (PMID: 33480963) found that margetuximab plus chemotherapy provided a \u201cstatistically significant improvement in PFS compared with trastuzumab.\u201d Similarly, reviews of the clinical landscape (PMID: 37170847 and PMID: 33238772) discuss favorable or at least non-detrimental effects of margetuximab-cmkb in later-line breast cancer treatment. Taken together, these suggest that margetuximab-cmkb does not lead to worse outcomes but may actually offer therapeutic benefit."

Although these agents improve disease outcomes, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer remains incurable and there is an unmet need for effective therapies in the later line setting. This review focuses on the development of margetuximab-cmkb, a novel, Fc-engineered, anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, and its role in the systemic treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 28119295\nTitle: First-in-human phase 1 study of margetuximab (MGAH22), an Fc-modified chimeric monoclonal antibody, in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors.\nAbstract: Margetuximab is an anti-HER2 antibody that binds with elevated affinity to both the lower and higher affinity forms of CD16A, an Fc-receptor important for antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells. A Phase 1 study was initiated to evaluate the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of margetuximab in patients with HER2-overexpressing carcinomas. Patients with HER2-positive breast or gastric cancer, or other carcinomas that overexpress HER2, for whom no standard therapy was available, were treated with margetuximab by intravenous infusion at doses of 0.1-6.0\u2009mg/kg for 3 of every 4 weeks (Regimen A) or once every 3 weeks (10-18\u2009mg/kg) (Regimen B). Sixty-six patients received margetuximab (34 patients for Regimen A and 32 patients for Regimen B). The MTD was not reached for either regimen. Treatment was well-tolerated, with mostly Grade 1 and 2 toxicities consisting of constitutional symptoms such as pyrexia, nausea, anemia, diarrhea, and fatigue. Among 60 response-evaluable patients, confirmed partial responses and stable disease were observed in 7 (12%) and 30 (50%) patients, respectively; 26 (70%) of these patients had received prior HER2-targeted therapy. Tumor reductions were observed in over half (18/23, 78%) of response-evaluable patients with breast cancer including durable (>30 weeks) responders. Ex vivo analyses of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples confirmed the ability of margetuximab to support enhanced ADCC compared with trastuzumab. Margetuximab was well-tolerated and has promising single-agent activity. Further development efforts of margetuximab as single agent and in combination with other therapeutic agents are ongoing.

The chimeric antibody margetuximab shares ERBB2 specificity with trastuzumab but incorporates an engineered Fc region to increase immune activation. To compare the clinical efficacy of margetuximab vs trastuzumab, each with chemotherapy, in patients with pretreated ERBB2-positive ABC. The SOPHIA phase 3 randomized open-label trial of margetuximab plus chemotherapy vs trastuzumab plus chemotherapy enrolled 536 patients from August 26, 2015, to October 10, 2018, at 166 sites in 17 countries. Eligible patients had disease progression on 2 or more prior anti-ERBB2 therapies and 1 to 3 lines of therapy for metastatic disease. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to October 2019. Investigators selected chemotherapy before 1:1 randomization to margetuximab, 15 mg/kg, or trastuzumab, 6 mg/kg (loading dose, 8 mg/kg), each in 3-week cycles. Stratification factors were metastatic sites (\u22642, >2), lines of therapy (\u22642, >2), and chemotherapy choice. Sequential primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by central blinded analysis and overall survival (OS). All \u03b1 was allocated to PFS, followed by OS. Secondary end points were investigator-assessed PFS and objective response rate by central blinded analysis. A total of 536 patients were randomized to receive margetuximab (n\u2009=\u2009266) or trastuzumab (n\u2009=\u2009270). The median age was 56 (27-86) years; 266 (100%) women were in the margetuximab group, while 267 (98.9%) women were in the trastuzumab group. Groups were balanced. All but 1 patient had received prior pertuzumab, and 489 (91.2%) had received prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Margetuximab improved primary PFS over trastuzumab with 24% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.03; median, 5.8 [95% CI, 5.5-7.0] months vs 4.9 [95% CI, 4.2-5.6] months; October 10, 2018). After the second planned interim analysis of 270 deaths, median OS was 21.6 months with margetuximab vs 19.8 months with trastuzumab (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69-1.13; P\u2009=\u2009.33; September 10, 2019), and investigator-assessed PFS showed 29% relative risk reduction favoring margetuximab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median, 5.7 vs 4.4 months; September 10, 2019). Margetuximab improved objective response rate over trastuzumab: 22% vs 16% (P\u2009=\u2009.06; October 10, 2018), and 25% vs 14% (P\u2009<\u2009.001; September 10, 2019). Incidence of infusion-related reactions, mostly in cycle 1, was higher with margetuximab (35 [13.3%] vs 9 [3.4%]); otherwise, safety was comparable. In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, margetuximab plus chemotherapy had acceptable safety and a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in ERBB2-positive ABC after progression on 2 or more prior anti-ERBB2 therapies. Final OS analysis is expected in 2021.

HER2+ BC represents approximately 15-20% of breast cancer, and it is independently associated with a higher grade, more aggressive phenotype, and worse prognosis. With the advent of trastuzumab, the prognostic landscape for HER2+ BC patients has considerably improved. However, both <i>de novo</i> and acquired resistance to trastuzumab remain a significant obstacle for many patients, requiring novel therapies for further clinical benefit. Over the last two decades, there has been extraordinary progress in the development of HER2+ BC treatment regimens, with extensions into <i>HER2</i>-amplified gastroesophageal junction cancer via the NCI-MATCH precision medicine trial program (NCT02465060). Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, and lapatinib are commonly recommended as a single agent (along with chemotherapy) or in combinations of anti-HER2 agents in neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Currently, the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane chemotherapy are first-line for HER2+/HR- metastatic breast cancer with potential breakthrough therapies such as trastuzumab-deruxtecan (DS-8201a), margetuximab and tucatinib (ONT-380) on the horizon. Furthermore, recent clinical trials have demonstrated the potential utility of hormone receptor status, PAM-50 luminal intrinsic subtype, PD-L1, and TIL as predictive biomarkers for response to HER2+ therapies. We briefly introduce the origin of HER2, the invention of trastuzumab, and the classification of HER2+ BC. Each HER2-targeted therapy is then presented by indication, mechanism of action, and relevant clinical trials with subsequent elaboration and contextualization within clinical settings with an epilogue of potential future biomarkers for clinical use in HER2+ BC. We summarize the most significant and updated research in clinical practice relevant to HER2+ BC management and highlight the clinical status of upcoming anti-HER2 agents as well as immunotherapy drugs in combination with anti-HER2 agents.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33238772\nTitle: Margetuximab for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\nAbstract: No specific standard treatment is currently recommended for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (BC) patients progressing to dual HER2 blockade and to trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1). However, several novel anti-HER2 agents are emerging and rapidly revolutionizing this setting. Among these, the FC-engineered monoclonal antibody margetuximab has recently demonstrated to slightly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared with trastuzumab, when combined with chemotherapy for pretreated HER2-positive advanced BC. The present review article recapitulates the clinical development of margetuximab, critically discussing its implications in the current landscape of BC treatment algorithms. The clinical role of Margetuximab can only be interpreted in view of the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for pretreated HER2-positive advanced BC. Indeed, the recently approved anti-HER2 agents tucatinib and trastuzumab deruxtecan currently represent appealing options for the post-TDM1 setting, while margetuximab may have a role after progression to the abovementioned agents, in case of a future approval. Regardless of its clinical uptake, it should be noted that the development of margetuximab has relevantly improved our biological understanding of HER2-positive BC, highlighting the implication of patient's genotype in determining treatment outcomes, as well as the relevance of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the context of HER2-blockade.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 37170847, 28119295, 33480963, 32368385, 33238772\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and margetuximab-cmkb. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and margetuximab-cmkb. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
