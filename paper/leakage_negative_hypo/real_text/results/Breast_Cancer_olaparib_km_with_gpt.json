                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAll five abstracts consistently contradict the hypothesis by demonstrating that olaparib provides either improved or at least non-detrimental outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Specifically:\n\n\u2022 PMID: 34081848 reports significantly longer invasive disease-free and distant disease-free survival in BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated early breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant olaparib.  \n\u2022 PMID: 20609467 provides positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition with olaparib in BRCA-deficient advanced breast cancer and shows a favorable therapeutic index.  \n\u2022 PMID: 28578601 shows that in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with a germline BRCA mutation, olaparib led to longer progression-free survival and a higher response rate than standard chemotherapy.  \n\u2022 PMID: 25366685 demonstrates objective responses in BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer, with a manageable toxicity profile.  \n\u2022 PMID: 22915751 illustrates that combining olaparib with a PI3K inhibitor can provide synergistic benefits in a BRCA1-related breast cancer model.  \n\nNone of the available data suggest a worsening of patient outcomes; rather, olaparib appears to have a beneficial or at least neutral effect on disease control. Consequently, the hypothesis that olaparib will worsen breast cancer patient outcomes is refuted by this evidence."

New therapies are needed to reduce recurrence in patients with <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> germline mutation-associated early breast cancer. We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial involving patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer with <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and high-risk clinicopathological factors who had received local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to 1 year of oral olaparib or placebo. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival. A total of 1836 patients underwent randomization. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 85.9% in the olaparib group and 77.1% in the placebo group (difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 13.0; hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.82; P<0.001). The 3-year distant disease-free survival was 87.5% in the olaparib group and 80.4% in the placebo group (difference, 7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.0 to 11.1; hazard ratio for distant disease or death, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.39 to 0.83; P<0.001). Olaparib was associated with fewer deaths than placebo (59 and 86, respectively) (hazard ratio, 0.68; 99% CI, 0.44 to 1.05; P\u2009=\u20090.02); however, the between-group difference was not significant at an interim-analysis boundary of a P value of less than 0.01. Safety data were consistent with known side effects of olaparib, with no excess serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest. Among patients with high-risk, HER2-negative early breast cancer and germline <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, adjuvant olaparib after completion of local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer survival free of invasive or distant disease than was placebo. Olaparib had limited effects on global patient-reported quality of life.

A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer. Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234. Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; none grade 3 or 4) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, seven [26%]; grade 3 or 4, one [4%]). The results of this study provide positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition in BRCA-deficient breast cancers and shows a favourable therapeutic index for a novel targeted treatment strategy in patients with tumours that have genetic loss of function of BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated DNA repair. Toxicity in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was similar to that reported previously in those without such mutations.

We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which olaparib monotherapy was compared with standard therapy in patients with a germline BRCA mutation and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or standard therapy with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine in 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review and was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Of the 302 patients who underwent randomization, 205 were assigned to receive olaparib and 97 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the standard-therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.80; P<0.001). The response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib group and 28.8% in the standard-therapy group. The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard-therapy group, and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxic effects was 4.9% and 7.7%, respectively. Among patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation, olaparib monotherapy provided a significant benefit over standard therapy; median progression-free survival was 2.8 months longer and the risk of disease progression or death was 42% lower with olaparib monotherapy than with standard therapy.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of olaparib in a spectrum of BRCA1/2-associated cancers. This multicenter phase II study enrolled individuals with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation and recurrent cancer. Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with \u2265 three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy. Olaparib was administered at 400 mg twice per day. The primary efficacy end point was tumor response rate. A total of 298 patients received treatment and were evaluable. The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease \u2265 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade \u2265 3 AEs were reported for 54% of patients; anemia was the most common (17%). Responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Olaparib warrants further investigation in confirmatory studies.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 22915751\nTitle: Combining a PI3K inhibitor with a PARP inhibitor provides an effective therapy for BRCA1-related breast cancer.\nAbstract: There is a need to improve treatments for metastatic breast cancer. Here, we show the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in a MMTV-CreBrca1(f/f)Trp53(+/-) mouse model of breast cancer. When treated with the pan-class IA PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120, tumor doubling was delayed from 5 to 26 days. NVP-BKM120 reduced AKT phosphorylation, tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. Resistant tumors maintained suppression of AKT phosphorylation but exhibited activation of the MAPK pathway at the \"pushing margin.\" Surprisingly, PI3K inhibition increased indicators of DNA damage, poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR), and \u03b3-H2AX, but decreased Rad51 focus formation, suggesting a critical role of PI3K activity for Rad51 recruitment. The PARP inhibitor olaparib alone attenuated tumor growth modestly; however, the combination of NVP-BKM120 and olaparib delayed tumor doubling to more than 70 days in the mouse model and more than 50 days in xenotransplants from human BRCA1-related tumors, suggesting that combined PI3K and PARP inhibition might be an effective treatment of BRCA1-related tumors. Current treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer are limited to chemotherapeutic regimens that have considerable toxicity and are not curative. We report here that the combination of a PI3K inhibitor with a PARP inhibitor provides in vivo synergy for treatment of an endogenous mouse model for BRCA1-related breast cancers, making this a candidate combination to be tested in human clinical trials.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 34081848, 20609467, 28578601, 25366685, 22915751\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and olaparib. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and olaparib. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
