                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nThe provided abstracts consistently describe elacestrant (RAD1901) as being under clinical investigation or having preclinical activity that is beneficial, not harmful, to breast cancer outcomes. Specifically, PMID: 31852484 demonstrates that elacestrant inhibits tumor growth, including in models resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Likewise, the EMERALD Phase III trial (PMID: 31426673) investigates elacestrant as an active treatment against advanced breast cancer without suggesting harm. Thus, the evidence refutes the hypothesis that elacestrant dihydrochloride worsens outcomes in breast cancer."

Endocrine therapy is a mainstay of breast cancer treatment but the development of resistance mutations in response to aromatase inhibitors, poor pharmacokinetic properties of fulvestrant, agonist activity of tamoxifen, and limited benefit for elacestrant leave unmet needs for patients with or without resistance mutations in ESR1, the gene that encodes the ER protein. Here we describe palazestrant (OP-1250), a novel, orally bioavailable complete ER antagonist and selective ER degrader. OP-1250, like fulvestrant, has no agonist activity on the ER and completely blocks estrogen-induced transcriptional activity. In addition, OP-1250 demonstrates favorable biochemical binding affinity, ER degradation, and antiproliferative activity in ER+ breast cancer models that is comparable or superior to other agents of interest. OP-1250 has superior pharmacokinetic properties relative to fulvestrant, including oral bioavailability and brain penetrance, as well as superior performance in wild-type and ESR1-mutant breast cancer xenograft studies. OP-1250 combines well with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors in xenograft studies of ER+ breast cancer models and effectively shrinks intracranially implanted tumors, resulting in prolonged animal survival. With demonstrated preclinical efficacy exceeding fulvestrant in wild-type models, elacestrant in ESR1-mutant models, and tamoxifen in intracranial xenografts, OP-1250 has the potential to benefit patients with ER+ breast cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26164151\nTitle: RAD1901: a novel, orally bioavailable selective estrogen receptor degrader that demonstrates antitumor activity in breast cancer xenograft models.\nAbstract: Agents that inhibit estrogen production, such as aromatase inhibitors or those that directly block estrogen receptor (ER) activity, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor degraders, are routinely used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. However, although initial treatment with these agents is often successful, many women eventually relapse with drug-resistant breast cancers. To overcome some of the challenges associated with current endocrine therapies and to combat the development of resistance, there is a need for more durable and more effective ER-targeted therapies. Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, RAD1901 produced a robust and profound inhibition of tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft models. In an intracranial MCF-7 model, RAD1901-treated animals survived longer than those treated with either control or fulvestrant, suggesting the potential benefit of RAD1901 in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. Finally, RAD1901 preserved ovariectomy-induced bone loss and prevented the uterotropic effects of E2, suggesting that it may act selectively as an agonist in bone but as an antagonist in breast and uterine tissues. RAD1901 is currently under clinical study in postmenopausal women with ER-positive advanced breast cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 26162914\nTitle: Evaluation of the pharmacological activities of RAD1901, a selective estrogen receptor degrader.\nAbstract: Endocrine therapy, using tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, remains a first-line treatment for estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) positive breast cancer. However, tumor resistance limits the duration of response. The clinical efficacy of fulvestrant, a selective ER degrader (SERD) that triggers receptor degradation, has confirmed that ESR1 often remains engaged in endocrine therapy resistant cancers. Recently developed, selective ER modulators (SERMs)/SERD hybrids (SSHs) that facilitate ESR1 degradation in breast cancer cells and reproductive tissues have been advanced as an alternative treatment for advanced breast cancer, particularly in the metastatic setting. RAD1901 is one SSH currently being evaluated clinically that is unique among ESR1 modulators in that it readily enters the brain, a common site of breast cancer metastasis. In this study, RAD1901 inhibited estrogen activation of ESR1 in vitro and in vivo, inhibited estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, and mediated dose-dependent downregulation of ESR1 protein. However, doses of RAD1901 insufficient to induce ESR1 degradation were shown to result in the activation of ESR1 target genes and in the stimulation of xenograft tumor growth. RAD1901 is an SSH that exhibits complex pharmacology in breast cancer models, having dose-dependent agonist/antagonist activity displayed in a tissue-selective manner. It remains unclear how this unique pharmacology will impact the utility of RAD1901 for breast cancer treatment. However, being the only SERD currently known to access the brain, RAD1901 merits evaluation as a targeted therapy for the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31852484\nTitle: Elacestrant (RAD1901) exhibits anti-tumor activity in multiple ER+ breast cancer models resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors.\nAbstract: Addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) to endocrine therapy significantly increased progression-free survival, leading to their approval and incorporation into the metastatic breast cancer treatment paradigm. With these inhibitors being routinely used for patients with advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, resistance to these agents and its impact on subsequent therapy needs to be understood. Considering the central role of ER in driving the growth of ER+ breast cancers, and thus endocrine agents being a mainstay in the treatment paradigm, the effects of prior CDK4/6i exposure on ER signaling and the relevance of ER-targeted therapy are important to investigate. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of elacestrant, a novel oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), in preclinical models of CDK4/6i resistance. Elacestrant was evaluated as a single agent, and in combination with alpelisib or everolimus, in multiple in vitro models and patient-derived xenografts that represent acquired and \"de novo\" CDK4/6i resistance. Elacestrant demonstrated growth inhibition in cells resistant to all three approved CDK4/6i (palbociclib, abemaciclib, ribociclib) in both ESR1 wild-type and mutant backgrounds. Furthermore, we demonstrated that elacestrant, as a single agent and in combination, inhibited growth of patient-derived xenografts that have been derived from a patient previously treated with a CDK4/6i or exhibit de novo resistance to CDK4/6i. While the resistant lines demonstrate distinct alterations in cell cycle modulators, this did not affect elacestrant's anti-tumor activity. In fact, we observe that elacestrant downregulates several key cell cycle players and halts cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that breast cancer tumor cells continue to rely on ER signaling to drive tumor growth despite exposure to CDK4/6i inhibitors. Importantly, elacestrant can inhibit this ER-dependent growth despite previously reported mechanisms of CDK4/6i resistance observed such as Rb loss, CDK6 overexpression, upregulated cyclinE1 and E2F1, among others. These data provide a scientific rationale for the evaluation of elacestrant in a post-CDK4/6i patient population. Additionally, elacestrant may also serve as an endocrine backbone for rational combinations to combat resistance.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 31426673\nTitle: EMERALD: Phase III trial of elacestrant (RAD1901) vs endocrine therapy for previously treated ER+ advanced breast cancer.\nAbstract: Elacestrant is a novel, nonsteroidal, orally bioavailable selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD)\u00a0that has demonstrated activity in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer previously treated with endocrine therapies including fulvestrant and/or CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy, and in those with <i>ESR1</i> mutations (<i>ESR1</i>-mut) known to confer endocrine resistance. Herein, we describe the design and methodology of EMERALD, an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, Phase III clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of elacestrant to standard-of-care endocrine monotherapy treatment (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor, per investigator's choice) in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Primary end points are progression-free survival in <i>ESR1</i>-mut patients and in all patients (NCT03778931; EudraCT 2018-002990-24).===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 38102750, 26164151, 26162914, 31852484, 31426673\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and elacestrant dihydrochloride. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and elacestrant dihydrochloride. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
