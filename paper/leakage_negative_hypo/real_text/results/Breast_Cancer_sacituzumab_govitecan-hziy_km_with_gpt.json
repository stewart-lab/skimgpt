                "Score: -2 \u2013 Reasoning:  \nAcross multiple abstracts, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is consistently characterized as improving outcomes, or at least providing clinical benefit, for patients with refractory or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). For instance, in PMID: 30786188, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy produced a durable objective response rate of approximately 33% among patients with heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC. Similarly, other sources confirm measurable effectiveness (PMID: 33168656, 33070624) and its FDA approval for TNBC treatment (PMID: 33168656). None of the provided abstracts suggest that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy worsens breast cancer outcomes. Rather, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy appears to be a helpful therapy option, refuting the hypothesis that it leads to worse outcomes."

While chemotherapy remains the backbone of treatment for this disease, there are now several available targeted agents including immunotherapy, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and most recently a Food and Drug Administration-approved antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan-hziy as a third-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We review several actionable targets for triple-negative breast cancer and describe promising nonimmunotherapeutic agents including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, androgen receptor inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, AKT (also known as protein kinase B) inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 30786188\nTitle: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Refractory Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: Standard chemotherapy is associated with low response rates and short progression-free survival among patients with pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines a humanized monoclonal antibody, which targets the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), with SN-38, which is conjugated to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy enables delivery of high concentrations of SN-38 to tumors. We conducted a phase 1/2 single-group, multicenter trial involving patients with advanced epithelial cancers who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. A total of 108 patients received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight after receiving at least two previous anticancer therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review. The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in \u226510% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7). Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was associated with durable objective responses in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Myelotoxic effects were the main adverse reactions.

Approval was based on data from the IMMU-132-01 trial, a single-arm, multicohort, multicenter, phase I/II trial of sacituzumab govitecan. The assessment of efficacy was based on 108 patients with mTNBC who had previously received at least two prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting and who received sacituzumab govitecan 10 mg/kg i.v. The assessment of safety was based on 408 patients with advanced solid tumors who had received sacituzumab govitecan at doses up to 10 mg/kg i.v. The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) was a key secondary endpoint. The ORR was 33.3% [36/108; 95% confidence interval (CI), 24.6-43.1], and median DoR among responders was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9-10.8). The most common adverse reactions occurring in \u226525% of patients were nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, rash, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. This article summarizes the FDA review process and data supporting the approval of sacituzumab govitecan.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33070624\nTitle: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy: An Antibody-Drug Conjugate for the Treatment of Refractory, Metastatic, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sacituzumab govitecan (-hziy; IMMU-132, Trodelvy) for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease. A literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed and MEDLINE databases, applicable published abstracts, and ongoing studies from ClinicalTrials.gov between January 1, 1981, and September 3, 2020. Keywords included <i>sacituzumab govitecan (-hziy), IMMU-132, Trop-2</i> (trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2), and <i>TACSTD2</i>. All English-language trials involving sacituzumab govitecan for mTNBC were included and discussed. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate targeted for Trop-2 and conjugated to the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor SN-38. It was granted accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval based on a phase I/II single-arm, multicenter study (n = 108), which reported an overall response rate of 33.3% and median duration of response of 7.7 months (95% CI = 4.9-10.8 months). Common adverse reactions include nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, rash, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and respiratory infection. A confirmatory, randomized phase III clinical trial is ongoing (NCT02574455). This review covers the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of sacituzumab govitecan, a third-line drug with activity in mTNBC. Sacituzumab govitecan is a novel targeted treatment with promising activity in mTNBC.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32563561\nTitle: The evolving management of metastatic triple negative breast cancer.\nAbstract: Advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an incurable disease classified by its lack of expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. Due to its lack of therapeutic targets, it has historically been treated with single agent chemotherapy, with combination cytotoxic therapy typically reserved for patients with high disease burdens, symptomatic disease, and/or impending visceral crisis. Recent molecular analyses have revealed that this clinical group of TNBCs is in fact quite biologically heterogeneous, with multiple TNBC subtypes defined by distinct biology and clinical behavior. Building on this biology, 2 targeted strategies are now approved for selected patients with advanced TNBC: the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for advanced TNBC with a germline mutation in BRCA1/2, and the combination of the programmed death ligand 1-specific antibody atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel for advanced TNBC that expresses programmed death ligand 1 on immune cells within the tumor. These targeted agents tend to be associated with a more favorable side effect profile and longer disease control than standard chemotherapy. A number of other targeted therapies have shown promise in early clinical trials, and several are now in definitive phase 3 testing for advanced TNBC. These include the antiapoptotic kinase inhibitors ipatisertib and capivasertib, and the antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Approved biomarker-driven treatment options for this disease are thus likely to expand in the near-term. Here we review current treatment options and emerging targeted therapies for advanced TNBC. For patients who do not meet criteria for approved targeted therapies, participation in clinical trials evaluating precision medicines with candidate predictive biomarkers in advanced TNBC should be encouraged.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 33475293, 30786188, 33168656, 33070624, 32563561\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
