                "Score: -2  \nReasoning: \nAll five abstracts consistently show that fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd) improves clinical outcomes in patients with advanced breast cancer, rather than worsening them. For instance, PMID: 36780610 reports that T-DXd significantly prolonged both progression-free survival and overall survival in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. Similarly, PMID: 33753456 describes an FDA approval for T-DXd based on robust overall response rates and durable responses in HER2-positive disease, supported by overall favorable benefit-risk findings. Other reviews (e.g., PMID: 33629601, PMID: 34077236) reinforce the positive therapeutic profile of T-DXd. Hence, the proposition that treatment with T-DXd worsens outcomes is refuted by the evidence."

Approval was based on DESTINY-Breast04, a phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, determined at a central laboratory. A total of 557 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks (n = 373) or physicians' choice of chemotherapy (n = 184). The study met its primary efficacy end point of progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review assessment in the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cohort (N = 494) with an estimated hazard ratio (HR) of 0.51(95% CI, 0.40 to 0.64; <i>P</i> < .0001). Key secondary end points were also met, including PFS in the intent-to-treat population with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.63; <i>P</i> < .0001), overall survival (OS) in the HR+ cohort with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86; <i>P</i> = .0028) and OS in the intent-to-treat with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.84; <i>P</i> = .0010). The safety profile of T-DXd was consistent with previously approved indications, and no new safety signals were observed in this study population. The approval of T-DXd in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer was based on statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS and OS improvements observed in the DESTINY-Breast04 trial and represents the first approved therapy specifically for the treatment of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 32223669\nTitle: The Evolution of Antibody-Drug Conjugates: A Positive Inflexion Point.\nAbstract: In 2019, an important inflection point occurred when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved three new antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of malignancies, including urothelial cancer (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), and HER2 breast cancer (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki), and expanded the indication for ado-trastuzumab emtansine to early breast cancer. This near doubling in the number of approved ADCs within 1 year validates the ADC platform and represents a successful evolution over the past 30 years. ADCs were born in an era when systemic therapy for cancer was largely cytotoxic chemotherapy. Many of the investigational cytotoxic agents were determined to be too toxic for oral and intravenous use. The agents were especially potent, with inhibitory concentrations that inhibited 50% of cells in the nanomolar and picomolar range but had poor therapeutic indexes when administered systemically. Now, over the last 30 years, we have seen an evolution of the many aspects of this complex platform with better antigen target selection, more sophisticated chemistry for the linkers, a growing diversity of payloads from cytotoxic chemotherapy to targeted therapies and immunostimulants, and, with the recent series of regulatory approvals, a buoyed sense of optimism for the technology. Nonetheless, we have not fully realized the full potential of this platform. In this review, the many components of ADCs will be discussed, the difficulties encountered will be highlighted, the innovative strategies that are being used to improve them will be assessed, and the direction that the field is going will be considered.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33753456\nTitle: FDA Approval Summary: Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-Nxki for the Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: On December 20, 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval to fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki [DS-8201a; T-DXd; tradename ENHERTU (Daiichi Sankyo)] for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. Approval was based on data from study DS8201-A-U201 (DESTINY-Breast01) with supportive safety data from study DS8201-A-J101. The primary efficacy endpoint in DESTINY-Breast01 was overall response rate (ORR) based on confirmed responses by blinded independent central review (ICR) using RECIST v1.1 in all participants who were assigned to receive the recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg while secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR). The confirmed ORR based on ICR in these 184 patients was 60.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 52.9-67.4] and the median DoR was 14.8 months (95% CI: 13.8-16.9). Interstitial lung disease, including pneumonitis, was experienced in patients treated with T-DXd and can be severe, life threatening, or fatal. In addition, neutropenia and left ventricular dysfunction were included as Warnings and Precautions in labeling. Other important common adverse reactions were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, decreased appetite, anemia, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia. Overall, the totality of efficacy and safety data supported the accelerated approval of T-DXd for the intended indication.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 33629601\nTitle: A Review of Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of antibody-drug conjugate fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the treatment of advanced, unresectable, or metastatic breast cancer. Relevant information was identified through a MEDLINE/PubMed (January 2015 to December 2020) literature search. The new drug application, prescribing information, clinical practice guideline, and abstracts from scientific meetings were also reviewed. The literature search was limited to human studies published in the English language. All studies evaluating the pharmacology, efficacy, or safety of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for breast cancer were included. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is composed of an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody and topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd), which causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. Major phase I and phase II clinical trials established the efficacy and safety of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for treatment of HER2-positive advanced, unresectable, or metastatic breast cancers that are refractory or intolerant to standard treatment. In these trials, the response rate was 60.9% (95% CI = 53.4-68.0) Common adverse effects included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, constipation, diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Serious adverse effects included interstitial lung disease or pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, left ventricular dysfunction, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an option for HER2-positive breast cancer following 2 previous lines of HER2-targeted therapy. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer in the metastatic setting, but randomized controlled trials are needed.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 34077236\nTitle: Current and Future Management of HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed and/or amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers, conferring an aggressive tumor behavior but also an opportunity for targeted therapies. In the advanced setting, the prognosis of patients suffering from this disease has greatly improved after the introduction of new anti-HER2 drugs beyond trastuzumab. For most patients, a taxane combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the first-line setting, followed by trastuzumab-emtansine in second line, should be considered the standard of care today. However, chemo-free anti-HER2 strategies in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer could also be considered in selected patients. In the third-line setting and beyond, several emerging anti-HER2 therapies are becoming available, including tucatinib, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (DS-8201a), neratinib, and margetuximab-cmkb. In addition, new compounds and combinations are showing promising results in the late-line setting. The treatment landscape of HER2-positive advanced disease is evolving constantly, active drugs such as pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine are moving to early-stage, many biomarkers, including quantification of HER2 itself, are being explored to improve patient selection, and patient populations with specific needs are emerging, such as those with brain metastasis. Here, we provide an overview of the current and future management of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 36780610, 32223669, 33753456, 33629601, 34077236\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
