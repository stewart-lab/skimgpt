Depending upon the degree of ER agonism/antagonism at the target tissue, SERMs show efficacy for various indications including osteoporosis, dyspareunia, and breast cancer, and are associated with safety risks. This review describes the safety profile of SERMs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, toremifene, bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene, and ospemifene) and fulvestrant (a pure ER antagonist) from Phase III trials, long-term extension studies, and active comparator studies. Tamoxifen, a first-generation SERM, is indicated for breast cancer prevention and treatment but is associated with serious safety concerns including endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolic events (VTE), and stroke. Toremifene, raloxifene, bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene, and ospemifene present generally improved, though distinctly different, safety profiles compared with tamoxifen, especially with endometrial cancer and stroke. However, the risk of VTE remains a concern for most SERMs. Each SERM presents a unique risk/benefit profile based on varying indications and tissue-specific ER agonist and antagonist effects, making careful patient selection and ongoing patient monitoring crucial aspects of treatment. Future research may focus on identifying new SERMs for endocrine-resistant and endocrine-responsive cancers and post-menopausal symptoms.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 14576841\nTitle: Antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer and the role of estrogen receptor signaling.\nAbstract: Antiestrogens include agents such as tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, and fulvestrant. Currently, tamoxifen is the only drug approved for use in breast cancer chemoprevention, and it remains the treatment of choice for most women with hormone receptor positive, invasive breast carcinoma. While antiestrogens have been available since the early 1970s, we still do not fully understand their mechanisms of action and resistance. Essentially, two forms of antiestrogen resistance occur: de novo resistance and acquired resistance. Absence of estrogen receptor (ER) expression is the most common de novo resistance mechanism, whereas a complete loss of ER expression is not common in acquired resistance. Antiestrogen unresponsiveness appears to be the major acquired resistance phenotype, with a switch to an antiestrogen-stimulated growth being a minor phenotype. Since antiestrogens compete with estrogens for binding to ER, clinical response to antiestrogens may be affected by exogenous estrogenic exposures. Such exposures include estrogenic hormone replacement therapies and dietary and environmental exposures that directly or indirectly increase a tumor's estrogenic environment. Whether antiestrogen resistance can be conferred by a switch from predominantly ERalpha to ERbeta expression remains unanswered, but predicting response to antiestrogen therapy requires only measurement of ERalpha expression. The role of altered receptor coactivator or corepressor expression in antiestrogen resistance also is unclear, and understanding their roles may be confounded by their ubiquitous expression and functional redundancy. We have proposed a gene network approach to exploring the mechanistic aspects of antiestrogen resistance. Using transcriptome and proteome analyses, we have begun to identify candidate genes that comprise one component of a larger, putative gene network. These candidate genes include NFkappaB, interferon regulatory factor-1, nucleophosmin, and the X-box binding protein-1. The network also may involve signaling through ras and MAPK, implicating crosstalk with growth factors and cytokines. Ultimately, signaling affects the expression/function of the proliferation and/or apoptotic machineries.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 8402624\nTitle: Major difference in the hepatocarcinogenicity and DNA adduct forming ability between toremifene and tamoxifen in female Crl:CD(BR) rats.\nAbstract: The hepatoproliferative effects of 2 antiestrogens, tamoxifen and toremifene, were compared in a sequential 15-month study in which 2 doses of each compound were administered by daily gavage to female Sprague-Dawley rats for up to 12 months. The doses were 11.3 and 22.6 mg/kg for tamoxifen and 12 and 24 mg/kg for toremifene. There were scheduled sacrifices at 3, 6, 12, and 15 months, the latter including a 3-month recovery period from the 12th through the 14th month. In the chronic toxicity study, tamoxifen at 22.6 mg/kg produced 100% incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma at the 12- and 15-month sacrifice intervals and 67% and 71% incidences at the 11.3-mg/kg dose. Sequential observations showed an increased incidence of glutathione S-transferase-positive foci of hepatocellular alteration by 3 months with tamoxifen in the absence of hepatotoxicity, with the first liver carcinoma appearing by 6 months of treatment. Unscheduled deaths occurring beyond 7.5 months in the tamoxifen treated groups were due in almost all cases to liver cancer. In striking contrast, toremifene did not produce any hepatoproliferative effects at 12- and 24-mg/kg dose levels, nor in a pilot study at 48 mg/kg. The 24-mg/kg dose of toremifene exerted an inhibiting effect on foci of hepatocellular alteration in rat liver detectable by glutathione S-transferase immunohistochemistry at 3 months and by conventional histology at 12 months. An antiproliferative effect was also evident in mammary gland and anterior pituitary where both toremifene and tamoxifen suppressed tumor incidence in comparison to the control group. The ability of these drugs to modify rat liver DNA after p.o. administration was investigated using the 32P-postlabeling assay. Administration of tamoxifen at 45 mg/kg for 7 days produced liver DNA nucleoside modifications represented by 7 spots on the autoradiogram. Unlike tamoxifen, toremifene did not produce any modified bases in rat liver DNA detectable by the 32P-postlabeling technique. The dose levels of tamoxifen that are strongly hepatocarcinogenic in the rat are compared with doses used in humans in various applications. Taking internal drug exposure into account, we conclude that the margin of safety for use of tamoxifen as an endocrine prophylactic agent for healthy, but breast cancer prone, women is questionable.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 11134190\nTitle: Adjuvant clodronate treatment does not reduce the frequency of skeletal metastases in node-positive breast cancer patients: 5-year results of a randomized controlled trial.\nAbstract: Bisphosphonates have effectively reduced the development and progression of bone metastases in advanced breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether bone metastases could be prevented by adjuvant clodronate treatment in patients with primary breast cancer. Between 1990 and 1993, 299 women with primary node-positive breast cancer were randomized to clodronate (n = 149) or control groups (n = 150). Clodronate 1,600 mg daily was given orally for 3 years. All patients received adjuvant therapy: premenopausal six cycles of CMF chemotherapy and postmenopausal antiestrogens (randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg or toremifene 60 mg/d for 3 years). Seventeen patients were excluded from the analyses because of major protocol violations. The final population was 282 patients. Intent-to-treat analyses were also performed for all major end points. The follow-up time was 5 years for all patients. Bone metastases were detected equally often in the clodronate and control groups: 29 patients (21%) versus 24 patients (17%) (P: = .27). The development of nonskeletal recurrence was significantly higher in the clodronate group compared with controls: 60 patients (43%) versus 36 patients (25%) (P: = .0007). The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were also significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the controls (OS, 70% v 83%, P: = .009; DFS, 56% v 71%, P: = .007, respectively). In multivariate analyses, clodronate remained significantly associated with DFS (P: = .009). Adjuvant clodronate treatment does not prevent the development of bone metastases in node-positive breast cancer patients. However, clodronate seems to have a negative effect on DFS by increasing the development of nonskeletal metastases.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\nPMID: 10375015\nTitle: Vascular endothelial growth factors are differentially regulated by steroid hormones and antiestrogens in breast cancer cells.\nAbstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major inducer of tumor angiogenesis and an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Hypoxia is an important inducer of VEGF expression but less is known of the role of hormones in VEGF regulation. We have studied the regulation of VEGF, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D mRNAs in human MCF-7 and mouse S115 breast carcinoma cells stimulated by estrogens and androgens, respectively. VEGF, VEGF-B, and VEGF-C were expressed in both cell lines, whereas VEGF-D was expressed only in S115 cells. Addition of estradiol (E2) caused a biphasic increase of VEGF mRNA in MCF-7 cells and led to accumulation of the VEGF protein in the culture medium. The VEGF-B mRNA was not affected, while a decrease occurred in VEGF-C mRNA. Similarly, testosterone upregulated the expression of VEGF mRNA in the S115 cells. Experiments with actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggested that estrogen induction of VEGF mRNA is dependent on the synthesis of new mRNA and increased mRNA half-life. The antiestrogen ICI 182.780 inhibited E2 stimulation of VEGF, suggesting that the effect was mediated by the estrogen receptor. In contrast, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and toremifene which inhibit MCF-7 cell growth in vivo and in vitro did not inhibit estrogen effect but induced VEGF mRNA expression when used alone. The antiandrogen cyprosterone acetate inhibited T induction of VEGF mRNA in S115 cells, thus suggesting that activation of androgen receptor must be involved in the increase of VEGF mRNA. Our results suggest that both estrogen and androgen stimulate the expression of VEGF by increasing gene transcription and mRNA stability. In addition, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and toremifene also increased VEGF expression. Estrogen and androgen induction of VEGF expression and promotion of new vessel formation may be an important paracrine mechanism by which these hormones contribute to the early phase of tumor growth of hormonal cancer.===END OF ABSTRACT===\n\n\n\nAvailable PMIDs for Citation: 25936229, 14576841, 8402624, 11134190, 10375015\n\nAssessment Task:\nEvaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between Breast Cancer and toremifene. \nThe texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only Breast Cancer and toremifene. \nThe texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above.
