            "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is frequently seen in inflammatory bowel disease. Traditionally, oral iron supplementation is linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. This multicenter phase-3 study tested the efficacy and safety of ferric maltol, a complex of ferric (Fe) iron with maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone), as a novel oral iron therapy for IDA.Adult patients with quiescent or mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, mild-to-moderate IDA (9.5-12.0 g/dL and 9.5-13.0 g/dL in females and males, respectively), and documented failure on previous oral ferrous products received oral ferric maltol capsules (30 mg twice a day) or identical placebo for 12 weeks according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to week 12. Safety and tolerability were assessed.Of 329 patients screened, 128 received randomized therapy (64 ferric maltol-treated and 64 placebo-treated patients) and comprised the intent-to-treat efficacy analysis: 55 ferric maltol patients (86%) and 53 placebo patients (83%) completed the trial. Significant improvements in Hb were observed with ferric maltol versus placebo at weeks 4, 8, and 12: mean (SE) 1.04 (0.11) g/dL, 1.76 (0.15) g/dL, and 2.25 (0.19) g/dL, respectively (P < 0.0001 at all time-points; analysis of covariance). Hb was normalized in two-thirds of patients by week 12. The safety profile of ferric maltol was comparable with placebo, with no impact on inflammatory bowel disease severity.Ferric maltol provided rapid clinically meaningful improvements in Hb and showed a favorable safety profile, suggesting its possible use as an alternative to intravenous iron in IDA inflammatory bowel disease.",
            "Ferric maltol was effective and well-tolerated in iron deficiency anaemia patients with inflammatory bowel disease during a 12-week placebo-controlled trial.To perform a Phase 3 extension study evaluating long-term efficacy and safety with ferric maltol in inflammatory bowel disease patients in whom oral ferrous therapies had failed to correct iron deficiency anaemia.After 12 weeks of randomised, double-blind treatment, patients with iron deficiency anaemia and mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease received open-label ferric maltol 30 mg b.d. for 52 weeks.111 patients completed randomised treatment and 97 entered the open-label ferric maltol extension. In patients randomised to ferric maltol ('continued'; n = 50), mean \u00b1 s.d. haemoglobin increased by 3.07 \u00b1 1.46 g/dL between baseline and Week 64. In patients randomised to placebo ('switch'; n = 47), haemoglobin increased by 2.19 \u00b1 1.61 g/dL. Normal haemoglobin was achieved in high proportions of both continued and switch patients (89% and 83% at Week 64, respectively).

            "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term used to describe a group of chronic, progressive inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types. Fatigue is a common, debilitating and burdensome symptom experienced by individuals with IBD. The subjective, complex nature of fatigue can often hamper its management. The efficacy and safety of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for fatigue in IBD is not yet established through systematic review of studies.To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for managing fatigue in IBD compared to no treatment, placebo or active comparator.A systematic search of the databases Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO was undertaken from inception to July 2018. A top-up search was run in October 2019. We also searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ongoing trials and research registers, conference abstracts and reference lists for potentially eligible studies.Randomised controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in children or adults with IBD, where fatigue was assessed as a primary or secondary outcome using a generic or disease-specific fatigue measure, a subscale of a larger quality of life scale or as a single-item measure, were included.Two authors independently screened search results and four authors extracted and assessed bias independently using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The primary outcome was fatigue and the secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and withdrawal due to AEs. Standard methodological procedures were used.We included 14 studies (3741 participants): nine trials of pharmacological interventions and five trials of non-pharmacological interventions. Thirty ongoing studies were identified, and five studies are awaiting classification. Data on fatigue were available from nine trials (1344 participants). In only four trials was managing fatigue the primary intention of the intervention (electroacupuncture, physical activity advice, cognitive behavioural therapy and solution-focused therapy). Electroacupuncture Fatigue was measured with Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) (scores range from 0 to 52). The FACIT-F score at week eight was 8.00 points higher (better) in participants receiving electroacupuncture compared with no treatment (mean difference (MD) 8.00, 95% CI 6.45 to 9.55; 1 RCT; 27 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results at week 16 could not be calculated. FACIT-F scores were also higher with electroacupuncture compared to sham electroacupuncture at week eight (MD 5.10, 95% CI 3.49 to 6.71; 1 RCT; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) but not at week 16 (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.46; 1 RCT; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported, except for one adverse event in the sham electroacupuncture group. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and solution-focused therapy Compared with a fatigue information leaflet, the effects of CBT on fatigue are very uncertain (Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Fatigue (IBD-F) section I: MD -2.16, 95% CI -6.13 to 1.81; IBD-F section II: MD -21.62, 95% CI -45.02 to 1.78; 1 RCT, 18 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The efficacy of solution-focused therapy on fatigue is also very uncertain, because standard summary data were not reported (1 RCT, 98 participants). Physical activity advice One 2 x 2 factorial trial (45 participants) found physical activity advice may reduce fatigue but the evidence is very uncertain. At week 12, compared to a control group receiving no physical activity advice plus omega 3 capsules, FACIT-F scores were higher (better) in the physical activity advice plus omega 3 group (FACIT-F MD 6.40, 95% CI -1.80 to 14.60, very low-certainty evidence) and the physical activity advice plus placebo group (FACIT-F MD 9.00, 95% CI 1.64 to 16.36, very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal and similar across physical activity groups, although more adverse events were reported in the no physical activity advice plus omega 3 group. Pharmacological interventions Compared with placebo, adalimumab 40 mg, administered every other week ('eow') (only for those known to respond to adalimumab induction therapy), may reduce fatigue in patients with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease, but the evidence is very uncertain (FACIT-F MD 4.30, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.85; very low-certainty evidence). The adalimumab 40 mg eow group was less likely to experience serious adverse events (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 521 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and withdrawal due to adverse events (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.87; 521 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ferric maltol may result in a slight increase in fatigue, with better SF-36 vitality scores reported in the placebo group compared to the treatment group following 12 weeks of treatment (MD -9.31, 95% CI -17.15 to -1.47; 118 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in adverse events (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.18; 120 participants; low-certainty evidence) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effects of interventions for the management of fatigue in IBD are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions can be drawn. Further high-quality studies, with a larger number of participants, are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of therapies. Future studies should assess interventions specifically designed for fatigue management, targeted at selected IBD populations, and measure fatigue as the primary outcome.",
            "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral ferric maltol improves and normalizes hemoglobin (Hb) in patients with IBD.This open-label, randomized Phase 1 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of ferric maltol and its effect on iron indices in IBD patients with iron deficiency (with or without anemia).Iron deficient adult IBD patients received ferric maltol 30, 60, or 90\u00a0mg twice daily during an 8-day period. Pharmacokinetics and iron uptake were assessed on days 1 and 8.Twenty-four patients were included: 13 with Crohn's disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (mean age 39\u00a0years; 67\u00a0% female, mean Hb 13.0\u00a0g/dL; mean reticulocyte Hb content (CHr) 31.9\u00a0pg; mean ferritin 13.9\u00a0\u00b5g/L). Plasma maltol and maltol glucuronide increased rapidly at all doses, reaching maximum plasma concentration (C The key constituents of ferric maltol showed predictable pharmacokinetics, with no accumulation over 7\u00a0days and increased iron uptake and storage over time at 30-90\u00a0mg twice-daily doses."

            "We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on trinitro-benzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in the rats, which condition is considered an experimental Crohn's disease (CD). In rats with TNBS-induced colitis, feeding with an elemental diet (ED) plus 2% n-3 PUEA-rich perilla oil significantly suppressed plasma leukotriene (LT) B4 and ulcer index compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% n-6 PUFA-rich safflower oil (34.2 +/- 12.3 s 63.8 +/- 13.2 pg/ml and 8.8 +/- 12.1 vs 66.4 +/- 33.1, P < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the plasma LTB4 and the ulcer index were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Feeding with ED plus 2% alpha-linolenic acid (A-LA)-rich vegetable oil significantly reduced plasma LTB4 and colonic weight compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenonic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil in this model (61.6 +/- 10.5 vs 85.0 +/- 20.9 pg/ml and 0.83 +/- 0.13 vs 0.96 +/- 0.08g, P < 0.05, respectively). This study suggested that dietary fat manipulation with perilla oil can reduce colonic damage and that this is correlated with the suppression of plasma LTB4. The therapeutic efficacy of A-LA in controlling intestinal inflammation in experimental CD may be superior to that of EPA and DHA.",
            "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, have long been associated with a genetic basis, and more recently host immune responses to microbial and environmental agents. Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis allows one to study the pathogenesis of IBD associated environmental triggers such as stress and diet, the effects of potential therapies, and the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. In this paper, we investigated the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the colonic mucosal inflammatory response to DNBS-induced colitis in rats. All rats were fed identical diets with the exception of different types of fatty acids [safflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), or fish oil (FO)] for three weeks prior to exposure to intrarectal DNBS. Control rats given intrarectal ethanol continued gaining weight over the 5 day study, whereas, DNBS-treated rats fed lipid diets all lost weight with FO and CO fed rats demonstrating significant weight loss by 48 hr and rats fed SO by 72 hr. Weight gain resumed after 72 hr post DNBS, and by 5 days post DNBS, the FO group had a higher body weight than SO or CO groups. Colonic sections collected 5 days post DNBS-treatment showed focal ulceration, crypt destruction, goblet cell depletion, and mucosal infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells that differed in severity among diet groups. The SO fed group showed the most severe damage followed by the CO, and FO fed groups that showed the mildest degree of tissue injury. Similarly, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activity was significantly higher in SO followed by CO fed rats, with FO fed rats having significantly lower MPO activity. These results demonstrate the use of DNBS-induced colitis, as outlined in this protocol, to determine the impact of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.",
            "Fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can alter leukotriene production and hence neutrophil function, factors which may be important in the inflammation of Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore we studied the effect of dietary PUFA on neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation and neutrophil function in the rat.Animals were ad libitum-fed pellet diets containing 9.5% fish oil (menhaden oil, rich in n-3 PUFA) with 0.5% safflower oil, 10% safflower oil (rich in n-6 PUFA) or standard chow (6% fat) for 50 days prior to the study. Weight and circulating leukocyte and total neutrophil counts were identical in all three groups. Neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) perfusion was evaluated by measuring macromolecular uptake of radiolabelled dextran (MW 70,000) and changes in mucosal neutrophil infiltration.The fish oil diet group showed no difference in fMLP-induced permeability changes relative to the Chow Control group. However, the Safflower Oil supplemented diet group had a reduced permeability response (p < 0.01). Mirroring the permeability changes, there was diminished mucosal neutrophil infiltration in the Safflower Oil group following ileal perfusion with fMLP (< .005). Chemotaxis and chemiluminescence, two important neutrophil functions, were also significantly suppressed in the Safflower Oil animals (p < 0.05).The failure of a n-3 PUFA enriched diet to diminish the ileal inflammatory response to a bacterial peptide and suppress neutrophil function in the rat suggests such therapy would not be expected to be highly successful in CD. However, it requires confirmation in man, especially under the more complicated inflammatory conditions found in CD. On the other hand, the decreased neutrophil mediated responses with a high linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) diet warrant further investigation.",
            "The role of enteral nutrition (EN) fat composition in regulating inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) is not clear. There is, moreover, insufficient evidence to guide the choice of EN in CD with any confidence. We have reanalysed the findings of previous studies in a systematic review focussing on the relationship between EN fat content and remission rates (RR).A systematic search with no language restriction was undertaken in Medline and Embase databases supplemented by a manual search in the reference lists of identified studies. The selection criteria were: clinical trial, exclusive EN, adults and CD. Data on the type of EN, its fat composition, achieved RR, and study design were extracted. An established assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the studies.A total of 29 clinical trials are included in this review. The quality of the studies was highly variable. No fewer than 27 formulations of enteral feed were identified including 4 elemental and 23 non-elemental preparations. There was a positive correlation between the total n-6 fatty acid content and response rates, which was significant when expressed as the ratio between n-6 and n-3 fatty acids (r\u00a0=\u00a00.378, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). A non-significant positive trend was founded (r\u00a0=\u00a00.072; p\u00a0=\u00a00.643) between medium chain triglycerides (MCT) delivery as a percentage of the total energy provision and RR. While a non-significant negative trend was reported for the delivery of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.13).

            "Elemental diets (EDs) are effective in treating Crohn's disease. We hypothesize that low dietary fat and amino acids used as the sole nitrogen source are the major contributors for the success of EDs. We examined the influences of the addition of dietary fat and protein to an ED using an indomethacin-induced inflammation model in rat small intestine. In the ED-fed rats, the intestinal damage score was decreased compared with that in the standard chow group with decreasing intestinal permeability. By supplementing an ED with soybean oil (SO), intestinal permeability was increased to a level similar to that of the standard chow group. For this group, the intestinal damage score also increased compared with that of the ED group but did not reach the levels observed in the standard chow group. The addition of dietary proteins (using heat-denatured pancreatin) resulted in intestinal damage scores that were significantly higher than those of the ED+SO-fed group. The dietary protein increased the intestinal damage score. These results suggest that EDs control inflammation by decreasing intestinal permeability and the elimination of dietary proteins.",
            "Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILE) are an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN); however, pure soybean oil emulsion is considered a risk factor for intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). Limited data are available on the effect of different ILEs on the liver during long-term PN, and to our knowledge, no study has evaluated outcomes beyond 12 mo. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of mixed ILEs on liver function during long-term PN.A randomized, open-label clinical trial was performed at the Intestinal Failure Center in Skawina, Poland. Sixty-seven patients (35 F, 32 M; mean age, 53.2 years) receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) due to stable chronic intestinal failure (CIF) were randomized to receive one of the following three ILEs: medium/long-chain triacylglycerides (MCT/LCT), olive oil/soybean oil (OO/SO), or a combination of SO/MCT/OO/fish oil (FO) (SMOFlipid). Patients were followed for 5 y. Liver function was assessed clinically and with biochemical parameters (total bilirubin, serum glutamyl oxalate transaminase, serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase) at baseline and after 24 and 60 mo.The most common etiology for CIF was vascular, followed by Crohn's disease, surgical complications, and radiation enteritis. HPN was effective in improving nutritional status and was associated with low rates of catheter infections and clinical complications. No significant differences were observed between groups in median concentrations serum glutamyl oxalate transaminase, serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, or alkaline phosphatase at 24 or 60 mo. A significant reduction in median bilirubin concentration was observed in the SMOFlipid group at 60 mo compared with baseline (6.8 umol/L; interquartile range, 5.2-8.5 versus 7.7 umol/L; interquartile range, 4.9-12.4; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0138).Mixed ILEs are safe and effective for use in patients on long-term HPN.

            "Heparanase is an endo-beta-D-glucuronidase capable of cleaving heparan sulfate (HS) side chains at a limited number of sites, yielding HS fragments of still appreciable size ( approximately 5-7 kDa). Heparanase activity has long been detected in a number of cell types and tissues. Importantly, heparanase activity correlated with the metastatic potential of tumor-derived cells, attributed to enhanced cell dissemination as a consequence of HS cleavage and remodeling of the extracellular matrix barrier. Similarly, heparanase activity was implicated in neovascularization, inflammation and autoimmunity, involving migration of vascular endothelial cells and activated cells of the immune system. The involvement of heparanase in inflammatory processes of the gastrointestinal tract has not been examined. Here, we utilized immunohistochemical analysis to investigate heparanase expression in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Heparanase expression was not detected in specimens derived from normal colon tissue. In contrast, strong heparanase staining was observed in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, but not in infectious colitis. Interestingly, heparanase staining was primarily observed in epithelial rather than immune cells. Importantly, un-fractionated as well as low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin), which exhibit a strong inhibitory activity towards heparanase, have proven efficacious in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that heparanase is actively involved in these pathologies and thus may be considered as a target for the development of anti-inflammatory therapies.",
            "To report a case of probable acute venous thrombosis caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in a pediatric patient with a normal platelet count after prolonged enoxaparin therapy.An 11-year-old African American female with Crohn's disease developed extensive vena cava thrombosis. Her deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was treated with intravenous unfractionated heparin followed by extended outpatient warfarin therapy. Four months later, the warfarin was stopped and subcutaneous enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg once daily was substituted prior to an elective colonoscopy. She was readmitted 6 weeks later with acute DVT with a platelet count of 233 x 10(3)/mm3, significantly lower than the count of 550-700 x 10(3)/mm3 5 months previously and the count of 433 x 10(3)/mm3 3 months earlier. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies was strongly positive and a d-dimer was elevated at 2.9 mg/L (normal <1.5). She was treated with lepirudin followed by warfarin when repeat d-dimer on day 3 was normal. An ultrasound at that time showed no clot extension, and the platelet count had risen to >300 x 10(3)/mm3. Over the next 4 months, there was no further thrombosis.HIT appears to be rare in the pediatric population, and only a few cases treated with a direct thrombin inhibitor have been reported. This is the first case report to our knowledge of a pediatric patient developing HIT secondary to enoxaparin. An interesting feature of this case is the development of HIT in the face of a normal platelet count, which is rare but has been reported in adults.Pediatric patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin are still at risk for developing HIT. Treatment of HIT should involve the initial use of a direct thrombin inhibitor to manage thrombosis until the platelet count returns to higher values. Once the platelet count returns, warfarin can be used for long-term thrombosis management.",
            "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a set of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with significant morbidity. Generally, IBD patients have twice the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to healthy controls. VTE can occur both, during hospital stay or after discharge. We aimed to assess the incidence among IBD patients who were hospitalized for disease exacerbation.In a retrospective cross-sectional analysis all IBD patients who were admitted with disease exacerbation at Galilee Medical Center and Hadassah Medical Organization were included in the study. Excluding criteria was IBD with already known hypercoagulable state.One-hundred and sixteen patients with 176 admissions due to IBD flare were included in the study. The average age was 38.3\u00b116.3 years. Sixty-six admissions (37.5%) occurred in patients with ulcerative colitis exacerbation and 110 in patients with Crohn's disease exacerbation (62.5%). Thirty-nine patients (22.1%) were smokers. Fifty-four patients (30.7%) and 68 patients (38.6%) were on previous (within 3 months) biological and steroid treatment, respectively. Twelve patients (6.8%) were on prophylactic subcutaneous anticoagulation (enoxaparin) throughout their hospital stay and only 3 patient (1.7%) developed in-hospital clinical VTE episode. The mean hospitalization length was 6.8\u00b17.9 days and among patients who developed VTE episode, the length of stay was significantly higher as compared to patients without VTE episodes (36.7 vs. 6.3 days, P<0.0001). Notably, in-hospital IBD related-surgical procedure was the only risk factor for the development of VTE (Odds Ratio: 36.2; P=0.01).In-hospital VTE is rare among IBD patients admitted with exacerbation. Further studies are warranted to assess risk factors for in-hospital VTE development and to assess further the role of prophylactic anticoagulation among IBD patients with bloody diarrhea.",
            "Introduction Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) are considered among the commonest gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases manifesting with chronic, recurring episodes of gut inflammation, especially in the colon. Each disease has its pattern, symptoms, severity of pain, extension, management, and prognosis. However, these diseases share most of the various complications, including the GI tract and extending it to other systems such as musculoskeletal, skin, liver, and pulmonary systems. Objectives We aim to identify the demographic data, prevalence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and management (medications given and investigations ordered) of thromboembolic events (TEE) among inflammatory bowel disease patients at King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH) in Buraydah, Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. All included patients with IBD who meet the inclusion criteria between January 2020 and January 2022 in KFSH were reviewed, and data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results A total of 187 participants were included in the current study. The mean age of the participants \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) was 28.7 \u00b1 10.8 years old. Of the participants, 107 (57.2%) were males. A total of 121 (64.7%) participants were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD), 56 (29.9%) with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10 (5.3%) with both CD and UC. In 156 (83%) participants, the\u00a0duration of the disease was 1-5 years. Among the IBD\u00a0patients, two (1.1%) had TEE in the interval resolution\u00a0middle and left portal vein, as well as the inferior mesenteric vein. The majority of the participants (73.3%) were with no history of comorbid conditions. The most reported clinical symptoms were chest pain\u00a0as reported by 3.2% of the participants. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was the most reported method of diagnosis as reported by 35.8% of the participants. Of the participants, 8.6% used heparin prophylactically, 0.5% used heparin as a treatment, and 0.5% used enoxaparin as a treatment. Moreover, 20.3% of the participants used prophylactic treatment, whereas about 79.7% did not use prophylactic treatment. Old age, extensive disease, colorectal surgery, and pregnancy were not found to be associated with thromboembolic events (p = 1.000, 0.400, 0.164, and 0.053, respectively). Age, gender, and nationality were not significantly associated with thromboembolic events (p = 0.915, 1.000, and 1.000, respectively). Conclusion Despite IBD being one of the emerging health concerns in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u00a0records showed that the prevalence of thromboembolic events was found to be lower when compared to the prevalence reported in the relevant multinational studies. The was no difference in factors affecting the development of thromboembolic events between IBD patients and the general population. Recommendations We should stress raising awareness of IBD patients about their condition, the increased risks of developing thromboembolic events, and the proper prevention methods.",
            "In Japan, Crohn's disease (CD)-related cancers occur most frequently in the anal canal. Many patients with advanced CD-related cancer require total pelvic exenteration (TPE) based on their medical history, and choosing the most effective method for urinary diversion is a major concern. We herein report the first case of CD-related cancer treatment with urinary diversion using a gastric conduit after TPE in Japan.A 51-year-old man with a 25\u00a0year history of CD was referred to our institution after having been diagnosed with fistulae between the rectum and urethra. Sigmoidoscopy revealed stenosis of the anal canal, and histological examination of this lesion led to a diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the tumor had invaded the prostate and left internal obturator muscle, and TPE with left internal obturator muscle resection was planned. Urinary diversion was performed with a gastric conduit. The gastric conduit was created by trimming a gastric tube to a 1.5\u00a0cm width via stapled resection of the greater curvature, and the branches of the right gastroepiploic artery were preserved as feeding vessels. The ureters were raised from the mesentery on the right side of the ligament of Treitz. Ureterogastric anastomosis was performed using the Wallace technique, and the entire anastomosis was then retroperitonealized. The anastomotic site had a bleeding tendency, but hemostasis was obtained by proton pump inhibitor administration and discontinuation of enoxaparin, which had been administered to prevent venous thrombosis. No other major complications occurred, and the patient's quality of life was recovered 6\u00a0months after surgery.Urinary diversion using a gastric conduit is a feasible treatment option for patients with CD-related anorectal cancer requiring TPE.",
            "Recommendations regarding venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients admitted to the hospital for IBD continue to evolve.This study aimed to determine the 90-day rate and risk factors of deep venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism in cohorts of patients with IBD admitted to medical and surgical services.This was a retrospective review.The study was conducted at a quaternary IBD referral center.The study included adult patients ( > 18 y of age) with a known diagnosis of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease who had an inpatient hospital admission for IBD between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2020.The primary outcome measures were 90-day rate of deep venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism among admitted patients.A total of 86,276 hospital admissions from 16,551 patients with IBD occurred between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2020. A total of 35,992 patients (41.7%) were given subcutaneous heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and 8188 patients (9.49%) were given enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during the inpatient hospital admission. From the date of hospital admission, the 90-day rate of deep venous thromboembolism was 4.3% (n = 3664); of these, 1731 patients (47%) were diagnosed during the admission and 1933 patients (53%) were diagnosed after discharge. From the date of hospital admission, the 90-day rate of pulmonary embolism was 2.4% (n = 2040); of these, 960 patients (47%) were diagnosed during admission and 1080 patients (53%) were diagnosed after discharge.The study was limited by its retrospective nature and unmeasured severity of the disease.Patients admitted for IBD had a 90-day deep venous thromboembolism event rate of 4.3% and pulmonary embolism event rate of 2.4%. More than half of the events occurred after discharge, and venous thromboembolism events were higher among patients with IBD admitted to a medical service than those admitted to a surgical service.

            "The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.",
            "Macrophages (MPs) produce increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in Crohn's disease; these cytokines are thought to play a central role in the occurrence of the disease. Biologics are currently available for anti-cytokine therapy, but treating intestinal inflammation through direct suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production could be more effective. P-ATPase inhibitors have been reported to be anti-inflammatory, and these inhibitors might suppress the production of MP proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we examined the effect of two types of ATPase inhibitors on the expression patterns of typical proinflammatory cytokines. Peritoneal MPs from 6- to 8-week-old mice were cultured for 48 h in the presence of lansoprazole (P-ATPase inhibitor), bafilomycin A(1) (V-ATPase inhibitor), or the control solvent dimethylsulfoxide. The MPs were then examined for cytokine expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and culture supernatants were examined for cytokine production with a multiplex assay in a suspension array system. The possible existence of P-ATPase mRNA in MPs was explored using reverse-transcriptase PCR. P-ATPase mRNA was not detected in MP cells. However, all examined proinflammatory cytokines decreased significantly in their mRNA and protein expression in the lansoprazole-treated group. Conversely, bafilomycin A(1) increased the levels of these cytokines. Lansoprazole might be useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease, as it suppresses the production of relevant MP proinflammatory cytokines. However, because P-ATPase was not detected in MPs, the mechanism is unclear and remains to be studied further in an IBD animal model."

            "Bile acid diarrhea (BAD) is usually seen in patients with ileal Crohn's disease or ileal resection. However, 25% to 50% of patients with functional diarrhea or diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) also have evidence of BAD. It is estimated that 1% of the population may have BAD. The causes of BAD include a deficiency in fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), a hormone produced in enterocytes that regulates hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis. Other potential causes include genetic variations that affect the proteins involved in BA enterohepatic circulation and synthesis or in the TGR5 receptor that mediates the actions of BA in colonic secretion and motility. BAs enhance mucosal permeability, induce water and electrolyte secretion, and accelerate colonic transit partly by stimulating propulsive high-amplitude colonic contractions. There is an increased proportion of primary BAs in the stool of patients with IBS-D, and some changes in the fecal microbiome have been described. There are several methods of diagnosing BAD, such as (75)selenium homotaurocholic acid test retention, serum C4, FGF-19, and fecal BA measurement; presently, therapeutic trials with BA sequestrants are most commonly used for diagnosis. Management involves the use of BA sequestrants including cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam. FXR agonists such as obeticholic acid constitute a promising new approach to treating BAD."

            "The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose is a drug used to treat type II diabetes mellitus. It occasionally causes diarrhea. Acarbose related colitis has been reported. This note explains how such side effects may occur. Because of small intestine alpha-glucosidase inhibition, increased starch reaches the colon. Increased colonic starch allows the flora to generate increased butyrate. Absorbed butyrate causes up-regulation of prostaglandin E series production and the latter generates water and electrolyte loss. A colitis results when this acarbose driven process is extreme. Acarbose should be avoided in pregnancy until above can be disproved due to teratogenic and labor inducing potential of prostaglandin E. A theoretical reason for avoiding acarbose in Crohn's disease is presented. Despite these considerations, acarbose remains a safe medicine and may even have salutary intestinal consequences stemming from the same physiology as outlined here.",
            "Lactulose is therapeutically used in hepatic encephalopathy, constipation, and salmonellosis. This semisynthetic disaccharide is neither metabolized nor absorbed in the normal small intestines. Comparable to plant-polysaccharides lactulose is bacterially fermented in the colon to short chain fatty acids and gases. Major consequences are a drop in pH and a change in composition and metabolic activity of the colonic flora. These and other potential effects suggest complex mechanisms of action of lactulose, with the potential for additional indications in diagnosis and therapy. The use of lactulose as substrate for the H2-breath-test is well known as a means for the measurement of oroeceal transit time and as test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. An extension of the diagnostic potential is given by the assessment of the permeability in diffuse intestinal disease with combined disaccharide/monosaccharide test solutions, especially in Crohn's disease. Explanations for positive effects in the prophylaxis of cholesterol-gallstones, in the therapy of hypercholesterolemia and in the prevention of colorectal adenoma and carcinoma can be found in changes in lipid- and bile acid metabolism found after lactulose ingestion. Lactulose may lead to an improved glucose-tolerance in parallel to fibre and acarbose effects which involve several mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolism. Lactulose presumably reduces pathogenic bacteria in favor of the health promoting bifidusflora; also, production and absorption of endotoxines may be reduced; this suggests that lactulose may have therapeutic effects on both infectious and idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases. Numerous studies with interesting but not as yet convincingly documented clinical relevance suggest that the many effects of lactulose may be interesting subjects for future research."

This suggests that EVANS BLUE could be useful in diagnosing or monitoring the progression of Crohn's disease by evaluating lymphatic function. Therefore, the relationship between EVANS BLUE and Crohn's disease is more diagnostic than therapeutic based on the information provided in the abstract."

            "Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Leukotriene B4 is thought to be a prominent proinflammatory mediator in these diseases, in that leukotriene B4 levels are increased in the colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients and there is increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of these tissues. We evaluated the efficacy of 7-[3-(4-acetyl-3-methoxy-2-propylphenoxy)-3,4-dihydro-8-propyl -2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (SC-41930), a potent, orally active leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic mucosal inflammation was induced in rats, guinea pig and rabbits by rectal instillation of a dilute solution of acetic acid. Twenty-four hours later, mucosal levels of myeloperoxidase (a marker enzyme for neutrophil infiltration) and extravasation of i.v. administered Evans blue dye (a marker of vascular disruption and increased permeability) were measured. Tissues were also evaluated histologically. The animals received either SC-41930 or vehicle, intrarectally, 30 min after or 1 hr before and 1 hr after the acetic acid. When given 30 min after acetic acid instillation SC-41930 prevented the rise in myeloperoxidase and dye extravasation observed in the acetic acid inflammed tissue. The SC-41930-treated tissues were less edematous and had fewer neutrophils within the subepithelial space. Median effective dose (ED50) values for vascular protection were approximately 20 mg/kg for both rat and guinea pig. ED50 values for inhibition of granulocyte accumulation were 20 mg/kg for rat, 24 mg/kg for guinea pig and 30 mg/kg for rabbit. These data indicate that SC-41930 is effective locally to prevent acute colonic inflammation.",

Apelin, a newly identified adipokine, has been demonstrated to be crucial in the development and stabilization of LVs. We aimed to identify the expression of apelin in MAT of CD patients and explore whether apelin influences the disease course in murine colitis and determine its contributions to LVs. Expression of apelin in MAT specimens from patients with CD (n\u202f=\u202f24) and without CD (control, n\u202f=\u202f12) was detected. Il-10 deficient (Il-10",

            "Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have provided promising applications for Crohn's disease (CD). However, the practical efficacy of ADSCs remains controversial, and their mechanism is still unclear. Based on the pathogenesis of dysregulated immune responses and abnormal lymphatic alterations in CD, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) is thought to be a favourable growth factor to optimize ADSCs. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs and their dual mechanisms in both inhibiting inflammation \"IN\" and promoting inflammation \"OUT\" in the intestine.Human stem cells isolated from adipose tissues were identified, pretreated with or without 100\u00a0ng/ml VEGF-C and analysed for the secretion of cell culture supernatants in vitro. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were treated with ADSCs-conditioned medium or co-cultured with ADSCs and VEGF-C stimulated ADSCs. Changes in LECs transmigration, and VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 mRNA levels were assessed by transwell chamber assay and qRT-PCR. ADSCs and VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs were intraperitoneally injected into mice with TNBS-induced chronic colitis. ADSCs homing and lymphatic vessel density (LVD) were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. Lymphatic drainage was assessed using Evans blue. Cytokines and growth factors expression was detected respectively by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The protein levels of VEGF-C/VEGFR-3-mediated downstream signals and the NF-\u03baB pathway were assayed by western blot. Faecal microbiota was measured by 16S rRNA sequencing.ADSCs stimulated with VEGF-C released higher levels of growth factors (VEGF-C, TGF-\u03b21, and FGF-2) and lower expression of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6) in cell supernatants than ADSCs in vitro (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Secretome released by VEGF-C stimulated ADSCs exhibited a stronger LEC migratory capability and led to elevated VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 expression, but these effects were markedly attenuated by VEGFR-3 inhibitor. VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs homing to the inflamed colon and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) can exert stronger efficacy in improving colitis symptoms, reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, and significantly enhancing lymphatic drainage. The mRNA levels and protein concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors were markedly increased with decreased proinflammatory cytokines in the mice treated with VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs. Systemic administration of VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs upregulated the colonic VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway and activated downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation signalling, accompanied by decreased NF-\u03baB p65 expression. A higher abundance of faecal p-Bacteroidetes and lower p-Firmicutes were detected in mice treated with VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs (all P\u2009<\u20090.05).VEGF-C-stimulated ADSCs improve chronic intestinal inflammation by promoting lymphatic drainage and enhancing paracrine signalling via activation of VEGF-C/VEGFR-3-mediated signalling and inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Our study may provide a new insight into optimizing ADSCs treatment and investigating potential mechanisms in CD."

            "Acquired von Willebrand's disease or syndrome (AVWS) is a rare bleeding disorder distinguished from congenital von Willebrand's disease by age at presentation and absence of personal and family history of bleeding disorders. We report on 22 patients with AVWS seen over 25 years. Mean age at diagnosis was 61.3 years (range 38-86 years); most patients had a spontaneous or a post-operative hemorrhage at presentation. Gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis were the most common spontaneous symptoms. Bleeding time was prolonged in most patients, associated with marked reductions in plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity. Plasma VWF multimer distribution was normal (type 1 pattern) in 5 patients, indeterminate (no multimers detectable) in 6 patients (type 3 pattern), and abnormal (decreased higher-molecular-weight multimers, type 2 pattern) in 11 patients. None of 17 patients tested had an inhibitor of ristocetin cofactor activity. An underlying malignant or benign hematologic disease was found in 18 patients, and 1 patient had Crohn's disease. Desmopressin was effective in only half the patients so treated, but all patients responded to treatment with VWF-containing concentrates. Resolution of AVWS occurred with therapy of lymphoma (1 patient) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1 patient). Sixteen patients were alive at last follow-up; no deaths were related to bleeding. AVWS may be more prevalent than has been appreciated; we estimate up to 0.04%. Awareness of the existence of AVWS is essential for diagnosis and appropriate management. Therapy of associated diseases may improve the bleeding disorder.",

            "The development of an effective vaccine is a powerful tool to contain the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Still, it raises potential safety concerns about the subsequent enhancement of associated immunopathology. Increasing evidence shows that the endocrine system, including the hypophysis, may be involved in COVID-19. Moreover, occasional but increasing reports of endocrine disorders involving the thyroid have been reported after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Among them, a few cases encompass the pituitary. Here we report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.We report a 59-year-old female\u00a0patient with a 25-year history of Crohn's disease in long-term remission, who presented with sudden onset of polyuria eight weeks after administration of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with isolated central diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed involvement of the infundibulum and the posterior hypophysis. Eighteen months after the vaccination, she is still under desmopressin treatment and had stable pituitary stalk thickening on magnetic resonance imaging. Although Crohn's disease-associated hypophysitis has been reported, it is scarce. In the absence of other recognizable causes of hypophysitis, we believe the involvement of the hypophysis in our patient may have been triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.We report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Further studies are needed to understand better the mechanisms underlying autoimmune endocrinopathies development in the context of COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."

A consensus has now been reached on the importance of five domains: physical, mental, social and role functioning, and general health perception. Questionnaires are generally accepted as convenient tools, particularly when they include an assessment of general health and disease specific questions. In gastroenterology, chronic disease (e.g. Crohn's disease) and prolonged discomforts are ideal fields for QoL studies, and QoL data should be obtained in therapeutic trials. In duodenal ulcer (DU), the long-term nature of treatments and psychological status of patients make QoL studies of major interest, as exemplified by the nizatidine model."

            "In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol, pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However, using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and possible future chemopreventive strategies.",
            "Chronic inflammation is a key player in pathogenesis. The inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a well known inflammatory protein, and has been a therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's Disease. Obesity is a well known risk factor for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes melitus. Adipose tissue has been shown to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which has the ability to reduce insulin secretion and induce insulin resistance. Based on these observations, we sought to investigate the impact of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid in the presence of TNF-alpha in terms of insulin production, the molecular mechanisms involved and the in vivo effect of a diet high in oleic acid on a mouse model of type II diabetes, KKAy.The rat pancreatic beta cell line INS-1 was used as a cell biological model since it exhibits glucose dependent insulin secretion. Insulin production assessment was carried out using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and cAMP quantification with competitive ELISA. Viability of TNF-alpha and oleic acid treated cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. PPAR-gamma translocation was assessed using a PPRE based ELISA system. In vivo studies were carried out on adult male KKAy mice and glucose levels were measured with a glucometer.Oleic acid and peanut oil high in oleic acid were able to enhance insulin production in INS-1. TNF-alpha inhibited insulin production but pre-treatment with oleic acid reversed this inhibitory effect. The viability status of INS-1 cells treated with TNF-alpha and oleic acid was not affected. Translocation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor transcription factor to the nucleus was elevated in oleic acid treated cells. Finally, type II diabetic mice that were administered a high oleic acid diet derived from peanut oil, had decreased glucose levels compared to animals administered a high fat diet with no oleic acid.Oleic acid was found to be effective in reversing the inhibitory effect in insulin production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. This finding is consistent with the reported therapeutic characteristics of other monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, a diet high in oleic acid, which can be easily achieved through consumption of peanuts and olive oil, can have a beneficial effect in type II diabetes and ultimately reverse the negative effects of inflammatory cytokines observed in obesity and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.",
            "Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits), whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent.We postulated that specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada. Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated.A total of 149 cases and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3 (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats, fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5).Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.",
            "Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.",
            "To assess the value of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) supplementation in addition to amino-salicylic-acid (5-ASA) in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD).Thirty-eight patients (20 males and 18 females, mean age 10.13 years, range 5-16 years) with CD in remission were randomized into two groups and treated for 12 mo. Group I (18 patients) received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+ omega-3 FAs as triglycerides in gastro-resistant capsules, 3 g/d (eicosapentanoic acid, EPA, 400 mg/g, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 200 mg/g). Group II (20 patients) received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+olive oil placebo capsules. Patients were evaluated for fatty acid incorporation in red blood cell membranes by gas chromatography at baseline 6 and 12 mo after the treatment.The number of patients who relapsed at 1 year was significantly lower in group I than in group II (P<0.001). Patients in group I had a significant increase in the incorporation of EPA and DHA (P<0.001) and a decrease in the presence of arachidonic acids.Enteric-coated omega-3 FAs in addition to treatment with 5-ASA are effective in maintaining remission of pediatric CD.",
            "1. Immune response-modulating drugs such as thalidomide may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease (CD). In the present study, we have investigated whether thalidomide exerts this effect by impairing endothelial cell-leukocyte interaction through down-regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory gene products in these cells. 2. Transient CD-like colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by single enema with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) in ethanol followed by macroscopic scoring, histology, intravital microscopy, RT - PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. Thalidomide or its analogue supidimide were administered in olive oil by intragastric instillation 6 h prior to the induction of colitis and then daily for one week. 3. Both thalidomide and supidimide (200 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) significantly attenuated TNBS-induced colitis as compared to vehicle-treated control animals (44 and 37% inhibition, respectively), and this effect persisted for 7 days post cessation of thalidomide treatment (46% inhibition). 4. Moreover, thalidomide significantly reduced leukocyte sticking to postcapillary venular endothelial cells in the submucosa (by 45%), improved functional capillary density and perfusion, and attenuated endothelial interleukin-8 expression, as judged by IHC analysis. According to RT - PCR analysis, both thalidomide and supidimide also significantly reduced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression in the affected part of the descending colon. 5. These findings suggest that thalidomide and one of its derivatives impairs CD-like TNBS-induced colitis in the rat by down-regulating endothelial adhesion molecule and chemokine expression and, as a consequence, the interaction of these cells with circulating leukocytes.",
            "Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) can become a risk factor for intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD). Many ILEs are commercially available, however, a direct comparison of their impact on liver has, to our knowledge, never been performed. The aim of the study was to analyse that clinical problem during long term parenteral nutrition (PN).A randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed at the Intestinal Failure Center in Skawina, Poland. Sixty-seven patients (37 F, 30\u2009M, mean age 53.9 years) enrolled in home parenteral nutrition (HPN) due to stable chronic intestinal failure (CIF) were randomized to receive one the following for 12 months: long-chain triglycerides (LCT), medium/long-chain triglycerides, olive oil/LCT (OO/LCT) and a mix of LCT/MCT/OO/fish oil. Clinical evaluation and biochemical tests (total bilirubin, SGOT, SGTP, GGPT, alkaline phosphatase) were performed at enrolment and after 6 and 12 months.the most common reason for intestinal failure (IF) was short bowel due to mesenteric ischaemia, followed by Crohn's disease, surgical complications and radiation enteritis. PN stabilized liver parameters in all patients. No essential fatty acids deficiency was diagnosed. All four ILEs demonstrated comparable influence on liver in all study periods. The only exception was the decrease in total bilirubin concentration after 12 months (28.1\u2009\u00b1\u200925.3vs 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5, p\u2009=\u20090.0023) and GGTP (222.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009205.8vs 146.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009197.7, p\u2009=\u20090.0079) when OO/LCT was in use.All four ILEs tested may be safe even during long-term parenteral nutrition.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate nutritional habits and dietary attitudes of IBD patients, and to assess their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The study enrolled 50 Crohn's disease and 44 ulcerative colitis patients, with clinical and laboratory parameters taken. Dietary attitudes were examined, and adherence to MD was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Service Score (MDSS).

            "Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILE) are an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN); however, pure soybean oil emulsion is considered a risk factor for intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). Limited data are available on the effect of different ILEs on the liver during long-term PN, and to our knowledge, no study has evaluated outcomes beyond 12 mo. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of mixed ILEs on liver function during long-term PN.A randomized, open-label clinical trial was performed at the Intestinal Failure Center in Skawina, Poland. Sixty-seven patients (35 F, 32 M; mean age, 53.2 years) receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) due to stable chronic intestinal failure (CIF) were randomized to receive one of the following three ILEs: medium/long-chain triacylglycerides (MCT/LCT), olive oil/soybean oil (OO/SO), or a combination of SO/MCT/OO/fish oil (FO) (SMOFlipid). Patients were followed for 5 y. Liver function was assessed clinically and with biochemical parameters (total bilirubin, serum glutamyl oxalate transaminase, serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase) at baseline and after 24 and 60 mo.The most common etiology for CIF was vascular, followed by Crohn's disease, surgical complications, and radiation enteritis. HPN was effective in improving nutritional status and was associated with low rates of catheter infections and clinical complications. No significant differences were observed between groups in median concentrations serum glutamyl oxalate transaminase, serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, or alkaline phosphatase at 24 or 60 mo. A significant reduction in median bilirubin concentration was observed in the SMOFlipid group at 60 mo compared with baseline (6.8 umol/L; interquartile range, 5.2-8.5 versus 7.7 umol/L; interquartile range, 4.9-12.4; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0138).Mixed ILEs are safe and effective for use in patients on long-term HPN. A multicomponent ILE with FO can provide additional benefits in terms of liver function during long-term HPN.",
            "To assess the effect of thalidomide on Trinitrobenzensulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced or oxazolone-induced colitis and discuss the possible mechanism of its action.Transmural colitis was induced by TNBS in three groups of rats (n=6 each), and distal colitis was induced by oxazolone in three groups of rats (n=6 each). Then the rats of the groups were treated with thalidomide [200 mg/(kg x d)], prednisone [5 mg/(kg x d)] or vehicle (olive oil) respectively by oral gavage. The colitis was allowed to run its course for 7 d after gavage and at that time the following endpoints were assessed. Colitis was evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic score; the expression of NF-kappaB P65 was examined by immunohistchemical (IHC); the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was assayed by hybridization in situ (ISH); the cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-4, IFN-gamma were estimated by enzyme-linked immunoadsordent assay (ELISA).With respect to TNBS model, in the control, prednisone-treatment and thalidomide-treatment groups, the macroscopic and microscopic scores were 6.33 +/- 1.03, 1.67 +/- 0.82, 2.00 +/- 0.89 and 7.33 +/- 1.03, 2.67s +/- 0.82, 3.17 +/- 0.75 respectively; the expression levels of NF-kappaB P65 and TNF-alpha mRNA in the three groups were 62.45 +/- 12.38, 23.62 +/- 8.54, 34.18 +/- 9.65 and 12.42 +/- 4.63, 9.86 +/- 3.29, 4.35 +/- 1.74 respectively; the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-4, IFN-gamma were 540.32 +/- 80.76, 94.58 +/- 14.45, 486.18 +/- 68.47; 396.53 +/- 92.42, 78.45 +/- 12.69, 347.56 +/- 82.94; and 385.68 +/- 88.57, 123.68 +/- 38.15, 378.27 +/- 90.65 respectively. The results indicated that thalidomide treatment significantly reduced colonic inflammation, suppressed NF-kappaB activation,enhanced TNF-alpha mRNA degradation, inhibited the synthesis of the TNF-alpha, IEN-gamma and increased the production of IL-4. However, with respect to oxazolone model, the macroscopic score and microscopic score were 2.00 +/- 0.89, 0.33 +/- 0.52, 1.83 +/- 0.75 and 7.83 +/- 1.47, 3.33 +/- 0.82, 6.50 +/- 1.22 respectively. Thalidomide appeared not to be effective in reducing the oxazolone-induced chronic colitis.Thalidomide may be proposed as a useful drug for Crohn's disease, but further work is needed to clarify whether it is an efficacious agent for ulcerative colitis."

Low serum testosterone is associated with an increase in inflammatory factors, while testosterone administration reduces them. There is evidence for an immunomodulatory effect of testosterone on differentiation of regulatory T cells.The research was carried out in clinics in Germany and Syria. The study was a cumulative, prospective, registry study with an increasing number of men over time receiving testosterone. While men diagnosed with Crohn's disease received appropriate treatment for Crohn's disease, they were tested for testosterone deficiency (cut-off point \u226412.1 nmol/L). In total, 92 men received parenteral testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg/12 weeks for up to 7 years. Fourteen men opted not to receive testosterone and served as a comparison group.In men receiving testosterone, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index declined from 239.36\u00b136.96 to 71.67\u00b13.26 at 84 months (p<0.0001 vs. baseline).

            "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause small-bowel inflammation in about 60% of patients receiving these drugs long-term. The inflammation is associated with small intestinal bleeding, protein loss, ulcers and occasionally strictures. Treatment options for NSAID enteropathy include metronidazole, sulphasalazine and misoprostol, and some patients may require surgery. The diagnosis of NSAID enteropathy is not always straightforward. It is especially difficult to differentiate it from the ileitis associated with spondylarthropathy and, at times, that of Crohn's disease. An investigational algorithm is suggested for this purpose. In the last decade a number of small-bowel diseases have been identified, where none were thought to exist, because of the increasing use of enteroscopy and new sensitive tests for intestinal inflammation. Optimal treatments of these conditions are still to be studied.",
            "Inflammatory mediator release is one of the body's responses to tissue injury and inflammation. These mediators, such as interleukin-1 beta (I1-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and products of arachidonic acid metabolism, are themselves proinflammatory. Purified human monocytes stimulated in vitro with E. coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) will release these key cytokines along with various other eicosanoid mediators. Monocytes incubated with LPS and the prostaglandin E-1 analog, misoprostol, released significantly lower levels of cytokines compared to monocytes incubated with LPS alone. Eicosanoid release was also affected by misoprostol. SC-46275, a more potent mucosal protective PGE1 analog, also altered the release of cytokines and eicosanoids from human monocytes. However SC-46275 inhibited I1-1 beta release with an IC50 value of 9 microM compared to 75 microM for misoprostol. SC-46275 and misoprostol both inhibited TNF-alpha release. These data suggest there is a potential immunomodulatory role for prostaglandin analogs in the therapeutic treatment of inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system.",
            "Amtolmetin guacyl (MED15) is a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which shares anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity with the other drugs of the NSAID family but which shows, unexpectedly, strong gastroprotective activity similar to misoprostol. This effect has been attributed to the presence in its molecule of a vanillic moiety responsible for stimulation of capsaicin receptors present throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract. MED15 shows antispasmodic activity in the bowel against a number of agonists and compares favourably with reference compounds. In in vivo indomethacin-induced rat ileitis, MED15 heals better than 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfasalazine, as well as down-regulating intestinal wall myeloperoxidase content. In acetic acid-induced colitis in the rat, levels of malondialdehyde were found to be more markedly reduced with MED15 than with 5-aminosalicylic acid. In contrast with the effect in the stomach, MED15 protective effect in the bowel appears to be unrelated to nitric oxide (NO) production. The MED15 enteroprotective effect is related to stimulation of intestinal capsaicin receptors as demonstrated by the loss of protective effect in the presence of capsazepine, a specific receptor antagonist of capsaicin. In conclusion, following the favourable results obtained in animal models and notwithstanding the pharmacological effects typical of an NSAID, MED15 may rationally be proposed for the treatment of various human colitis conditions and Crohn's disease.",

The target for fenofibrate, PPARalpha, was expressed in lymphocytes, macrophages, and crypt and surface epithelial cells of the colon. The mean number of lymphocytes was decreased by more than 75% in colonic sections of fenofibrate-treated as compared with control IL-10(-/-) mice, and fenofibrate repressed interferon-gamma and IL-17 expression in isolated T cells. Fenofibrate also repressed the expression of the genes encoding 3 chemokines, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL20, and repressed CXCL10 gene promoter activity in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-treated HT-29 cells. In contrast to the beneficial effect of fenofibrate, the PPARdelta ligand GW0742 accelerated the onset of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice.The immunopathology observed in IL-10(-/-) mice resembles that seen in Crohn's disease.

            "'Classification': FAMOTIDINE is potentially harmful for treating Crohn's disease.\n'Rationale': The study suggests that histamine, through histamine receptor 2 (H2R), has a suppressive effect on proinflammatory responses to bacterial ligands. Famotidine, an H2R antagonist, was found to reverse this suppressive effect. Furthermore, mice treated with famotidine displayed more severe symptoms, including weight loss, higher disease scores, and increased numbers of mucosal IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 T cells. This suggests that famotidine, by blocking H2R, could potentially exacerbate the inflammatory responses in Crohn's disease, making it potentially harmful for treating this condition.",

            "Histamine is a key immunoregulatory mediator in immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions and chronic inflammatory responses, in particular histamine suppresses proinflammatory responses to bacterial ligands, through histamine receptor 2 (H2R). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of histamine and H2R on bacteria-induced inflammatory responses in patients with IBD.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease, patients with ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls. PBMC histamine receptor expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Cytokine secretion following Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, or TLR-9 stimulation in the presence or absence of histamine or famotidine (H2R antagonist) was quantified. Biopsy histamine receptor gene expression was evaluated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The in vivo role of H2R was evaluated in the T-cell transfer murine colitis model.The percentage of circulating H2R monocytes was significantly reduced in patients with IBD. Histamine effectively suppressed TLR-induced cytokine secretion from healthy volunteer PBMCs but not for PBMCs from patients with IBD. Famotidine reversed this suppressive effect. H1R, H2R, and H4R gene expression was increased in inflamed gastrointestinal mucosa compared with noninflamed mucosa from the same patient and expression levels correlated with proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. Mice receiving lymphocytes from H2R donors, or treated with famotidine, displayed more severe weight loss, higher disease scores and increased numbers of mucosal IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 T cells.Patients with IBD display dysregulated expression of histamine receptors, with diminished anti-inflammatory effects associated with H2R signaling. Deliberate manipulation of H2R signaling may suppress excessive TLR responses to bacteria within the gut.",
            "The stomach and the duodenum are frequent sites of involvement by diminutive lesions in Crohn's disease (CD).To assess mucosal proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in gastroduodenal lesions of CD.13C-Urea breath test and upper endoscopy were performed in 29 CD patients and seven control subjects, and biopsy specimens were obtained from the gastric cardia and the duodenum. Histology and mucosal levels of IL-1beta, IL-8/CXCL8 and RANTES/CCL5 were assessed and compared according to the presence of gastric cardial lesion [bamboo joint-like appearance (BJA)] and duodenal lesion (notched appearance, aphthous erosion and polypoid lesion). In 11 CD patients, these procedures were repeatedly performed after administration of famotidine.H. pylori was less frequently positive in CD patients than in controls (10% vs. 71%, P = 0.003). Prevalence of cardial and duodenal lesion was significantly higher in CD than in controls (59% vs. 0%, P = 0.008 for gastric lesion; 45% vs. 0%, P = 0.034 for duodenal lesion). There were no differences in IL-1beta, IL-8 and RANTES between CD and controls. Duodenal mucosal IL-1beta and IL-8 were significantly higher in positive duodenal lesion than in negative duodenal lesion. However, there were no such differences with respect to cardial lesions. Endoscopic findings remained unchanged after administration of famotidine, while there was a trend towards decreases in IL-1beta and IL-8 in the gastric cardia.The pathogenesis of diminutive lesions of CD may be different between the stomach and the duodenum. Famotidine may not have a therapeutic effect on duodenal lesion in CD.",
            "A case of infusion-related angioedema associated with the use of an infliximab biosimilar (infliximab-abda) is reported in order to bring awareness that this adverse effect is still highly possible in biosimilars, similar to the reference infliximab biologic.A 37-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for ileocolonic fistulizing Crohn's disease, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presented to an emergency department with shortness of breath, urticaria, and tongue swelling that had developed shortly after initiation of an infusion of infliximab-abda. The patient had no documented allergies at the time of presentation. The patient was taking oral budesonide 9 mg daily and oral azathioprine 50 mg daily for treatment of Crohn's disease. Other medications included oral omeprazole 40 mg every morning for GERD and oral sertraline 100 mg daily for depression. The patient's tongue swelling worsened, and he was intubated for airway protection. The patient received supportive care treatment for angioedema with intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 8 mg every 8 hours, IV diphenhydramine 50 mg every 8 hours, and IV famotidine 20 mg every 12 hours. He was extubated approximately 43 hours later and observed overnight in a medical intensive care unit. He was transferred to a general medicine unit the next day for further care. The total hospital length of stay was 4 days.A 37-year-old man developed infusion-related angioedema with use of infliximab-abda. Discontinuation of the biosimilar product along with supportive care brought about resolution of angioedema. There are no prior published reports of infusion-related angioedema reactions secondary to infliximab-abda use.",
            "A 29-year-old woman was hospitalized with a 1-month history of postprandial epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. An upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray series showed a marked narrowing of the pyloric region. A histological examination of duodenal mucosal biopsy samples showed granulomatous inflammation, and thus a diagnosis of intrinsic duodenal Crohn's disease was made. A second upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray revealed a persistent gastric outlet obstruction. At laparotomy, the duodenal wall was found to be thickened over a distance measuring 3.5 cm in length from the pyloric ring. A longitudinal incision was made over the entire length, up to 5.5 cm beyond the pyloric ring on either side, while Finney-type anastomosis was also performed. A postoperative upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray showed an improvement in the gastroduodenal passage. Enteral nutrition therapy was provided postoperatively. Omeprazole was administered at a dose of 20 mg/day for 2 months. The patient currently remains on maintenance therapy with famotidine at 20 mg/day and is clinically doing well."

            "A prospective study was carried out on 41 patients diagnosed as having Crohn's disease (CD) to evaluate the degree of upper gastrointestinal tract involvement. In 23 patients (56%), endoscopic alterations were found most frequently affecting the antrum and duodenum. Lesions encountered were: Aphthoid erosions, ulcers, thickening of folds, nodules, erythema and stenosis. Granulomas were found in biopsies in 19.5% of the patients: They were more frequent in those demonstrating endoscopic alterations (26%) than in those with normal endoscopic findings (11%). Clinical evolution was favorable with conventional treatment for CD and ranitidine, although the endoscopic lesions did not totally disappear in any cases. We conclude that upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies is useful in evaluating the extension of disease and can be of diagnostic value in cases of indeterminate colitis.",
            "The protective action of zinc compounds in Crohn's disease-like inflammatory bowel disease in animals has been shown. A similar action of zinc sulfate on ulcerative colitis has not been defined. The present study aimed to delineate the protective action of zinc sulfate and the pathogenic mechanisms of 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Zinc sulfate at different concentrations was given either orally (p.o.) or rectally (p.r.) to rats at 42, 48, 66 and 72 h following the induction of colonic inflammation by DNBS. Rats were killed 96 h after instillation of DNBS rectally to assess the severity of colonic damage, myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase activities. The involvement of mast cell degranulation and histamine release in the pathogenesis of DNBS-induced colitis was determined by using a mast cell stabilizer (ketotifen) and histamine receptor blockers (terfenadine and ranitidine). DNBS given rectally produced inflammation and ulceration in rats with a pathology resembling ulcerative colitis. Myeloperoxidase activity but not xanthine oxidase activity was sharply increased by this agent. Intrarectal administration of zinc solution and parenteral injection of histamine blockers significantly reduced tissue damage and myeloperoxidase but not xanthine oxidase activity. Ketotifen, a mast cell stabilizer, also significantly decreased mucosal injury and myeloperoxidase activity in the colon. In conclusion, mast cell degranulation followed by histamine release plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DNBS-induced ulcerative colitis. Zinc given rectally has a therapeutic effect against this colitis model, perhaps through the reduction of inflammation and inhibition of the above pathogenic mechanisms.",
            "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, affecting about 2% of the population. Most cases of Meckel's diverticula are asymptomatic. The diagnosis of symptomatic MD is often difficult to make. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy who presented with GI bleeding due to MD. The diagnostic difficulties after an initial negative endoscopic evaluation and the diagnostic value of the various endoscopic procedures are discussed. The patient had suffered from bright red stools for 20 h before hospital admission. GI scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-Na-pertechnetate was negative for heterotopic gastric tissue in the small bowel area. Colonoscopy performed in order to exclude Crohn's disease was also negative. He was placed on ranitidine at a dose of 6 mg/kg body weight twice daily. The patient remained asymptomatic over a period of 6 months before he was readmitted due to macroscopic rectal bleeding. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy used to investigate the source of bleeding showed normal macroscopic findings. Radiolabeling of blood constituents with (99m)Tc on delayed imaging showed radionucleotide concentration in the ascending and transverse colon suggestive of a lesion in the ileocecal area. Further investigation with the use of wireless capsule endoscopy revealed a MD. Wireless capsule endoscopy may thus be indicated for patients with GI blood loss when other diagnostic methods, such as upper and lower endoscopy and colonoscopy, have failed to identify the source of bleeding.",
            "A patient with a jejunostomy 100 cm from the duodeno-jejunal flexure, following surgery for Crohn's disease, had needed parenteral fluids at home for 14 years because of a negative intestinal balance of sodium. Measurements were made of her oral intake and intestinal output during study periods each of 2 days. Loperamide 4 mg QDS, codeine phosphate 60 mg QDS and both together put her into positive intestinal fluid balance but sodium balance remained negative. Both drugs used together were more effective than either used alone. Ranitidine 300 mg BD made no significant difference to her intestinal output. 1 litre of a glucose-electrolyte solution (120 mmol sodium) sipped during the day resulted in sodium balance, but only with the addition of loperamide and codeine phosphate was positive sodium balance achieved (mean 44 mmol/day). This therapy allowed her to dispense with parenteral fluids which have been stopped for the last year.",
            "Eleven patients with Crohn's disease in remission who were receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) underwent continuous intragastric 24-h pH monitoring before and during ranitidine administration. The patients were randomly allocated to receive 200 mg/day (group 1) or 400 mg/day (group 2) of ranitidine by continuous infusion. The mean basal 24-h gastric pH was sustained at a low value. After raintidine administration, the mean pH increased significantly both in group 1 (from 2.13 to 3.28) and in group 2 (from 1.91 to 3.36), with the mean holding-time at pH-3 also increasing significantly in both groups. There were no differences in the mean pH or holding-time at pH-3 between the two groups during ranitidine administration; however, the plasma ranitidine concentration was significantly higher in group 2. These findings indicate that the continuous infusion of a standard dose of ranitidine exerted a maximal inhibitory effect on the sustained hyperacidity induced by TPN, but that this infusion was unable to maintain the intragastric pH level at above 3.5.",
            "A 72-year-old man with Crohn's disease for about 6 years was urgently hospitalized in hypovolaemic shock. On admission, serum creatinine concentration was 4.2 mg/dl, serum sodium 124 mmol/l, as a result of massive fluid and electrolyte loss via a loop ileostomy which had been placed 4 weeks previously because of a complicated perianal fistula. The basic aetiology of the diarrhoea probably lay in the previous resection of 30 cm of terminal ileum, other possible causes having been excluded. The ileostomy diarrhoea persisted despite the administration of loperamide, ranitidine, glucocorticoids, opium and pancreatic enzymes. Metronidazole, given in case the diarrhoea was due to a change in bacterial flora, also failed to achieve improvement. But when the somatostatin analogue octreotide was administered, the fluid loss via the ileostomy was quickly reduced so that both fluid and electrolyte infusions could be stopped. In subsequent months the initially required daily octreotide dosage of three times 100 micrograms could be reduced to once 50 micrograms subcutaneously. But it was not possible to stop this drug completely: it has now been continued and well tolerated for 2 years.",
            "A 33-year-old man was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2001, and treated with mesalazine and ranitidine. Administration of infliximab was started in 2007 and led to a decrease in the activity of the Crohn's disease. He was referred to our department in the summer of 2011 following rapid progression of renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine levels increasing from 1.5 mg/dL to 4.3 mg/dL within 2 months. On admission, laboratory findings showed signs of inflammation, anemia, proteinuria, and hematuria. Renal biopsy results indicated the diagnosis of granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Neither clinical manifestations nor laboratory findings were suggestive of infectious disease, sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis or tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis. Mesalazine and ranitidine were discontinued in view of reports of drug-induced granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Levels of C-reactive protein immediately decreased, but renal function remained unimproved. Treatment with steroid pulse therapy was then initiated, followed by oral prednisolone at 40 mg/day, and his serum creatinine recovered to 2.3 mg/dL. Mesalazine and/or ranitidine appear to have been responsible for the granulomatous interstitial nephritis. In cases of Crohn's disease showing rapid deterioration of renal function, drug-induced renal disease should be considered, even if the drugs have been taken without apparent problems for a long duration."

            "Women with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) commonly report an increase in their IBD symptoms related to their menstrual cycle. Hormonal contraceptives are safe for women with IBD and frequently used for reproductive planning, but data are lacking on their effect on IBD-related symptoms.We completed a cross-sectional phone survey of 129 women (31% response rate), aged 18 to 45 years, with IBD in an academic practice between March and November 2013. An electronic database query identified eligible women, and we sent an opt-out letter before contact. Questions included demographics, medical and reproductive history, and current/previous contraceptive use. Women were asked if/how their menses affected IBD-related symptoms and if/how their contraceptive affected symptoms. We calculated descriptive statistics and made comparisons by Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis on Stata V11.Participants were predominately white (85%) and college educated (97%), with a mean age of 34.2 (SD 6.2, range 19-45) years. Sixty percent had Crohn's disease, and 30% had IBD-related surgery previously. Half of the participants were parous, and 57% desired future pregnancy. Of the participants, 88% reported current or past hormonal contraceptive use and 60% noted cyclical IBD symptoms. Symptomatic improvement in cyclical IBD symptoms was reported by 19% of estrogen-based contraceptive users and 47% of levonorgestrel intrauterine device users. Only 5% of all hormonal method users reported symptomatic worsening.In a subset of women with IBD, 20% of hormonal contraception users reported improved cyclical menstrual-related IBD symptoms.

            "A large proportion of women of reproductive age in Germany use various methods of pregnancy prevention (contraception), among them various hormone-based methods. Hormonal contraceptives may be divided into combined estrogen-progestogen contraceptives (pills, skin patches, vaginal rings), progestogen-only contraceptives (pills, injections, implants, hormone spirals) and emergency contraceptives.The evaluation addressed the question of benefits and risks of hormonal contraceptives, their economic effects as well as their ethical-social and legal implications.A systematic literature search was conducted in April 2006 starting from 2000. The evaluation is primarily based on systematic reviews.In perfect use, all hormonal contraceptives excluding emergency contraceptives proved to be the most effective reversible contraceptive methods (rate of unintended pregnancies 0.05% to 0.3%). However, the typical use of oral contraceptives, injections, skin patches, and vaginal rings, which also considers possible application errors, showed a lower contraceptive efficacy (rate of unintended pregnancies 3% to 8%). It was lower than that of copper spirals. The risk of venous thromboembolism increased three to six times in users of hormonal contraceptives, the risks of stroke and myocardial infarction two to three times. The risk declined after discontinuation of use. The effects were estrogen-dose and progestogen-type dependent. The use of hormonal contraceptives showed a relative risk of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas of approximately 0.5 or 0.7, of breast and cervical cancer of approximately 1.2 or 1.6. The effect remained several years after discontinuation of use. The results concerning hepatocellular carcinoma suggested a carcinogenic effect. In women with acne, an improvement due to use of hormonal contraceptives was proven. Cervical chlamydial infections were more frequent in users of hormonal contraception. Headache appeared mostly only at the beginning of the use of combined oral contraceptives. Progestogen-only contraceptives worsened the results of the glucose tolerance test. A review of low evidence reported further risks of hormonal contraceptives (concerning menstrual problems, ovarian cysts, bone density, thyroid diseases and rheumatoid arthritis) as well as further benefits (concerning blood pressure and Crohn's disease). Hormonal spirals were shown to be more effective than spirals which do not release hormones. In emergency contraception, Levonorgestrel was more effective than the Yuzpe method. Most other proven differences between hormonal contraceptives were related to menstrual problems. After spirals with or without hormone release, the other hormonal contraceptives were shown in typical use to be the second most cost-effective reversible methods of contraception.The addressed questions could be answered only on relatively low evidence level, partly only for applications with estrogen doses which are not used in Germany any more. The transferability of the results of the analysed primary health-economics studies on the current situation in Germany is limited (clinical assumptions from out-dated information sources of low evidence levels, cost assumptions from the American health system).In perfect use, hormonal contraceptives have to be classified as the most effective reversible contraceptive methods. For the individual decision concerning the use of hormonal contraception, benefits should be related to the additional risks. Alternative methods such as spirals should be prioritised if perfect use seems to be impossible. In this case, spirals are also preferable from health-economics perspective. No ethical-social or legal conclusions can be derived from the available data.In Deutschland verwendet ein gro\u00dfer Teil der Frauen im reproduktiven Alter unterschiedliche Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Schwangerschaftsverh\u00fctung (Kontrazeption), darunter verschiedene Methoden mit Einsatz von Hormonen.

Bei typischer Anwendung, die auch m\u00f6gliche Anwendungsfehler ber\u00fccksichtigt, zeigten allerdings hormonale orale Kontrazeptiva, Injektionen, Pflaster und Vaginalringe eine niedrigere Wirksamkeit (Rate ungewollter Schwangerschaften: 3% bis 8%). Diese war geringer als bei Kupferspiralen. Das Risiko f\u00fcr ven\u00f6se Thromboembolien war bei Anwenderinnen hormonaler Kontrazeptiva drei- bis sechsfach, f\u00fcr Schlaganf\u00e4lle und Myokardinfarkte zwei- bis dreifach erh\u00f6ht und ging nach der Medikamentenabsetzung zur\u00fcck. Das Risiko war von \u00d6strogendosis und Gestagentyp abh\u00e4ngig. Beim Einsatz hormonaler Kontrazeptiva zeigte sich f\u00fcr Ovarial- und Endometriumkarzinome eine ca. 0,5- bzw. 0,7-fache Risikoreduktion, f\u00fcr Brustkrebs und Zervixkarzinom eine ca. 1,2- bzw. 1,6-fache Risikoerh\u00f6hung. Der Effekt blieb einige Jahre nach Medikamentenabsetzung bestehen. Ergebnisse hinsichtlich hepatozellul\u00e4rer Karzinome sprachen eher f\u00fcr einen kanzerogenen Effekt. Bei Frauen mit Akne zeigte sich eine Verbesserung durch hormonale Kontrazeptiva. Zervikale Chlamydieninfektionen traten bei den Anwenderinnen h\u00e4ufiger auf, Kopfschmerzen hingegen meistens nur am Anfang der Anwendung kombinierter oraler Kontrazeptiva. Gestagen-Monopr\u00e4parate verschlechterten die Ergebnisse des Glukosetoleranztests. Nachweise f\u00fcr weitere Nutzen (Menstruationsbeschwerden, Ovarialzysten, Knochendichte, Schilddr\u00fcsenerkrankungen, rheumatoide Arthritis) und weitere Risiken (Blutdruckh\u00f6he, Morbus Crohn) stammen aus einer Publikation niedriger Evidenzebene. Hormonspiralen zeigten sich wirksamer als Spiralen ohne Hormonfreisetzung. Bei Notfallkontrazeption war Levonorgestrel wirksamer als die Yuzpe-Methode. Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen hormonalen Kontrazeptiva bezogen sich meistens auf den Verlauf des Menstrualzyklus. Nach Spiralen mit bzw. ohne Hormonfreisetzung erwiesen sich die anderen hormonalen Kontrazeptiva bei typischer Anwendung als die kostenwirksamsten reversiblen kontrazeptiven Methoden.Die Fragestellungen konnte nur auf relativ niedriger Evidenzbasis beantwortet werden, zum Teil nur f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4parate mit \u00d6strogendosen, die in Deutschland nicht mehr angewendet werden. Die Ergebnisse der ausgewerteten gesundheits\u00f6konomischen Prim\u00e4rstudien sind schlecht auf die aktuelle Situation in Deutschland \u00fcbertragbar (klinische Annahmen aus veralteten Informationsquellen niedriger Evidenzebenen, Kostenannahmen aus dem amerikanischen Gesundheitssystem).Hormonale Kontrazeptiva sind bei perfekter Anwendung als die wirksamsten reversiblen kontrazeptiven Methoden einzustufen. Bei der individuellen Entscheidung \u00fcber eine hormonale Kontrazeption sollen Nutzen und Risiken gegen\u00fcbergestellt werden. Bei Anzeichen, dass perfekte Anwendung nicht m\u00f6glich sein wird, sollten Verh\u00fctungsmethoden in Form von Spiralen oder Hormonimplantaten priorisiert werden. In diesem Fall sind Kontrazeptiva auf Spiralenbasis auch aus gesundheits\u00f6konomischer Sicht zu bevorzugen. Aus den vorhandenen Daten lassen sich keine ethisch-sozialen und juristischen Schlussfolgerungen ableiten."

            "'Classification': NIACIN is potentially useful for treating Crohn's disease.\n'Rationale': The abstract indicates that more than 50% of patients with Crohn's disease in remission had low plasma concentrations of niacin (77%). This suggests that these patients may benefit from increased niacin intake. However, the study does not directly test the effects of niacin supplementation on Crohn's disease symptoms or progression, so it is only potentially useful based on this information. Further research would be needed to confirm the benefits of niacin for treating Crohn's disease.",

The study mentioned in the abstract focuses on the effects of sodium butyrate on an experimental model of Crohn's disease, not NIACIN. Although it is mentioned that GPR109A, a receptor that can be activated by NIACIN, is involved in the study, the specific effects or potential benefits or harms of NIACIN in relation to Crohn's disease are not discussed.

            "The abstract does not provide information on the relationship between NIACIN and Crohn's disease. Therefore, the classification is: 'The relationship between NIACIN and Crohn's disease is unknown.' The rationale for this classification is that the abstract discusses a study on nutrient intake in Crohn's patients and its relationship with Crohn's Activity Index (CDAI), Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and Body Mass Index (BMI), but it does not mention NIACIN at all. Therefore, based on the information provided in the abstract, we cannot determine any relationship between NIACIN and Crohn's disease.",

            "The characteristics of an unclassified Mycobacterium sp. isolated from three patients with Crohn's disease are presented. The organism is extremely fastidious and mycobactin dependent and may require up to 18 months of incubation for primary isolation. Colony morphology is rough. Characteristics are unlike those of any presently defined species. The isolates produced postive niacin, catalase, and 2-week arylsulfatase reactions and were susceptible to neotetrazolium chloride (1:40,000), streptomycin (2 micrograms/ml), and rifampin (0.25 micrograms/ml). Chromogenicity, nitrate reduction, quantitative catalase, Tween hydrolysis, urease, tellurite reduction, pyrazinamidase, and 3-day arylsulfatase tests were negative, and the isolates were resistant to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide (10 micrograms/ml) and isoniazid (10 micrograms/ml). Optimum growth in broth was determined to be in 7H9 medium with Dubos oleic albumin complex, Tween 80, and mycobactin J at 37 degrees C without CO2 or agitation and in low medium depth. This Mycobacterium sp. may be a subspecies or biovariant of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, or it may represent a new species of Mycobacterium. It is suggested that this Mycobacterium sp. may play an etiological role in some cases of Crohn's disease.",
            "Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, especially because of restrictive diets. The aim of our study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in nonselected CD patients in clinical remission.A total of 54 consecutive CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old).According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218 +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P < 0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%).In CD patients in remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However, micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and treatment.",
            "G Protein Coupled Receptor 109A (GPR109A), which belongs to the G protein coupled receptor family, can be activated by niacin, butyrate, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid. Here, we assessed the anti-inflammatory activity of sodium butyrate (SB) on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice, an experimental model that resembles Crohn's disease, and explored the potential mechanism of SB in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

            "Fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) have been identified as triggers for functional gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, excess FODMAP consumption has been implicated in the onset of Crohn's disease, and animal studies suggest that a low glycemic index diet can impair absorption of fructose, a major dietary FODMAP. Such hypotheses cannot be tested without the ability to quantify FODMAP ingestion with a validated dietary assessment tool.To assess the validity and reproducibility of a 297-item comprehensive, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in estimating intake of macro- and micronutrients, FODMAPs, and glycemic index/load.One hundred healthy participants were recruited to complete the FFQ on two occasions, plus four 1-week food diaries kept during a 12-month period. Participants exhibiting major dietary change during the study period or low energy reporting on the FFQ were excluded.Validation and reproducibility of the semi-quantitative FFQ by comparison with the mean of four 1-week food diaries.Validation was assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman's correlation, Bland-Altman, and weighted \u03ba statistics. Reproducibility was examined using Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficient.Seventy-two participants fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographics of the participants were comparable with 2006 Australian Census data. Consistent with other reported FFQs, the FFQ overestimated nutrient intake by a mean 140% (range=95% to 249%). However, based on the other analyses performed, it demonstrated validity for intake of sugars, fiber, alcohol, glycemic index, glucose, FODMAPs, calcium, folate, phosphate, potassium, iron, and magnesium; moderate validation for energy, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sodium, thiamin, sucrose, and retinol; poor validation for protein, mono/polyunsaturated fat, starch, glycemic load, niacin, and zinc. Riboflavin intake was not validated. Intraclass correlation coefficients for reproducibility ranged from 0.352 to 0.928.The FFQ was validated for assessment of a wide range of nutrients, including the new class of carbohydrates, FODMAPs, and glycemic index. This provides a useful tool for dietary research, particularly in the area of gastroenterological disorders.",
            "The primary objective of this study was to explore the macro- and micro-nutrient intakes and dietary patterns of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Secondary objectives were to (a) compare the micronutrient intakes of CD patients with a representative sample of individuals, (b) describe the macro- and micronutrient intakes of male and female CD patients, and (c) describe Mediterranean diet scores (P-MDS) of male and female CD patients in remission that were recruited from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinic in Calgary, AB. Consecutive patients with ileal and/or colonic CD in endoscopic remission were recruited for participation in this cross-sectional study. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled with a mean age of 45, and a Body Mass Index (BMI) \u2265 25. Compared with the representative sample, patients with CD had similar energy, protein, carbohydrate, and total fat intake. However, polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), omega-6 and 3, and monounsaturated fats (MUFA) were lower in CD patients and dietary fiber intake was higher (",
            "Microbiota dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been widely reported. The gut microbiota connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic acid, niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and oleic acid) and medium-chain fatty acids (sebacic acid and isocaproic acid) as well as bile acid was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites. Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in patients with IBD and associated with multi-nutrients, and 21 metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin DThis study provides an interaction network to identify key micronutrients, microbiota components and metabolites that contribute to IBD.",
            "A 47-year-old woman with seronegative polyarthritis, diarrhea, and photosensitivity dermatitis was found to have Crohn's disease and pellagra. The presence of high values of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid in the urine began the exhaustive investigations and finally enterotomy. No mass lesion was found. Argyrophilic cells were not increased in areas of inflamed intestinal mucosa or the normal mucosa. The disagreement between biochemical and histologic findings was attributed to sampling error. Antiinflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease was given and the gastrointestinal and articular symptoms improved, excretion of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid returned to normal and there was no relapse of pellagra. Pellagra as a complication of Crohn's disease has been described in 4 cases; malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption were the proposed mechanisms for the niacin deficiency and pellagra of those patients. In the current case, the pathogenesis of pellagra may be accounted to wastage of tryptophan by an increased pool of intestinal argyrophilic cells, suggested by increased urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid.",
            "Vitamins are micronutrient chemical compounds that cannot be synthesized by an organism but are essential for human metabolism and life. They act as required intermediaries, cofactors or coenzymes in many of the reactions of normal metabolism. In addition, anti-inflammatory effects have been reported for specific vitamins. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), vitamin deficiency is often due to malnutrition (due to a decreased food intake) or malabsorption (due to inflamed, malfunctioning mucosa and diarrhea) which results in anemia. Vitamin B(12) and folic acid supplementation may be necessary in IBD patients, especially those with Crohn's disease (CD) with either inflammation of the terminal ileum or after resection of the terminal ileum. It is also recommended during therapy with sulfasalazine as this compound inhibits the absorption of vitamin B(12). Patients with high or continuous inflammatory CD activity and frequent therapy with steroids have an increased risk of low bone mineral density and vitamin D deficiency. These should be monitored regularly and vitamin D should be supplemented. In a recent trial, a trend towards a reduced risk of relapses in CD patients treated with vitamin D was reported. Only limited studies and case reports exist on other vitamin deficiencies, e.g. vitamins A, B(1), B(2), niacin, B(6), C, E and K, found in IBD patients. These are summarized in this review. Regular nutritional monitoring in IBD patients is warranted and requires the special attention of treating physicians and dieticians.",
            "We aimed to determine the nutrient intake of Crohn's patients and to expose its relationship with Crohn's Activity Index (CDAI), Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and Body Mass Index (BMI).This randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients enrolled in the Gastroenterology Polyclinic of a University Medical Faculty Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey in 2017. Two groups were included in this study: Crohn's Group (n = 100) and Control (n = 89). Crohn's Disease Activity Index was used to detect disease activity. Malnutrition risk was determined by the SGA and daily energy and nutrient intakes were calculated.There was a significant relationship between SGA and both CDAI and BMI (There was a relationship between CDAI, SGD and BMI used to determine nutritional status in patients with Crohn's.",
            "Water-soluble B vitamins participate in numerous crucial metabolic reactions and are critical for maintaining our health. Vitamin B deficiencies cause many different types of diseases, such as dementia, anaemia, cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and HIV. Vitamin B3 deficiency is linked to pellagra and cancer, while niacin (or nicotinic acid) lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides in the blood and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL). A highly sensitive and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) method was developed to detect and quantify a vitamin B3 vitamer (nicotinamide) and vitamin B6 vitamers (pyridoxial 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal hydrochloride (PL), pyridoxamine dihydrochloride (PM), pridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP), and pyridoxine hydrochloride (PN)) in human hair samples of the UAE population. Forty students' volunteers took part in the study and donated their hair samples. The analytes were extracted and then separated using a reversed-phase Poroshell EC-C18 column, eluted using two mobile phases, and quantified using LC/MS-MS system. The method was validated in human hair using parameters such as linearity, intra- and inter-day accuracy, and precision and recovery. The method was then used to detect vitamin B3 and B6 vitamers in the human hair samples. Of all the vitamin B3 and B6 vitamers tested, only nicotinamide was detected and quantified in human hair. Of the 40 samples analysed, 12 were in the range 100-200 pg/mg, 15 in the range 200-500 pg/mg, 9 in the range of 500-4000 pg/mg. The LC/MS-MS method is effective, sensitive, and robust for the detection of vitamin B3 and its vitamer nicotinamide in human hair samples. This developed hair test can be used in clinical examination to complement blood and urine tests for the long-term deficiency, detection, and quantification of nicotinamide."
