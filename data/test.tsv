"PMID 10368299: Several cholinesterase inhibitors are either being utilized for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease or are in advanced clinical trials. E2020, marketed as Aricept, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range. Our experimental structure of the E2020-TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the 'oxyanion hole', but only indirectly via solvent molecules. Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles."	0.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
"PMID 16275899: Like acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and is hence a viable therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by a cholinergic deficit. Potent, reversible, and brain-targeted BChE inhibitors (cymserine analogs) were developed based on binding domain structures to help elucidate the role of this enzyme in the central nervous system. In rats, cymserine analogs caused long-term inhibition of brain BChE and elevated extracellular ACh levels, without inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase. In rat brain slices, selective BChE inhibition augmented long-term potentiation. These compounds also improved the cognitive performance (maze navigation) of aged rats. In cultured human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid precursor protein, and secreted beta-amyloid peptide levels were reduced without affecting cell viability. Treatment of transgenic mice that overexpressed human mutant amyloid precursor protein also resulted in lower beta-amyloid peptide brain levels than controls. Selective, reversible inhibition of brain BChE may represent a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, improving cognition and modulating neuropathological markers of the disease."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
"PMID 37636505: In current research, two functional components, <i>i.e.</i>, hydrazone and bisphenol sulfide were combined to get useful supramolecules in medicinal chemistry. Herein 25 new 4,4'-thiodiphenol bis-acylhydrazones were synthesized in good to excellent yields. Initially ethyl-2-chloroacetate was reacted with 4,4'-thiodiphenol, which was further reacted with excess hydrazine hydrate to produce 2,2'-((thiobis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))di(acetohydrazide), which was then combined with various aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to get the desired products (hydrazones, 4a-4y). The synthesized supramolecules were characterized by contemporary spectroscopic techniques such as <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The synthetic compound's cholinesterase blocking activity was tested against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes where compounds 4n, and 4h showed excellent inhibitory potential for AChE, while 4b, and 4h, demonstrated most potent inhibition of BChE. The starting compound (SM3) and compounds 4h and SM3 depicted excellent dual inhibitory capabilities for both enzymes. The chemical basis of anticholinesterase activity was investigated using a structure-based molecular docking approach. The biological significance and the ease of synthesis of this class of compounds should be considered in therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease treatments."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
"PMID 34455970: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyloid models such as the 5XFAD mouse, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is associated with β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and has unique biochemical features which distinguish it from that found in neurons. It has been suggested that BChE associated with Aβ plaques may be involved in the maturation of this structure and thus disease progression. Currently, it is unknown whether BChE bound to Aβ plaques has altered biochemical properties due to a different primary structure or because of the association of this enzyme with Aβ plaques. Also, the source and binding mechanism of this BChE remains unknown. Brain tissue sections from the 5XFAD/BChE-KO mouse were incubated with exogenous sources of BChE and stained for this enzyme's activity. Efforts were made to determine what region of BChE or Aβ may be involved in this association. We found that incubation of 5XFAD/BChE-KO brain tissues with exogenous BChE led to this enzyme becoming associated with Aβ plaques and neurons. In contrast to neuronal BChE, the BChE bound to Aβ plaques had similar biochemical properties to those seen in AD. Mutations to BChE and efforts to block Aβ epitomes failed to prevent this association. The association of BChE with Aβ plaques, and the resultant biochemical changes, suggests that BChE may undergo a conformational change when bound to Aβ plaques but not neurons. The 5XFAD/BChE-KO model is ideally suited to explore the binding mechanism of BChE to Aβ plaques as well as the involvement of BChE in AD pathogenesis."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
"PMID 32250307: An epistatic interaction between the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOEɛ4) gene and the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) genes has been previously reported to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these observations were largely from case-control studies with small sample sizes. To examine the interaction between APOEɛ4 and BCHE-K on: 1) the risk of incident AD and 2) rates of change in brain volumes and cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD in a prospective cohort study. The study sample for survival analysis included 691 Caucasian participants (age at baseline, 58.4±9.9 years; follow-up time,16.9±9.7 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The neuroimaging sample included 302 participants with 1,388 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Cognitive performance was assessed in 703 participants over 4,908 visits. A total of 122 diagnoses (79 AD, 43 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) were identified. Participants with both APOEɛ4 and BCHE-K variants had a 3.7-fold greater risk of AD (Hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI=1.99-6.89, p < 0.001) compared to non-carriers of both genes (APOE ɛ4 x BCHE-K interaction p = 0.025). There was no APOE ɛ4-BCHE-K interaction effect on rate of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. The APOE and BCHE genes interact to influence risk of incident AD/MCI but not rates of brain atrophy and decline in cognitive performance before onset of cognitive impairment. This may suggest the epistatic interaction between APOE ɛ4 and BCHE-K on AD risk is disease stage-dependent."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
"PMID 9600986: Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
"PMID 20655099: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. It has emerged that Abeta toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Deltatau) and absence of tau in tau(-/-) mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Abeta toxicity. Deltatau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Abeta-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Abeta toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
"PMID 35820485: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatase and a key regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways. While PP2A dysfunction has been linked to human cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), PP2A regulation remains relatively poorly understood. It has been reported that the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) is inactivated by a single phosphorylation at the Tyr307 residue by tyrosine kinases such as v-Src. However, multiple mass spectrometry studies have revealed the existence of other putative PP2Ac phosphorylation sites in response to activation of Src and Fyn, two major Src family kinases (SFKs). Here, using PP2Ac phosphomutants and novel phosphosite-specific PP2Ac antibodies, we show that cellular pools of PP2Ac are instead phosphorylated on both Tyr127 and Tyr284 upon Src activation, and on Tyr284 following Fyn activation. We found these phosphorylation events enhanced the interaction of PP2Ac with SFKs. In addition, we reveal SFK-mediated phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Y284 promotes dissociation of the regulatory Bα subunit, altering PP2A substrate specificity; the phosphodeficient Y127/284F and Y284F PP2Ac mutants prevented SFK-mediated phosphorylation of Tau at the CP13 (pSer202) epitope, a pathological hallmark of AD, and SFK-dependent activation of ERK, a major growth regulatory kinase upregulated in many cancers. Our findings demonstrate a novel PP2A regulatory mechanism that challenges the existing dogma on the inhibition of PP2A catalytic activity by Tyr307 phosphorylation. We propose dysregulation of SFK signaling in cancer and AD can lead to alterations in PP2A phosphorylation and subsequent deregulation of key PP2A substrates, including ERK and Tau."	1.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
"PMID 36639708: Synaptic degeneration is a precursor of synaptic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology (FTD-tau), a group of primary tauopathies. A critical role in this degenerative process is assumed by enzymes such as the kinase Fyn and its counterpart, the phosphatase striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP<sub>61</sub>). Whereas the role of Fyn has been widely explored, less is known about STEP<sub>61</sub> that localises to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic neurons. In dementias, synaptic loss is associated with an increased burden of pathological aggregates. Tau pathology is a hallmark of both AD (together with amyloid-β deposition) and FTD-tau. Here, we examined STEP<sub>61</sub> and its activity in human and animal brain tissue and observed a correlation between STEP<sub>61</sub> and disease progression. In early-stage human AD, an initial increase in the level and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> was observed, which decreased with the loss of the synaptic marker PSD-95; in FTD-tau, there was a reduction in STEP<sub>61</sub> and PSD-95 which correlated with clinical diagnosis. In APP23 mice with an amyloid-β pathology, the level and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> were increased in the synaptic fraction compared to wild-type littermates. Similarly, in the K3 mouse model of FTD-tau, which we assessed at two ages compared to wild-type, expression and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> were increased with ageing. Together, these findings suggest that STEP contributes differently to the pathogenic process in AD and FTD-tau, and that its activation may be an early response to a degenerative process."	0.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
"PMID 35253743: Increasing evidence links impaired brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence prompted a search for molecular players common to AD and diabetes mellitus (DM). The work incorporated studies based on a primary care-based cohort (pcb-Cohort) and a bioinformatics analysis to identify central nodes, that are key players in AD and insulin signaling (IS) pathways. The interactome for each of these key proteins was retrieved and network maps were developed for AD and IS. Synaptic enrichment was performed to reveal synaptic common hubs. Cohort analysis showed that individuals with DM exhibited a correlation with poor performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test. Additionally, APOE ɛ2 allele carriers appear to potentially be relatively more protected against both DM and cognitive deficits. Ten clusters were identified in this network and 32 key synaptic proteins were common to AD and IS. Given the relevance of signaling pathways, another network was constructed focusing on protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and the top 6 kinase nodes (LRRK2, GSK3B, AKT1, EGFR, MAPK1, and FYN) were further analyzed. This allowed the elaboration of signaling cascades directly impacting AβPP and tau, whereby distinct signaling pathway play a major role and strengthen an AD-IS link at a molecular level."	0.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
"PMID 19251646: Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common single-gene cause of congenital heart disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder that also features proportionate short stature, facial abnormalities, and an increased risk of myeloproliferative disease. Germline-activating mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause about half of NS cases; other causative alleles include KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1 mutants. We showed previously that knock-in mice bearing the NS mutant Ptpn11(D61G) on a mixed 129S4/SvJae X C57BL6/J background exhibit all major NS features, including a variety of cardiac defects, with variable penetrance. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NS cardiac defects and whether genetic background and/or the specific NS mutation contribute to the NS phenotype remained unclear. Here, using an inducible knock-in approach, we show that all cardiac defects in NS result from mutant Shp2 expression in the endocardium, not in the myocardium or neural crest. Furthermore, the penetrance of NS defects is affected by genetic background and the specific Ptpn11 allele. Finally, ex vivo assays and pharmacological approaches show that NS mutants cause cardiac valve defects by increasing Erk MAPK activation, probably downstream of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases, extending the interval during which cardiac endocardial cells undergo endocardial-mesenchymal transformation. Our data provide a mechanistic underpinning for the cardiac defects in this disorder."	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
"PMID 24534818: Noonan syndrome (NS), a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 1000 to 2500 live births, is the most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease after Trisomy 21. To comprehensively define the spectrum of cardiac morphology and specific clinical course of a large cohort of NS patients. Retrospective, descriptive case series study. An international Harvard-based NS registry was combined with clinical data from NS patients followed at Boston Children's Hospital, Massachusetts, USA. We identified 293 patients with NS. Cardiovascular disease was seen in 81% (n=237) including pulmonary stenosis in 57%, secundum atrial septal defects in 32% and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 16%. A genetic mutation of the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway was identified in 62% (n=136). Genotype-phenotype associations were noted between PTPN11 mutations and atrial septal defects (p=0.001), and pulmonary stenosis (p<0.001). RAF1 mutations were associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p<0.001). Cardiovascular outcomes that differed specifically in a NS cohort included high re-intervention rates (65%) after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for valvar pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, in NS patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a clinically significant regression of hypertrophy (17%) was observed as was a markedly higher incidence of concomitant congenital heart defects (70%). Patients with NS have a distinct spectrum of cardiac phenotypes that may have a natural history and response to therapy atypical to that normally seen in non-syndromic heart disease. A diagnosis of NS in a patient with pulmonary stenosis or infant-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would facilitate condition-specific counselling on outcome and prognosis."	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
"PMID 30384889: Childhood cardiomyopathies are progressive and often lethal disorders, forming the most common cause of heart failure in children. Despite severe outcomes, their genetic background is still poorly characterized. The purpose of this study was to characterize the genetics of severe childhood cardiomyopathies in a countrywide cohort. The authors collected a countrywide cohort, KidCMP, of 66 severe childhood cardiomyopathies from the sole center in Finland performing cardiac transplantation. For genetic diagnosis, next-generation sequencing and subsequent validation using genetic, cell biology, and computational approaches were used. The KidCMP cohort presents remarkable early-onset and severe disorders: the median age of diagnosis was 0.33 years, and 17 patients underwent cardiac transplantation. The authors identified the pathogenic variants in 39% of patients: 46% de novo, 34% recessive, and 20% dominantly-inherited. The authors report NRAP underlying childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as novel phenotypes for known heart disease genes. Some genetic diagnoses have immediate implications for treatment: CALM1 with life-threatening arrhythmias, and TAZ with good cardiac prognosis. The disease genes converge on metabolic causes (PRKAG2, MRPL44, AARS2, HADHB, DNAJC19, PPA2, TAZ, BAG3), MAPK pathways (HRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, TAB2), development (NEK8 and TBX20), calcium signaling (JPH2, CALM1, CACNA1C), and the sarcomeric contraction cycle (TNNC1, TNNI3, ACTC1, MYH7, NRAP). Childhood cardiomyopathies are typically caused by rare, family-specific mutations, most commonly de novo, indicating that next-generation sequencing of trios is the approach of choice in their diagnosis. Genetic diagnoses may suggest intervention strategies and predict prognosis, offering valuable tools for prioritization of patients for transplantation versus conservative treatment."	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
"PMID 30805484: Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease and facial dysmorphia with an incidence of 1/1000 to 2500 live births. Up to now, several genes have been proven to be involved in the disturbance of the transduction signal through the RAS-MAP Kinase pathway and the manifestation of Noonan syndrome. The first gene described was <i>PTPN11</i>, followed by <i>SOS1</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and <i>RIT1</i>, and recently <i>SOS2</i>, <i>LZTR1</i>, and <i>A2ML1</i>, among others. Progressively, the physiopathology and molecular etiology of most signs of Noonan syndrome have been demonstrated, and inheritance patterns as well as genetic counseling have been established. In this review, we summarize the data concerning clinical features frequently observed in Noonan syndrome, and then, we describe the molecular etiology as well as the physiopathology of most Noonan syndrome-causing genes. In the second part of this review, we assess the mutational rate of Noonan syndrome-causing genes reported up to now in most screening studies. This review should give clinicians as well as geneticists a full view of the molecular aspects of Noonan syndrome and the authentic prevalence of the mutational events of its causing-genes. It will also facilitate laying the groundwork for future molecular diagnosis research, and the development of novel treatment strategies."	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
"PMID 31130285: Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by distinctive craniofacial appearance, short stature, and congenital heart disease. Approximately 80% of individuals with NS harbor mutations in genes whose products are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the underlying genetic causes in nearly 20% of individuals with NS phenotype remain unexplained. Here, we report four de novo RRAS2 variants in three individuals with NS. RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A>T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A>T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly. The same dose injection of mRNA encoding c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu) caused severe developmental impairments and low dose overexpression of this variant induced craniofacial defects. In contrast, the RRAS2 c.224T>G (p.Phe75Cys) change, located on the same allele with p.Gln72His in an individual with NS, resulted in no aberrant in vitro or in vivo phenotypes by itself. Together, our findings suggest that activating RRAS2 mutations can cause NS and expand the involvement of RRAS2 proto-oncogene to rare germline disorders."	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
"PMID 20538833: Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension, inflammation, renal disease progression, and cardiovascular disease. However, no data are available regarding the effect of allopurinol in patients with chronic kidney disease. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of 113 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) <60 ml/min. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with allopurinol 100 mg/d (n = 57) or to continue the usual therapy (n = 56). Clinical, biochemical, and inflammatory parameters were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment. The objectives of study were: (1) renal disease progression; (2) cardiovascular events; and (3) hospitalizations of any causes. Serum uric acid and C-reactive protein levels were significantly decreased in subjects treated with allopurinol. In the control group, eGFR decreased 3.3 +/- 1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and in the allopurinol group, eGFR increased 1.3 +/- 1.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) after 24 months. Allopurinol treatment slowed down renal disease progression independently of age, gender, diabetes, C-reactive protein, albuminuria, and renin-angiotensin system blockers use. After a mean follow-up time of 23.4 +/- 7.8 months, 22 patients suffered a cardiovascular event. Diabetes mellitus, previous coronary heart disease, and C-reactive protein levels increased cardiovascular risk. Allopurinol treatment reduces risk of cardiovascular events in 71% compared with standard therapy. Allopurinol decreases C-reactive protein and slows down the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, allopurinol reduces cardiovascular and hospitalization risk in these subjects."	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR	
"PMID 22717317: Diabetes is regarded as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent-ie, people with the disorder have a risk of coronary events similar to those with previous myocardial infarction. We assessed whether chronic kidney disease should be regarded as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. We studied a population-based cohort with measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria from Alberta, Canada. We used validated algorithms based on hospital admission and medical-claim data to classify participants with baseline history of myocardial infarction or diabetes and to ascertain which patients were admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction during follow-up (the primary outcome). For our primary analysis, we defined baseline chronic kidney disease as eGFR 15-59·9 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) (stage 3 or 4 disease). We used Poisson regression to calculate unadjusted rates and relative rates of myocardial infarction during follow-up for five risk groups: people with previous myocardial infarction (with or without diabetes or chronic kidney disease), and (of those without previous myocardial infarction), four mutually exclusive groups defined by the presence or absence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. During a median follow-up of 48 months (IQR 25-65), 11,340 of 1,268,029 participants (1%) were admitted to hospital with myocardial infarction. The unadjusted rate of myocardial infarction was highest in people with previous myocardial infarction (18·5 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 17·4-19·8). In people without previous myocardial infarction, the rate of myocardial infarction was lower in those with diabetes (without chronic kidney disease) than in those with chronic kidney disease (without diabetes; 5·4 per 1000 person-years, 5·2-5·7, vs 6·9 per 1000 person-years, 6·6-7·2; p<0·0001). The rate of incident myocardial infarction in people with diabetes was substantially lower than for those with chronic kidney disease when defined by eGFR of less than 45 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) and severely increased proteinuria (6·6 per 1000 person-years, 6·4-6·9 vs 12·4 per 1000 person-years, 9·7-15·9). Our findings suggest that chronic kidney disease could be added to the list of criteria defining people at highest risk of future coronary events.

"PMID 26028594: The usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria for prediction of cardiovascular outcomes is controversial. We aimed to assess the addition of creatinine-based eGFR and albuminuria to traditional risk factors for prediction of cardiovascular risk with a meta-analytic approach. We meta-analysed individual-level data for 637 315 individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease from 24 cohorts (median follow-up 4·2-19·0 years) included in the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium. We assessed C statistic difference and reclassification improvement for cardiovascular mortality and fatal and non-fatal cases of coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure in a 5 year timeframe, contrasting prediction models for traditional risk factors with and without creatinine-based eGFR, albuminuria (either albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] or semi-quantitative dipstick proteinuria), or both. The addition of eGFR and ACR significantly improved the discrimination of cardiovascular outcomes beyond traditional risk factors in general populations, but the improvement was greater with ACR than with eGFR, and more evident for cardiovascular mortality (C statistic difference 0·0139 [95% CI 0·0105-0·0174] for ACR and 0·0065 [0·0042-0·0088] for eGFR) and heart failure (0·0196 [0·0108-0·0284] and 0·0109 [0·0059-0·0159]) than for coronary disease (0·0048 [0·0029-0·0067] and 0·0036 [0·0019-0·0054]) and stroke (0·0105 [0·0058-0·0151] and 0·0036 [0·0004-0·0069]). Dipstick proteinuria showed smaller improvement than ACR. The discrimination improvement with eGFR or ACR was especially evident in individuals with diabetes or hypertension, but remained significant with ACR for cardiovascular mortality and heart failure in those without either of these disorders. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, the combination of eGFR and ACR for risk discrimination outperformed most single traditional predictors; the C statistic for cardiovascular mortality fell by 0·0227 (0·0158-0·0296) after omission of eGFR and ACR compared with less than 0·007 for any single modifiable traditional predictor. Creatinine-based eGFR and albuminuria should be taken into account for cardiovascular prediction, especially when these measures are already assessed for clinical purpose or if cardiovascular mortality and heart failure are outcomes of interest. ACR could have particularly broad implications for cardiovascular prediction. In populations with chronic kidney disease, the simultaneous assessment of eGFR and ACR could facilitate improved classification of cardiovascular risk, supporting current guidelines for chronic kidney disease. Our results lend some support to also incorporating eGFR and ACR into assessments of cardiovascular risk in the general population.

However, the effectiveness and mechanism of SXS have not been studied in detail yet. Current study aimed to identify the compounds in SXS, evaluate the formula efficacies using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and verify the pharmacological effects by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The compounds in SXS were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF-MS. Potential target genes for identified compounds were obtained from three databases. DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. PPI network was constructed to screen core targets. Molecular docking was used to examine interactions between active compounds and potential targets. The mechanism was also verified by model of acute blood stasis rats and human umbilical vein cells. In total, 45 compounds were identified from SXS. Among the detected phytochemicals, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, D-catechin, naringenin and amentoflavone were identified as the active constituents. SXS is primarily involved in the modulation of hypoxic state, vascular regulation, and inflammation response, according to GO and KGG pathway enrichment analysis. A network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was constructed and five core targets were identified as VEGFA, AKT1, EGFR, PTGS2, and MMP9. Molecular docking simulation revealed good binding affinity of the five putative targets with the corresponding compounds. SXS reduced HIF-1α and COX-2 levels and increased the eNOS expression levels in hypoxic HUVECs. SXS can reduce the whole blood viscosity in adrenaline induced acute blood stasis rats and relieve blood stasis. SXS removes blood stasis might through VEGFA/AKT/eNOS/COX-2 pathway and flavonoids are the main active components in the formula."	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR

Mean age was 53 (standard deviation 17) years and mean eGFR was 89 mL/min/1.73 m2, 15% had diabetes and 8.4% had urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) available (median 13 mg/g); 9.5% had prevalent CHD, 3.2% prior stroke, 3.3% HF, and 4.4% prior AF. During follow-up, there were 269 142 CHD, 311 021 stroke, 712 556 HF, and 605 596 AF incident events and 101 044 (0.4%) patients experienced KFRT. Both prevalent and incident CVD were associated with subsequent KFRT with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-3.3], 2.0 (1.9-2.1), 4.5 (4.2-4.9), 2.8 (2.7-3.1) after incident CHD, stroke, HF and AF, respectively. HRs were highest in first 3 months post-CVD incidence declining to baseline after 3 years. Incident HF hospitalizations showed the strongest association with KFRT [HR 46 (95% CI: 43-50) within 3 months] after adjustment for other CVD subtype incidence. Incident CVD events strongly and independently associate with future KFRT risk, most notably after HF, then CHD, stroke, and AF. Optimal strategies for addressing the dramatic risk of KFRT following CVD events are needed."	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR	
"PMID 23775317: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients are at increased risk for progression to cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to assess all-cause and liver-specific mortality in a cohort of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with and without NASH from two historic databases were included. Clinico-demographic information from the time of biopsy was available. Mortality data were obtained from National Death Index-Plus and used for estimating overall and cause-specific mortality. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare cohorts. Two hundred eighty-nine NAFLD patients were included (50.3 ± 14.5 years old, 39.4 % male, 78.6 % Caucasian, 46.0 % obese, 26.0 % diabetic, 5.9 % with family history of liver diseases). Of these, 59.2 % had NASH whereas 40.8 % had non-NASH NAFLD. NASH patients were predominantly female, had higher aspartate aminotranserase, alanine aminotransferase and fasting serum glucose. During follow-up (median 150 months, maximum 342 months), patients with NASH had higher probability of mortality from liver-related causes than non-NASH NAFLD patients (p value = 0.0026). In the entire NAFLD cohort, older age [aHR = 1.07 (95 % CI = 1.05-1.10)] and presence of type II diabetes [aHR = 2.09 (1.39-3.14)] were independent predictors of overall mortality. However, in addition to age [aHR = 1.06 (1.02-1.10)] having histologic NASH [aHR = 9.16 (2.10-9.88)] was found to be an independent predictor of liver-related mortality. Additionally, presence of type II diabetes was associated with liver-related mortality [aHR = 2.19 (1.00-4.81)]. This long-term follow-up of NAFLD patients confirms that NASH patients have higher risk of liver-related mortality than non-NASH. Additionally, patients with NAFLD and type II diabetes are at highest risk for overall and liver-related mortality."	0.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
"PMID 27166128: The protective effect of statins in cirrhosis and its decompensation in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients remains unknown. We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2009. A total of 298,761 CHB patients were identified. CHB patients using statins (n=6,543; defined as ≥28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD)) and a 1:1 ratio propensity score and inception point (the date of first use of statins)-matched non-statins (<28 cDDD) were followed up from the inception point until the development of cirrhosis or its decompensation or until withdrawal from insurance or December 2009. After adjustment for competing mortality, CHB patients using statins had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cirrhosis (relative risk)=0.433; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.344-0.515; modified log-rank test, P<0.001) and decompensated cirrhosis (relative risk=0.468; 95% CI=0.344-0.637; P<0.001) compared with patients not using statins. After adjustment for age, gender, comorbidity index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, aspirin use, diabetes medication, CHB treatment, non-statin lipid-lowering drugs, and triglyceride lipid-lowering drugs using the Cox proportional hazard model, statins were still an independent protector against cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=0.512; 95% CI=0.413-0.634; P<0.001) and its decompensation (AHR=0.534; 95% CI=0.433-0.659; P<0.001). The AHRs for cirrhosis were 0.467 and 0.200, and the AHRs for decompensated cirrhosis were 0.611 and 0.231 with 91-365 and >365 cDDD of statins, respectively. CHB patients who receive statin therapy have a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of cirrhosis and its decompensation."	0.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
"PMID 32087038: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to evaluate whether conventional histological grading of steatosis and accurate quantification of fat content in liver biopsies using stereological point counting (SPC) can predict mortality and future development of T2DM in NAFLD patients. 129 patients with biopsy proven NAFLD, enrolled between 1988 and 1992, were re-evaluated on two occasions, after 13.7 (±1.5) and 23.2 (±6.8) years. In patients accepting to undergo the procedure, repeat liver biopsies were performed on each follow-up and were evaluated with conventional histopathological methodology and SPC. Of the 106 patients without T2DM at baseline, 66 (62%) developed T2DM during a mean follow-up of 23.2 (± 6.8) years. Steatosis grade and liver fat measured with SPC independently (adjusted for age, BMI, fibrosis stage) predicted development of T2DM with an aHR of 1.60 per grade and 1.03 for each SPC percentage increase respectively. Overall mortality and development of T2DM was more common in patients with grade 3 steatosis compared to lower grades of steatosis. Liver fat measured with SPC was significant for overall mortality (aHR 1.04). In patients that underwent repeat biopsy, reduction in liver fat measured with SPC was associated with decreased risk of developing T2DM (aHR 0.91 for each SPC percentage decrease). Steatosis grade and liver fat measured with SPC predict mortality and the risk of developing T2DM in NAFLD. Reduction in liver fat decreases the risk of developing T2DM."	0.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
"PMID 31401392: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease. The literature suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and it can modulate the synthesis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Previous studies have shown that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme of oxidative stress, TNF-α is involved in the formation of insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress and insulin resistance are the key factors for the formation of NAFLD. Therefore, it can be said that AHR may participate in contributing to NAFLD by regulating CYP1A1 and TNF-α. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is an effective AHR inhibitor. The present study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of ANF in high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. Mice were fed HFD to induce NAFLD, HepG2 cells were exposed to OA to induce hepatocyte injury, and ANF significantly reduced mouse and cellular liver damage compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD and OA-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. ANF treatment reduces liver damage by reducing ROS and IR, the data show that ANF inhibits the expression of AHR, CYP1A1 and TNF-α in NAFLD. Taken together, these findings show that ANF alleviate NAFLD via regulation of AHR/CYP1A1 and AHR/TNF-α pathways, which may have potential for further development as novel therapeutic agents for NAFLD."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
"PMID 32941865: Inflammation, an old medical problem, is being recognized as an active, well orchestrated biological process. When dysregulated, chronic inflammation may ensue, leading to tissue-dependent diseases. Depending upon the ligand and cellular context, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may accelerate or attenuate inflammation and subsequent resolution. Three examples are discussed in which AHR modulates inflammation by a mixture of genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways: (i) AHR-agonistic bacterial virulence factors are leading to both microbial defense and resolution of inflammatory responses. (ii) TCDD-mediated persistent AHR activation initially leads to inflammation by non-genomic signaling, and may potentially lead to chronic inflammation. (iii) AHR may modulate anti-inflammatory actions in obesity-mediated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Hepatic lipotoxicity triggers generation of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that facilitate the development of hepatitis. AHR is mainly involved in the resolution phase by induction of lipoxin A4 and Il-22. Moderate AHR activation by phytochemicals and microbial AHR ligands may facilitate resolution. In control of inflammation, AHR appears to integrate environmental conditions with coordinated cellular functions."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
"PMID 23978414: In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and involved mechanisms of resveratrol on an established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) murine model. Wild-type and autophagic mediator ULK1 heterozygous knockout mice were induced to have NAFLD by high-fat diet for 8weeks. After that, resveratrol treatment was applied with the high-fat diet feeding for another 4weeks. Typical features of NAFLD, including histological changes, fibrosis, insulin resistance, oxidative status, and inflammation were characterized. After-treatment with resveratrol showed ameliorative effects on all measured features of NAFLD, from histology, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance to oxidative stress and inflammation. resveratrol treatment also reduced the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through the restoration of its inhibitor IκBα. Partial inhibition of ULK1 expression impaired the ameliorative effects of resveratrol on hepatic histology, fibrosis, oxidative status, inflammation, and NF-κB activity. In conclusion, resveratrol improved NAFLD-caused hepatic injury partially through regulating autophagic and IκBα-NF-κB pathways."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
"PMID 32042044: Autophagy is essential for cellular survival and energy homeostasis under nutrient deprivation. Despite the emerging importance of nuclear events in autophagy regulation, epigenetic control of autophagy gene transcription remains unclear. Here, we report fasting-induced Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21) signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via Jumonji-D3 (JMJD3/KDM6B) histone demethylase. Upon FGF21 signaling, JMJD3 epigenetically upregulates global autophagy-network genes, including Tfeb, Atg7, Atgl, and Fgf21, through demethylation of histone H3K27-me3, resulting in autophagy-mediated lipid degradation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of JMJD3 at Thr-1044 by FGF21 signal-activated PKA increases its nuclear localization and interaction with the nuclear receptor PPARα to transcriptionally activate autophagy. Administration of FGF21 in obese mice improves defective autophagy and hepatosteatosis in a JMJD3-dependent manner. Remarkably, in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, hepatic expression of JMJD3, ATG7, LC3, and ULK1 is substantially decreased. These findings demonstrate that FGF21-JMJD3 signaling epigenetically links nutrient deprivation with hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation in mammals."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
"PMID 31551937: Accumulating evidence suggests a role of bisphenol A (BPA) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of lipogenic genes, but the mechanism of BPA induced lipogenic gene expression remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 μg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For 5 weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in liver, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased liver lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in liver of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins were also significantly increased, and ERα protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB pathways."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
"PMID 31191364: Irbesartan has shown significant therapeutic effects in hypertensive patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To determine the underlying mechanisms of its action, we established an <i>in vitro</i> model of NAFLD by treating human and mouse hepatocytes with free fatty acids (FFAs) and angiotensin (Ang) II. Irbesartan significantly reversed AngII/FFA-induced lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers. In addition, irbesartan also increased the autophagy flux, in terms of increased numbers of autolysosomes and autophagosomes, and the upregulation and mitochondrial localization of the autophagic proteins Atg5 and LC3BII/I. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of the autophagic flux exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in the steatotic hepatocytes. Furthermore, AngII upregulated PKC which inhibited AMPK phosphorylation via direct interaction with the AngII receptor AT1-R. Irbesartan inhibited PKC and activated AMPK and its downstream effector ULK1, thereby inducing autophagy, decreasing lipid deposition, and restoring mitochondrial function. Taken together, irbesartan triggers autophagy via the PKC/AMPK/ULK1 axis to ameliorate the pathological changes in the steatotic hepatocytes."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
"PMID 32240652: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a devastating form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) has been recently introduced as anti-adipogenic compound. We aimed to investigate the effects of PP on high fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH in rats and examine the underlying mechanisms. NASH was induced by exposing rats to HFD for 16 weeks and a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) 35 mg/kg at the fifth week. At the tenth week, PP was given orally at a dose of 60 µg/kg, day after day for 6 weeks. HFD/STZ induced significant steatohepatitis and insulin resistance as was evident by the elevated transaminases activity, NAFLD activity score and HOMA-IR level. Also, HFD induced serum hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, HFD induced an imbalance in the oxidative status of the liver via upregulating lipid peroxides and mitochondrial oxidative stress markers (MnSOD, UCP-2), together with marked decrease in anti-oxidant glutathione level, glutathione peroxidase activity and expression of mitophagy related markers (PINK1, Parkin, ULK1) and increase in SQSTM1/p62 and LC3II/LC3I. Upregulation of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and apoptotic marker (caspase 3) were observed. Those events all together precipitated in initiation of liver fibrosis as confirmed by elevation of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and liver collagen content. Co-treatment with PP protected against HFD-induced NASH and liver fibrosis via downregulating the expression of key factors in Hedgehog and Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway. These findings imply that PP can attenuate the progression of NASH and its associated sequela of liver fibrosis."	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
"PMID 24025713: Here, we describe a novel interplay between NAD synthesis and degradation involved in pancreatic tumor growth. We used human pancreatic cancer cells, both in vitro (cell culture experiments) and in vivo (xenograft experiments), to demonstrate the role of NAD synthesis and degradation in tumor cell metabolism and growth. We demonstrated that pharmacologic and genetic targeting of Nampt, the key enzyme in the NAD salvage synthesis pathway, inhibits cell growth and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These changes were accompanied by a reduction of NAD levels, glycolytic flux, lactate production, mitochondrial function, and levels of ATP. The massive reduction in overall metabolic activity induced by Nampt inhibition was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in pancreatic tumor growth. The results of the mechanistic experiments showed that neither the NAD-dependent enzymes PARP-1 nor SIRT1 play a significant role on the effect of Nampt inhibition on pancreatic cancer cells. However, we identified a role for the NAD degradation pathway mediated by the NADase CD38 on the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. The responsiveness to Nampt inhibition is modulated by the expression of CD38; low levels of this enzyme decrease the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. In contrast, its overexpression decreased cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and further increased the sensitivity to Nampt inhibition. Our study demonstrates that NAD metabolism is essential for pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation and that targeting NAD synthesis via the Nampt pathway could lead to novel therapeutic treatments for pancreatic cancer."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT	
"PMID 28507103: In the last decade, substantial efforts have been made to identify NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis inhibitors, specifically against nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), as preclinical studies indicate their potential efficacy as cancer drugs. However, the clinical activity of NAMPT inhibitors has proven limited, suggesting that alternative NAD<sup>+</sup> production routes exploited by tumors confer resistance. Here, we show the gene encoding nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a second NAD<sup>+</sup>-producing enzyme, is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of common types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, where NAPRT expression correlates with a BRCAness gene expression signature. Both NAPRT and NAMPT increased intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. NAPRT silencing reduced energy status, protein synthesis, and cell size in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. NAPRT silencing sensitized cells to NAMPT inhibitors both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>; similar results were obtained with the NAPRT inhibitor 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. Reducing NAPRT levels in a BRCA2-deficient cancer cell line exacerbated DNA damage in response to chemotherapeutics. In conclusion, NAPRT-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis contributes to cell metabolism and to the DNA repair process in a subset of tumors. This knowledge could be used to increase the efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors and chemotherapy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3857-69. ©2017 AACR</i>."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT	
"PMID 36428689: Pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: PDAC) is one of the most aggressive neoplastic diseases. Metformin use has been associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence and better survival in diabetics. Metformin has been shown to inhibit PDAC cells growth and survival, both in vitro and in vivo. However, clinical trials using metformin have failed to reduce pancreatic cancer progression in patients, raising important questions about molecular mechanisms that protect tumor cells from the antineoplastic activities of metformin. We confirmed that metformin acts through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, decreasing the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, and that NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH homeostasis determines metformin sensitivity in several cancer cell lines. Metabolites that can restore the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio caused PDAC cells to be resistant to metformin. In addition, metformin treatment of PDAC cell lines induced a compensatory NAMPT expression, increasing the pool of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. The NAMPT inhibitor FK866 sensitized PDAC cells to the antiproliferative effects of metformin in vitro and decreased the cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pool. Intriguingly, FK866 combined with metformin increased survival in mice bearing KP4 cell line xenografts, but not in mice with PANC-1 cell line xenografts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the drug combination reactivated genes in the p53 pathway and oxidative stress, providing new insights about the mechanisms leading to cancer cell death."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT	
"PMID 35724566: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal diseases for which chemotherapy has not been very successful yet. FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) is a well-known NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) inhibitor with anti-cancer activities, but it failed in phase II clinical trials. We found that FK866 shows anti-proliferative activity in three PDAC cell lines, as well as in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells. More than 50 FK866 analogues were synthesized that introduce substituents on the phenyl ring of the piperidine benzamide group of FK866 and exchange its buta-1,4-diyl tether for 1-oxyprop-3-yl, (E)-but-2-en-1,4-diyl and 2- and 3-carbon tethers. The pyridin-3-yl moiety of FK866 was exchanged for chlorinated and fluorinated analogues and for pyrazin-2-yl and pyridazin-4-yl groups. Several compounds showed low nanomolar or sub-nanomolar cell growth inhibitory activity. Our best cell anti-proliferative compounds were the 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzamide analogue of FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-(2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoyl)piperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) (9), the 2,6-dimethoxybenzamide (8) and 2-methoxybenzamide (4), which exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.16 nM, 0.004 nM and 0.08 nM toward PDAC cells, respectively."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT

"PMID 25889214: The human genome encodes many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, their biological functions, molecular mechanisms, and the prognostic value associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a fundamental role for the lncRNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) in the progression and chemoresistance of PDAC. High-throughput microarrays were performed to detect the expression profiles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs in eight human PDAC tissues and four pancreatic tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the levels of HOTTIP and HOXA13 transcripts in PDAC cell lines and 90 PDAC samples from patients. HPDE6 cells (immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells) and corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were used as controls, respectively. The functions of HOTTIP and HOXA13 in cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were evaluated by targeted knockdown in vitro. CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, and xenografts in nude mice were used to investigate whether targeted silencing of HOTTIP could sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the relationship between HOXA13 expression and patient outcome. Microarray analyses revealed that HOTTIP was one of the most significantly upregulated lncRNAs in PDAC tissues compared with pancreatic tissues. Quantitative PCR further verified that HOTTIP levels were increased in PDAC cell lines and patient samples compared with controls. Functionally, HOTTIP silencing resulted in proliferation arrest by altering cell-cycle progression, and impaired cell invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, inhibition of HOTTIP potentiated the antitumor effects of gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of HOXA13 by RNA interference (siHOXA13) revealed that HOTTIP promoted PDAC cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance, at least partly through regulating HOXA13. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that higher HOXA13 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis, poor histological differentiation, and decreased overall survival in PDAC patients. As a crucial tumor promoter, HOTTIP promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance by modulating HOXA13. Therefore, the HOTTIP/HOXA13 axis is a potential therapeutic target and molecular biomarker for PDAC."	0.0	Pancreatic cancer	CCK	
"PMID 28697764: The function of a new long non-coding RNA linc00673 remains unclear. While identified as an oncogenic player in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), linc00673 was found to be anti-oncogenic in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However whether linc00673 regulated malignancy and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has not been characterized. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch assays and transwell invasion assays. Epithelial mesenchymal transition was examined using western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Interaction between miRNA and linc00673 was determined using luciferase reporter assays. In vivo experiments were performed to assess tumor formation. In addition, the expression data of NSCLC specimens of TCGA and patient survival data were utilized to explore the prognostic significance of linc00673. In the present study, we found high linc00673 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. In vitro experiments showed linc00673 knockdown reversed TGF-β induced EMT, and miR-150-5p was predicted to target linc00673 through bioinformatics tools. Overexpression of miR-150-5p suppressed lin00673's expression while inhibition of miR-150-5p led to significant upregulation of lin00673, suggesting that linc00673 could be negatively regulated by miR-150-5p, which was further confirmed by the inverse correlation between linc00673 and miR-150-5p in NSCLC patients' specimen. Furthermore, we proved that miR-150-5p could directly target linc00673 through luciferase assay, so linc00673 could sponge miR-150-5p and modulate the expression of a key EMT regulator ZEB1 indirectly. In addition, miR-150-5p inhibition abrogated linc00673 silence mediated proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT suppressing effect. Moreover, the inhibition of linc00673 significantly attenuated the tumorigenesis ability of A549 cells in vivo. We validated linc00673 as a novel oncogenic lncRNA and demonstrated the molecular mechanism by which it promotes NSCLC, which will advance our understanding of its clinical significance."	0.0	Pancreatic cancer	CCK	
"PMID 35408691: (1) Background: pancreatic cancer is one of the most serious cancers due to its rapid and inevitable fatality, which has been proved very difficult to treat, compared with many other common cancers. Thus, developing an effective therapeutic strategy, especially searching for potential drugs, is the focus of current research. The exact mechanism of rutin in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. (2) Method: three pancreatic cancer cell lines were used to study the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of rutin. The potent anti-proliferative, anti-migration and pro-apoptotic properties of rutin were uncovered by cell viability, a wound-healing migration assay, and a cell apoptosis assay. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to detect the change of miRNAs expression. Immunoblotting analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptotic proteins. (3) Results: CCK-8 and EDU assays revealed that rutin significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cells’ proliferation (p < 0.05). A wound-healing assay showed that rutin significantly suppressed pancreatic cancer cells’ migration (p < 0.05). A flow cytometric assay showed that rutin could promote pancreatic cancer cells’ apoptosis. Intriguingly, rutin significantly upregulated miR-877-3p expression to repress the transcription of Bcl-2 and to induce pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis. Accordingly, rutin and miR-877-3p mimics could promote apoptotic protein expression.

The invasion and migration of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group were decreased, while the invasion and migration of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group were increased. Western blotting showed that the expression of E‑cadherin, α‑E‑catenin, MMP‑3, MMP‑9, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was increased, while no significant difference was observed in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group. The results of immunohistochemistry were consistent with those of western blotting. KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group can inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group can significantly promote proliferation <i>in vivo</i>, but not significantly in vitro.

"PMID 38058810: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a notoriously aggressive malignancy with a survival rate of merely 9%. The prognosis in patients with PDAC is relatively poor, particularly in patients with advanced distant metastases. However, the mechanisms of PDAC progression remain elusive. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been implicated in the development of various malignancies, including PDAC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how a novel circRNA, <i>circATP13A1</i>, regulates PDAC progression. We used the GEO database to determine <i>circATP13A1</i> expression levels in cancer and adjacent cells and employed the limma package of R software to identify differentially expressed circRNAs. We detected the expression of <i>circATP13A1</i>, <i>miR-186</i>, and <i>miR-326</i> using qRT-PCR and investigated the effect of <i>circATP13A1</i> on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis <i>in vitro</i> using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), the transwell migration assay, and the flow cytometry assay. We then performed RNA pull-down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Western blot to verify the interaction between <i>circATP13A1</i>, <i>miR-186</i>, <i>miR-326</i>, and <i>HMGA2</i>. Moreover, we used a naked mice model to determine how <i>circATP13A1</i> affects tumor growth and progression <i>in vivo</i>. Loss and gain of function analyses revealed that <i>circATP13A1</i> upregulation promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, which results in PDAC progression and poor prognosis in patients. <i>CircATP13A1</i> knockdown significantly impaired cell proliferation and migration of PDAC cell lines. Additionally, <i>circATP13A1</i> knockdown significantly increased the expression of <i>miR-186</i> and <i>miR-326</i>, while reducing the expression of <i>HMGA2</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05), indicating that <i>miR-186</i> and <i>miR-326</i> are downstream targets of <i>circATP13A1</i>. Rescue experiments support the interactions between <i>circATP13A1</i>, <i>miR-186</i>, <i>miR-326</i>, and <i>HMGA2</i>. In conclusion, we demonstrated that <i>circATP13A1</i> sponges the <i>miR-186/miR-326/HMGA2</i>/axis, acting as an oncogene to promote PDAC development."	0.0	Pancreatic cancer	CCK	
"PMID 32442528: Over 40 000 patients with COVID-19 have been hospitalised in New York City (NY, USA) as of April 28, 2020. Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. This prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan. We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data. The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission. The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation. Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51-72), 171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%) patients had obesity. As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy. The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6). In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.

"PMID 19996060: Previous studies indicate that androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease among older men. We evaluated the relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men of all ages with prostate cancer. We conducted an observational study of 37,443 population-based men who were diagnosed with local or regional prostate cancer in the Veterans Healthcare Administration from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2004, with follow-up through December 31, 2005. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess whether androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, oral antiandrogens, the combination of the two (ie, combined androgen blockade), or orchiectomy was associated with diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or stroke, after adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. Overall, 14,597 (39%) of the 37,443 patients were treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Treatment with GnRH agonists was associated with statistically significantly increased risks of incident diabetes (for GnRH agonist therapy, 159.4 events per 1000 person-years vs 87.5 events for no androgen deprivation therapy, difference = 71.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 71.6 to 72.2; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.38), incident coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.28), myocardial infarction (12.8 events per 1000 person-years for GnRH agonist therapy vs 7.3 for no androgen deprivation therapy, difference = 5.5, 95% CI = 5.4 to 5.6; aHR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.52), sudden cardiac death (aHR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.54), and stroke (aHR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.36). Combined androgen blockade was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.53), and orchiectomy was associated with coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.87) and myocardial infarction (aHR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.27 to 3.50). Oral antiandrogen monotherapy was not associated with any outcome studied. Androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH agonists was associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease."	0.0	Diabetes	AHR	
"PMID 36817596: Subjects with diabetes are at higher risk of serious influenza-related complications. We aimed to investigate the yearly trend of influenza vaccination and factors associated with being unvaccinated for influenza in subjects with diabetes using a nationwide observational study performed within the recent decade. Among 105,732 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2019, 8,632 with diabetes were included. We investigated the yearly trend of influenza vaccination and factors associated with being unvaccinated for influenza. During the study period, the prevalence of influenza vaccination in subjects with diabetes showed a tendency to increase every year, reaching almost 60% in 2019, which was higher than the rate in subjects without diabetes. Younger age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95% CI] 11.29 [8.63-14.75] for < 50 years; 6.16 [5.21-7.29] for 50-65 years), male (aHR 1.67 [1.52-1.87]), current smoker (aHR 1.31 [1.00-1.72], lower-income status (aHR 1.46 [1.17, 1.84]), and high education level (aHR 1.30 [1.01-1.67]) were associated with being unvaccinated. Also, a poorer glycemic control with HbA1c ≥ 9% was found to be correlated with unvaccinated status (aHR 1.48 [1.15-1.90]). The influenza vaccination rate is still unsatisfactory in subjects with diabetes. Young age, males, low-income level, high education level, and poor glycemic control were associated with unvaccinated status. Considering the risk-benefits of influenza vaccination in patients with diabetes, physicians should make an effort to increase vaccination rates, especially in low vaccination rate groups."	0.0	Diabetes	AHR	
"PMID 36260549: Cancer is a major health problem in the U.S and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is known to increase the risk for the development of many cancers. Metformin, a first-line therapy for treating T2DM, is increasingly being used for its anticancer effects; however, the literature is limited on the effect of metformin dose on overall survival in patients with stage IV cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to the last known follow-up or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive on December 31, 2016 were censored. In this cohort study we examined the relationship between metformin dose and overall survival in persons with both T2DM and stage IV lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreas cancers. We used a retrospective study design with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 2007-2016 of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER) dataset. Of the 7,725 patients, 2,981(38.5%) had been prescribed metformin. Patients who used metformin had significantly better overall survival in both unadjusted (Unadjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76; p < 0.001) and adjusted models (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.81; p < 0.001). The overall survival between patients who took metformin with average daily dose ≥ 1000mg or < 1000mg were not statistically significant (aHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.08; p = 0.90).

"PMID 32541383: Optimal management of noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), is crucially important as people with HIV (PWH) live longer with antiretroviral therapy. Our objective was to assess patient-level and clinic-level factors associated with achieving hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤7.0% among PWH and DM. The DC Cohort, an observational clinical cohort of PWH, followed from 2011 to 2019 at 12 sites in Washington, DC. Among PWH with diagnosed DM and elevated HbA1c (>7.0%), we examined the association between achieving HbA1c ≤7.0% and demographic and clinical factors, including time-updated medication data, and clinic-level factors related to services and structure. A multilevel marginal extended Cox regression model was generated to identify factors associated with time to HbA1c ≤7.0%. Over half (52.3%) of 419 participants achieved HbA1c ≤7.0%. Individual-level factors associated with HbA1c ≤7.0% included a diagnosis of DM after enrollment and a longer time since HIV diagnosis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.65 and 1.13, P < 0.05 for both]. Attending a clinic with an endocrinologist was associated with the outcome [adjusted HR (aHR) = 1.41 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.01 to 1.97)]. In addition, comparing clinics that treat everyone, refer everyone or have a mix of treating and referring, showed an association between attending a clinic that treats everyone [aHR = 1.52 95% CI: (1.21 to 1.90)] or a clinic that refers everyone [aHR = 2.24 95% CI: (1.63 to 3.07)] compared with clinics with a mix in achieving glycemic control. Multiple factors are associated with achieving glycemic control in an urban cohort of PWH.

"PMID 16889756: Although inflammation has long been known as a localized protective reaction of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection, characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function, there has been a new realization about its role in a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. While acute inflammation is a part of the defense response, chronic inflammation can lead to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological diseases. Several pro-inflammatory gene products have been identified that mediate a critical role in suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Among these gene products are TNF and members of its superfamily, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, chemokines, MMP-9, VEGF, COX-2, and 5-LOX. The expression of all these genes are mainly regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is constitutively active in most tumors and is induced by carcinogens (such as cigarette smoke), tumor promoters, carcinogenic viral proteins (HIV-tat, HIV-nef, HIV-vpr, KHSV, EBV-LMP1, HTLV1-tax, HPV, HCV, and HBV), chemotherapeutic agents, and gamma-irradiation. These observations imply that anti-inflammatory agents that suppress NF-kappaB or NF-kappaB-regulated products should have a potential in both the prevention and treatment of cancer. The current review describes in detail the critical link between inflammation and cancer."	1.0	Diabetes	LOX	
"PMID 23143785: Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, β-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-κB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-β, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined.

"PMID 31687648: Diabetic bone disease is a complication of type I and type II diabetes, both of which are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. Increased hip and foot fracture rates do not correlate well with changes in bone mineral density (BMD), whereas studies support the importance of collagen structure to bone strength. Extracellular lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens resulting in aldehydes that subsequently form critically important biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. Although LOX-dependent biosynthetic crosslinks in bone collagen are deficient in diabetic bone, the expression and regulation of bone LOXs in diabetes have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. Moreover, we have identified a novel metabolic regulatory relationship that is dysregulated in diabetes using mouse models. Data indicate that the incretin (gastric hormone) known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that is anabolic to osteoblasts strongly upregulates LOX, and that this regulation is disrupted in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in mice. In vivo and in vitro studies support that diabetes results in elevated circulating peripheral dopamine, likely also derived from the gut, and is responsible for blocking GIP signaling and LOX levels in osteoblasts. Moreover, peripheral administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride to diabetic mice restored trabecular bone structure to near normal and partially reversed downregulation of LOX. Taken together our data identifies a novel metabolic relationship between the gut-derived hormone GIP and bone-derived LOX, and points to the importance of LOX dysregulation in the pathology of diabetic bone disease. © 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."	0.0	Diabetes	LOX	
"PMID 32182251: Traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes do not explain the increased CVD burden in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The oxidized-LDL receptor, LOX-1, is an inflammation-induced receptor implicated in atherosclerotic plaque formation in acute coronary syndrome, and here we evaluated its role in SLE-associated CVD. SLE patients have increased sLOX-1 levels which were associated with elevated proinflammatory HDL, oxLDL and hsCRP. Interestingly, increased sLOX-1 levels were associated with patients with early disease onset, low disease activity, increased IL-8, and normal complement and hematological measures. LOX-1 was increased on patient-derived monocytes and low-density granulocytes, and activation with oxLDL and immune-complexes increased membrane LOX-1, TACE activity, sLOX-1 release, proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes, and triggered the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps which can promote vascular injury. In conclusion, perturbations in the lipid content in SLE patients' blood activate LOX-1 and promote inflammatory responses. Increased sLOX-1 levels may be an indicator of high CVD risk, and blockade of LOX-1 may provide a therapeutic opportunity for ameliorating atherosclerosis in SLE patients."	0.0	Diabetes	LOX	
"PMID 33567774: Lipids are an essential constituent of the cell membrane of which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the most important component. Activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) induces the release of PUFAs from the cell membrane that form precursors to both pro- and ant-inflammatory bioactive lipids that participate in several cellular processes. PUFAs GLA (gamma-linolenic acid), DGLA (dihomo-GLA), AA (arachidonic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are derived from dietary linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) by the action of desaturases whose activity declines with age. Consequently, aged cells are deficient in GLA, DGLA, AA, AA, EPA and DHA and their metabolites. LA, ALA, AA, EPA and DHA can also be obtained direct from diet and their deficiency (fatty acids) may indicate malnutrition and deficiency of several minerals, trace elements and vitamins some of which are also much needed co-factors for the normal activity of desaturases. In many instances (patients) the plasma and tissue levels of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA are low (as seen in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus) but they do not have deficiency of other nutrients. Hence, it is reasonable to consider that the deficiency of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA noted in these conditions are due to the decreased activity of desaturases and elongases. PUFAs stimulate SIRT1 through protein kinase A-dependent activation of SIRT1-PGC1α complex and thus, increase rates of fatty acid oxidation and prevent lipid dysregulation associated with aging. SIRT1 activation prevents aging. Of all the SIRTs, SIRT6 is critical for intermediary metabolism and genomic stability. SIRT6-deficient mice show shortened lifespan, defects in DNA repair and have a high incidence of cancer due to oncogene activation. SIRT6 overexpression lowers LDL and triglyceride level, improves glucose tolerance, and increases lifespan of mice in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects at the transcriptional level. PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory metabolites influence the activity of SIRT6 and other SIRTs and thus, bring about their actions on metabolism, inflammation, and genome maintenance. GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (pro- and anti-inflammatory metabolites of AA respectively) activate/suppress various SIRTs (SIRt1 SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6), PPAR-γ, PARP, p53, SREBP1, intracellular cAMP content, PKA activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). This implies that changes in the metabolism of bioactive lipids as a result of altered activities of desaturases, COX-2 and 5-, 12-, 15-LOX (cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenases respectively) may have a critical role in determining cell age and development of several aging associated diseases and genomic stability and gene and oncogene activation. Thus, methods designed to maintain homeostasis of bioactive lipids (GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA, DHA, PGE2, LXA4) may arrest aging process and associated metabolic abnormalities."	0.0	Diabetes	LOX	
"PMID 38091482: The gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, is a target for the development of therapeutic agents to address type 2 diabetes and obesity. Signal transduction processes mediated by GPCR activation typically result in receptor phosphorylation, but very little is known about GIPR phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for detecting phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of proteins and for identifying modification sites. However, applying MS methods to GPCRs is challenging because the native expression levels are low and the hydrophobicity of these proteins complicates isolation and enrichment. Here we use a widely available technique, trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOF MS), to characterize the phosphorylation status of the GIPR. We identified eight serine residues that are phosphorylated, one in an intracellular loop and the remainder in the C-terminal domain. Stimulation with the native agonist GIP enhanced phosphorylation at four of these sites. For comparison, we evaluated tirzepatide (TZP), a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the GIPR that has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Stimulation with TZP enhanced phosphorylation at the same four sites that were enhanced with GIP; however, TZP also enhanced phosphorylation at a fifth site that is unique to this synthetic agonist. This work establishes an important and accessible tool for the characterization of signal transduction via the GIPR and reveals an unanticipated functional difference between GIP and TZP."	1.0	Diabetes	GIPR

"PMID 37946085: The development of single-molecule co-agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor (GIPR) is considered a breakthrough in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. But although GIPR-GLP-1R co-agonism decreases body weight with superior efficacy relative to GLP-1R agonism alone in preclinical<sup>1-3</sup> and clinical studies<sup>4,5</sup>, the role of GIP in regulating energy metabolism remains enigmatic. Increasing evidence suggests that long-acting GIPR agonists act in the brain to decrease body weight through the inhibition of food intake<sup>3,6-8</sup>; however, the mechanisms and neuronal populations through which GIP affects metabolism remain to be identified. Here, we report that long-acting GIPR agonists and GIPR-GLP-1R co-agonists decrease body weight and food intake via inhibitory GABAergic neurons. We show that acyl-GIP decreases body weight and food intake in male diet-induced obese wild-type mice, but not in mice with deletion of Gipr in Vgat(also known as Slc32a1)-expressing GABAergic neurons (Vgat-Gipr knockout). Whereas the GIPR-GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 leads, in male diet-induced obese wild-type mice, to greater weight loss and further inhibition of food intake relative to a pharmacokinetically matched acyl-GLP-1 control, this superiority over GLP-1 vanishes in Vgat-Gipr knockout mice. Our data demonstrate that long-acting GIPR agonists crucially depend on GIPR signaling in inhibitory GABAergic neurons to decrease body weight and food intake."	1.0	Diabetes	GIPR	
"PMID 37925022: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has a role in controlling postprandial metabolic tone. In humans, a GIP receptor (GIPR) variant (Q354, rs1800437) is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and increased risk for Type 2 Diabetes. To better understand the impacts of GIPR-Q354 on metabolism, it is necessary to study it in an isogeneic background to the predominant GIPR isoform, E354. To accomplish this objective, we used CRISPR-CAS9 editing to generate mouse models of GIPR-Q354 and GIPR-E354. Here we characterize the metabolic effects of GIPR-Q354 variant in a mouse model (GIPR-Q350). We generated the GIPR-Q350 mice for in vivo studies of metabolic impact of the variant. We isolated pancreatic islets from GIPR-Q350 mice to study insulin secretion ex vivo. We used a β-cell cell line to understand the impact of the GIPR-Q354 variant on the receptor traffic. We found that female GIPR-Q350 mice are leaner than littermate controls, and male GIPR-Q350 mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, in line with the association of the variant with reduced BMI in humans. GIPR-Q350 mice of both sexes are more glucose tolerant and exhibit an increased sensitivity to GIP. Postprandial GIP levels are reduced in GIPR-Q350 mice, revealing feedback regulation that balances the increased sensitivity of GIP target tissues to secretion of GIP from intestinal endocrine cells. The increased GIP sensitivity is recapitulated ex vivo during glucose stimulated insulin secretion assays in islets. Generation of cAMP in islets downstream of GIPR activation is not affected by the Q354 substitution. However, post-activation traffic of GIPR-Q354 variant in β-cells is altered, characterized by enhanced intracellular dwell time and increased localization to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN). Our data link altered intracellular traffic of the GIPR-Q354 variant with GIP control of metabolism. We propose that this change in spatiotemporal signaling underlies the physiologic effects of GIPR-Q350/4 and GIPR-E350/4 in mice and humans. These findings contribute to a more complete understanding of the impact of GIPR-Q354 variant on glucose homeostasis that could perhaps be leveraged to enhance pharmacologic targeting of GIPR for the treatment of metabolic disease."	1.0	Diabetes	GIPR

"PMID 16293236: Current antidotes for organophosphorus compounds (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with carbamates (pyridostigmine bromide), to protect acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from irreversible inhibition by OP compounds, and post-exposure therapy with anti-cholinergic drugs (atropine sulfate) to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and oximes (e.g., 2-PAM chloride) to reactivate OP-inhibited AChE. These antidotes are effective in preventing lethality from OP poisoning, but they do not prevent post-exposure incapacitation, convulsions, seizures, performance decrements, or in many cases permanent brain damage. These symptoms are commonly observed in experimental animals and are likely to occur in humans. The problems intrinsic to these antidotes stimulated attempts to develop a single protective drug, itself devoid of pharmacological effects, which would provide protection against the lethality of OP compounds and prevent post-exposure incapacitation. One approach is the use of enzymes such as cholinesterases (ChEs), beta-esterases in general, as single pretreatment drugs to sequester highly toxic OP anti-ChEs before they reach their physiological targets. This approach turns the irreversible nature of the OP: ChE interaction from disadvantage to an advantage; instead of focusing on OP as an anti-ChE, one can use ChE as an anti-OP. Using this approach, it was shown that administration of fetal bovine serum AChE (FBSAChE) or equine serum butyrylcholinesterase (EqBChE) or human serum BChE (HuBChE) protected the animals from multiple LD50s of a variety of highly toxic OPs without any toxic effects or performance decrements. The bioscavengers that have been explored to date for the detoxification of OPs fall into three categories: (A) those that can catalytically hydrolyze OPs and thus render them non-toxic, such as OP hydrolase and OP anhydrase; (B) those that stoichiometrically bind to OPs, that is, 1 mol of enzyme neutralizes one or 2 mol of OP inactivating both, such as ChEs and related enzymes; and (C) and those generally termed as ""pseudo catalytic"", e.g., a combination of ChE and an oxime pre-treatment such that the catalytic activity of OP-inhibited ChE can rapidly and continuously be restored in the presence of an oxime. Since the biochemical mechanism underlying prophylaxis by exogenous esterases such as ChEs is established and tested in several animal species, including non-human primates, this concept should allow a reliable extrapolation of results from animal experiments to human application. Having being extensively investigated by several groups, plasma derived HuBChE is judged to be the most suitable bioscavenger for its advancement for human use. The program is being developed at the present time for conducting a safety clinical trial in human volunteers. Several other candidate bioscavengers will follow; e.g., recombinant HuBChE expressed in the milk of transgenic goats, pseudo catalytic scavenger(s), e.g., a combination of ChE and oxime, and possibly PON 1 as a catalytic scavenger in the future."	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
"PMID 17192662: Current antidotal regimens for organophosphorus compound (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with a spontaneously reactivating AChE inhibitor such as pyridostigmine bromide, and postexposure therapy with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine sulfate and oximes such as 2-PAM chloride (Gray, 1984). Although these antidotal regimens are effective in preventing lethality of animals from OP poisoning, they do not prevent postexposure incapacitation, convulsions, performance deficits, or, in many cases, permanent brain damage (Dunn and Sidell, 1989). These problems stimulated the development of enzyme bioscavengers as a pretreatment to sequester highly toxic OPs before they reach their physiological targets. Several studies over the last two decades have demonstrated that exogenously administered human serum butyrylcholinesterase (Hu BChE) can be used successfully as a safe, efficacious, and single prophylactic treatment to counteract the toxicity of OPs. It also has potential use for first responders (civilians) reacting to terrorist nerve gas release, pesticide overexposure, or succinylcholine-induced apnea. A dose of 200 mg of Hu BChE in humans is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment that can protect from exposure of 2-5 x LD50 of nerve agents (Ashani, 2000)."	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
"PMID 31051153: Protective efficacy of N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) was assessed against sub-acute diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP) poisoning in mice. Mice were allocated into nine groups of six each: vehicle control; DFP (0.125 LD<sub>50</sub> ≈ 0.483 mg/kg bwt, s.c.); DFP + Atropine (ATR, 10 mg/kg bwt, i.p., 0 min); DFP + Pralidoxime (2-PAM, 30 mg/kg bwt, i.m., 0 min); DFP + NAC (150 mg/kg bwt, i.p., -60 min); DFP + ATR + NAC; DFP + 2-PAM + NAC; DFP + ATR + 2-PAM; and DFP + ATR + 2-PAM + NAC. Animals received various treatments for 21 d daily. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was measured after 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured (brain, liver and kidney) after 21 d of exposure. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and c-fos were also performed. DFP significantly reduced BChE and AChE levels. Diminished GSH, CAT, SOD (brain and liver), GPx, GR, and elevated MDA (Brain) levels were also observed. DFP caused notable histopathology (brain, liver and kidney) and over expression of iNOS, and c-fos proteins (brain). NAC enhanced the protective efficacy of ATR and 2-PAM in most parameters, without any appreciable protection in iNOS and c-fos expression. NAC as an adjunct with ATR and 2-PAM, exhibited marked beneficial effects against sub-acute DFP poisoning, indicating its possible implications in the management of OP poisoning."	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
"PMID 33592259: Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) include nerve agents and insecticides that potently inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an essential enzyme found throughout the nervous system. High exposure levels to OPs lead to seizures, cardiac arrest, and death if left untreated. Oximes are a critical piece to the therapeutic regimen which remove the OP from the inhibited AChE and restore normal cholinergic function. The current oximes 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and obidoxime (OBD) have two drawbacks: lack of broad spectrum protection against multiple OP structures and poor brain penetration to protect against OP central neurotoxicity. An alternative strategy to enhance therapy is reactivation of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). BChE is stoichiometrically inhibited by OPs with no apparent toxic result. Inhibition of BChE in the serum followed by reactivation could create a pseudo-catalytic scavenger allowing numerous regenerations of BChE to detoxify circulating OP molecules before they can reach target AChE. BChE in serum from rats, guinea pigs or humans was screened for the reactivation potential of our novel substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes, plus 2-PAM, MMB-4, TMB-4, HI-6, and OBD (100μM) in vitro after inhibition by highly relevant surrogates of sarin, VX, and cyclosarin, and also DFP, and the insecticidal active metabolites paraoxon, phorate-oxon, and phorate-oxon sulfoxide. Novel oxime 15 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited rat serum BChE while novel oxime 20 demonstrated significant broad spectrum reactivation of OP-inhibited human serum BChE. All tested oximes were poor reactivators of OP-inhibited guinea pig serum BChE. The bis-pyridinium oximes were poor BChE reactivators overall. BChE reactivation may be an additional mechanism to attenuate OP toxicity and contribute to therapeutic efficacy."	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
"PMID 32278739: Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is a stoichiometric bioscavenger that protects from the toxicity of nerve agents. Non-human primates are suitable models for toxicity studies that cannot be performed in humans. We evaluated the biochemical properties of native macaque (MaBChE) tetramers, compared to recombinant MaBChE monomers, PEGylated recombinant MaBChE tetramers and monomers, and native HuBChE tetramers. K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values for butyrylthiocholine were independent of subunit assembly status. The K<sub>m</sub> for all forms of MaBChE was about 70 μM, compared to 13 μM for HuBChE. The k<sub>cat</sub> was about 100,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for MaBChE and 30,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for HuBChE. The reversible inhibitor ethopropazine had similar K<sub>i</sub> values of 0.05 μM for all MaBChE forms and HuBChE. The bimolecular rate constant, ki, for inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog of sarin, was 2.2 to 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> for all MaBChE forms and for HuBChE. A major difference between MaBChE and HuBChE was the rate of reactivation by 2-PAM. The second order rate constant for reactivation of DFP-inhibited MaBChE by 2-PAM was 1.4 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, but was 380 fold faster for DFP-inhibited HuBChE (k<sub>r</sub> 531 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>). The acyl pocket of MaBChE has Leu285 in place of Pro285 in HuBChE. The reactivation rate of DFP-inhibited HuBChE mutant P285L by 2-PAM was reduced 5.8-fold (k<sub>r</sub> 92 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) indicating that P285 determines whether 2-PAM binds in an orientation that favors release of diisopropylphosphate. DFP-inhibited MaBChE treated with 0.2 M 2-PAM recovered 10% of its original activity, whereas DFP-inhibited HuBChE recovered 80% activity. It was concluded that the biochemical properties of MaBChE are similar to those of HuBChE except for the reactivation of DFP-inhibited BChE."	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
"PMID 11278378: Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD."	1.0		FYN	PP2
"PMID 11788577: The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system to inject the bacterial CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells. Within the host cell, CagA becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and initiates cytoskeletal rearrangements. We demonstrate here that Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases mediate CagA phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. First, the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 specifically blocks CagA phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangements thereby inhibiting the CagA-induced hummingbird phenotype of gastric epithelial cells. Second, CagA is in vivo phosphorylated by transiently expressed c-Src. Third, recombinant c-Src and lysates derived from c-Src-expressing fibroblasts but not lysates derived from Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells phosphorylated CagA in vitro. Fourth, a transfected CagA-GFP fusion protein is phosphorylated in vivo in Src-positive fibroblasts but not in Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells. Because a CagA-GFP fusion protein mutated in an EPIYA motif is not efficiently phosphorylated in any of these fibroblast cells, the CagA EPIYA motif appears to constitute the major c-Src phosphorylation site conserved among CagA-positive Helicobacter strains."	1.0		FYN	PP2
"PMID 36532777: Major surgery induces systemic inflammation leading to pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Endothelial inflammation is one of the drivers of postoperative organ damage, including acute kidney injury Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) is an important component of surgery-induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Kinases, the backbone of signalling cascades, can be targeted by pharmacological inhibition. This is a promising treatment option to interfere with excessive endothelial inflammation. In this study, we identified activated kinases as potential therapeutic targets. These targets were pharmacologically inhibited to reduce TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells. Kinome profiling using PamChip arrays identified 64 protein tyrosine kinases and 88 serine-threonine kinases, the activity of which was determined at various timepoints (5-240 min) following stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. The PTKs Axl and Fyn were selected based on high kinase activity profiles. Co-localisation experiments with the endothelial-specific protein CD31 showed Axl expression in endothelial cells of glomeruli and Fyn in arterioles and glomeruli of both control and TNF-α-exposed mice. Pharmacological inhibition with Axl inhibitor BMS-777607 and Fyn inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory activation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 at mRNA and VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 at protein level in HUVEC <i>in vitro</i>. Upon pharmacological inhibition with each inhibitor, leukocyte adhesion to HUVEC was also significantly reduced, however to a minor extent. In conclusion, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with kinase inhibitors BMS-777607 and PP2 reduces TNF-α-induced endothelial inflammation <i>in vitro</i>."	1.0		FYN	PP2

"PMID 35185557: Drug-associated context-induced relapse of cocaine-seeking behaviour requires the retrieval of drug-associated memory. Studies exploring the underlying neurobiological mechanism of drug memory formation will likely contribute to the development of treatments for drug addiction and the prevention of relapse. In our study, we applied a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and a self-administration paradigm (two drug-associated memory formation model) to confirm the hypothesis that the Src kinase Fyn critically regulates cocaine-associated memory formation in the hippocampus. For this experiment, we administered the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 into the bilateral hippocampus before cocaine-CPP and self-administration training, and the results showed that pharmacological manipulation of the Src kinase Fyn activity significantly attenuated the response to cocaine-paired cues in the cocaine-CPP and self-administration paradigms, indicating that hippocampal Fyn activity contributes to cocaine-associated memory formation. In addition, the regulation of cocaine-associated memory formation by Fyn depends on Tau expression, as restoring Tau to normal levels disrupted cocaine memory formation. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal Fyn activity plays a key role in the formation of cocaine-associated memory, which underlies cocaine-associated contextual stimulus-mediated regulation of cocaine-seeking behaviour, suggesting that Fyn represents a promising therapeutic target for weakening cocaine-related memory and treating cocaine addiction."	1.0		FYN	PP2
"PMID 22907845: Pancreatic cancer is a devastating malignancy, characterized by intrinsic or acquired resistance to conventional chemotherapies. Recent evidences suggest an involvement of tyrosine kinase pathway in the regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) protein gene expression. The aim of this study was to test whether gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor could regulate the MDR protein gene expression and sensitize the resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. The gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and PGP) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, and expression levels of various tyrosine kinases were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot in pancreatic cancer cell line. MTT assay was used for evaluating the effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutics induced drug resistance by regulating the gene expression of MDR proteins (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3), and increased the gene expression of RAF1/ERK and the phosphorylation of ERK in pancreatic cancer Bxpc-3 cells. Gefitinib caused an inhibition of p-ERK tyrosine kinase activation in a dose-dependent manner, and reversed gemcitabine-induced RAF1/ERK gene expression and p-ERK activation. In addition, a reversal of MDR proteins gene expression was achieved by gefitinib, which sensitized resistant cells to gemcitabine. This study demonstrated that MDR of Bxpc-3 cell is involved in the RAF1/ERK tyrosine kinase pathway. Gefitinib reverses the MDR protein gene expression and restores sensitivity of resistant cells to gemcitabine via RAF1/ERK signaling pathway. Combination of gefitinib with conventional chemotherapeutic agents may offer a new approach for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer."	1.0		RAF1	gefitinib

"PMID 25862004: Protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) is upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and expression levels correlate with the grade of malignancy in gliomas. A similar correlation was reported for its interacting partner 14-3-3β, which has been shown to facilitate the interaction of PTPIP51 with cRAF (Raf1). Since the interaction of these signalling partners stimulates growth factor signalling downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a major drug target in GBM, we here investigated the impact of EGFR inhibition by small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibody on PTPIP51. The effect of EGFR inhibition on PTPIP51 mRNA, protein expression and its interaction profile in GBM was analyzed using the U87 cell line as model system. The transferability of the results to in vivo conditions was evaluated in cultured tumour cells from GBM patients. Cells were treated either to the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR Gefitinib or the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab in a time and dose dependent manner. Gefitinib treatment decreased the proliferation rate and induced apoptosis in U87 and primary tumour cells. The PTPIP51 interaction profile changed in correlation to the applied Gefitinib. Despite unchanged mRNA levels PTPIP51 protein was reduced. In contrast, treatment with Cetuximab had no effects on PTPIP51 expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the impact of EGFR inhibition by Gefitinib on PTPIP51 protein expression, a downstream regulator of MAPK signalling. These data will serve as a basis to unravel the precise role of PTPIP51-mediated signalling in GBM and its potential implications for Gefitinib-mediated therapy in future studies."	1.0		RAF1	gefitinib
"PMID 37201366: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). However, suppression of EGFR did not improve the patient outcome, possibly due to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in PCa. Compounds able to suppress both PI3K/Akt and EGFR signaling may be effective for treating advanced PCa. We examined if caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) simultaneously suppresses the EGFR and Akt signaling, migration and tumor growth in PCa cells. Wound healing assay, transwell migration assay and xenograft mice model were used to determine the effects of CAPE on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to determine the effects of CAPE on EGFR and Akt signaling. CAPE treatment decreased the gene expression of HRAS, RAF1, AKT2, GSK3A, and EGF and the protein expression of phospho-EGFR (Y845, Y1069, Y1148, Y1173), phospho-FAK, Akt, and ERK1/2 in PCa cells. CAPE treatment inhibited the EGF-induced migration of PCa cells. Combined treatment of CAPE with EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed additive inhibition on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Injection of CAPE (15 mg/kg/3 days) for 14 days suppressed the tumor growth of prostate xenografts in nude mice as well as suppressed the levels of Ki67, phospho-EGFR Y845, MMP-9, phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Ras, and Raf-1 in prostate xenografts. Our study suggested that CAPE can simultaneously suppress the EGFR and Akt signaling in PCa cells and is a potential therapeutic agent for advanced PCa."	0.0		RAF1	gefitinib

This study explored the effects of SEC61G on MAPK signaling pathway and proliferation of cervical cancer (CC) cells. shRNA was used to inhibit the expression of SEC61G and EdU to observe its effect on the proliferation of CC cell SiHa. The effect of SEC61G on invasion was evaluated by Transwell assay. TCGA database was used to analyze the influence of high or low SEC61G expression level on the overall survival of CC patients. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of SEC61G, p-RAF1, Raf1, p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in cells. SiHa cells overexpressing SEC61G (SiHa-SEC61G) and control group (SiHa-mock) were subcutaneously implanted in nude mice. The tumor growth curve was measured at the specified time points between SiHa-SEC61G and SiHa-mock. The inhibitory effect of gefitinib on SEC61G was further evaluated. In patients with CC, high SEC61G expression predicted poor prognosis. Silencing SEC61G inhibited proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro. Overexpression of SEC61G can promote the proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of SEC61G promoted the proliferation of CC xenografts. Knocking down SEC61G can inhibit MAPK signaling pathway. Gefitinib can inhibit CC proliferation and tumor growth by SEC61G. SEC61G is highly expressed in CC and has poor prognosis. Inhibition of SEC61G expression can effectively inhibit the growth and proliferation of human CC cells. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway."	0.0		RAF1	gefitinib
"PMID 22285168: Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC. We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending ≥ 6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (≥ 1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225. Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·4-12·3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5·2 months (4·5-5·8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·25-0·54; p < 0·0001). Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22%]), anaemia (one [1%] vs three [4%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2%] vs 0). Five (6%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20%) on chemotherapy. One patient in the erlotinib group and two in the standard chemotherapy group died from treatment-related causes.

"PMID 17463250: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)-dependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well."	1.0		EGFR	erlotinib
"PMID 15329413: Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. In-frame deletions occur in exon 19, whereas point mutations occur frequently in codon 858 (exon 21). We found from sequencing the EGFR TK domain that 7 of 10 gefitinib-sensitive tumors had similar types of alterations; no mutations were found in eight gefitinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.004). Five of seven tumors sensitive to erlotinib (Tarceva), a related kinase inhibitor for which the clinically relevant target is undocumented, had analogous somatic mutations, as opposed to none of 10 erlotinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.003). Because most mutation-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas from patients who smoked <100 cigarettes in a lifetime (""never smokers""), we screened EGFR exons 2-28 in 15 adenocarcinomas resected from untreated never smokers. Seven tumors had TK domain mutations, in contrast to 4 of 81 non-small cell lung cancers resected from untreated former or current smokers (P = 0.0001). Immunoblotting of lysates from cells transiently transfected with various EGFR constructs demonstrated that, compared to wild-type protein, an exon 19 deletion mutant induced diminished levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine 1092 of an exon 21 point mutant was inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of drug. Collectively, these data show that adenocarcinomas from never smokers comprise a distinct subset of lung cancers, frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity."	1.0		EGFR	erlotinib
"PMID 31568888: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of cases. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are observed in approximately 40% and 20% of patients with NSCLC in Asian and non-Asian populations, respectively. First-generation (gefitinib, erlotinib) and second-generation (afatinib, dacomitinib) EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been standard-of-care (SoC) first-line treatment for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation positive advanced NSCLC following Phase III trials versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. However, most patients treated with first-line first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs develop resistance. Osimertinib, a third-generation, central nervous system active EGFR-TKI which potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI sensitizing (EGFRm) and the most common EGFR T790 M resistance mutations, has shown superior efficacy versus first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib / erlotinib). Osimertinib is now a treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFRm in the first-line setting, and treatment of choice for patients with T790 M positive NSCLC following disease progression on first-line EGFR-TKIs. The second-generation EGFR-TKI dacomitinib has also recently been approved for the first-line treatment of EGFRm positive metastatic NSCLC. There remains a need to determine appropriate sequencing of EGFR-TKIs in this setting, including EGFR-TKIs as monotherapy or in combination with other TKIs / signaling pathway inhibitors.

The development of T(reg) cells is reciprocally related to that of pro-inflammatory T cells producing interleukin-17 (T(H)17). Although T(reg) cell dysfunction and/or T(H)17 cell dysregulation are thought to contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders, little is known about the physiological pathways that control the generation of these cell lineages. Here we report the identification of the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a regulator of T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in mice. AHR activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induced functional T(reg) cells that suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, AHR activation by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole interfered with T(reg) cell development, boosted T(H)17 cell differentiation and increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Thus, AHR regulates both T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in a ligand-specific fashion, constituting a unique target for therapeutic immunomodulation."	1.0		AHR	"6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole"
"PMID 21600206: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is believed to involve an altered balance between effector and regulatory T cells. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the toxicity of dioxins, controls T-cell responses. We investigated the role of AhR in inflammation and pathogenesis of IBD in humans and mouse models. AhR expression was evaluated in intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBD and controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were activated in the presence or absence of the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (Ficz). Colitis was induced in mice using trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), or T-cell transfer. Mice were given injections of Ficz or the AhR antagonist 2-metyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid; some mice first received injections of a blocking antibody against interleukin (IL)-22. Cytokines were quantified by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Intestine tissue from patients with IBD expressed significantly less AhR than controls. In LPMCs from patients with IBD, incubation with Ficz reduced levels of interferon gamma (IFN)-γ and up-regulated IL-22. Mice injected with Ficz were protected against TNBS-, DSS-, and T-cell transfer-induced colitis; they had marked down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and induction of IL-22. Mice given AhR antagonist produced more inflammatory cytokines and less IL-22 and developed a severe colitis. Neutralization of endogenous IL-22 disrupted the protective effect of Ficz on TNBS-induced colitis. AhR is down-regulated in intestinal tissue of patients with IBD; AhR signaling, via IL-22, inhibits inflammation and colitis in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. AhR-related compounds might be developed to treat patients with IBDs."	1.0		AHR	"6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole"
"PMID 33790107: We had previously reported that treatment with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist β-naphthoflavone (βNF) suppressed mammosphere formation derived from cancer stem cells in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Cancer Lett., 317, 2012, Zhao et al.). Here, using several AHR agonists, we have investigated the association of this suppression with the classical ability to induce AHR-mediated gene transcription in the xenobiotic response element (XRE). The mammosphere formation assays were performed using wild-type and AHR-knockout MCF-7 cells in the presence of AHR agonists including 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), indirubin, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and kynurenine (KYN), followed by the XRE-reporter gene assays of the agonists. We showed that treatments with 3MC, BaP, and DMBA strongly suppressed mammosphere formation of the stem cells in an AHR-dependent manner, while other agonists showed weaker suppression. In reporter gene assays, the strength or duration of AHR/XRE-mediated gene transcription was found to be dependent on the agonist. Although strong transcriptional activation was observed with 3MC, FICZ, indirubin, I3C, IAA, or KYN after 6 h of treatment, only weak activation was seen with BaP or DMBA. While transcriptional activation was sustained or increased at 24 h with 3MC, BaP, or DMBA, appreciable reduction was observed with the other agonists. In conclusions, the results demonstrated that the suppressive effects of AHR agonists on mammosphere formation do not necessarily correlate with their abilities to induce AHR-mediated gene transcription. Hence, different AHR functions may be differentially induced in an agonist-dependent manner."	1.0		AHR	"6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole"
"PMID 31606975: microRNAs (miRNAs) play bifunctional roles in the initiation and progression of cancer, and recent evidence has confirmed that unusual expression of miRNAs is required for the progress of breast cancer. The regulatory role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its endogenous ligand, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) on the expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs, miR-22, miR-515-5p and miR-124-3p, as well as their association with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) were the aims of this study. In this experimental study, the expression levels of <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p, miR-124-3p</i> and <i>miR-382-5p</i> in MCF-7 cells were determined using the quantificational real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Our results revealed that <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p,</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i> expressions were significantly increased in cells transfected with ERα siRNA. Our data also showed that <i>miR-22, miR 515-5p,</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i> expression levels were significantly increased following FICZ treatment. Here, we found that AhR/ERα cross-talk plays a critical role in the expression of <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i> in MCF-7 cells. Overall, our data demonstrated that FICZ, as an AhR agonist could induce the expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs, <i>miR-22, miR-515-5p,</i> and <i>miR-124-3p</i>; thus, FICZ might be regarded as a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer treatment."	1.0		AHR	"6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole"
"PMID 33607406: Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent, debilitating skin disease of the hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep-seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillae, inguinal and anogenital regions. The pathophysiology of the disease remains elusive, with newer therapies targeting various aspects of the dysregulated immune system. This presents a useful opportunity to look at the cytokine profile in HS and other inflammatory conditions that share similar patterns with the aim of teasing out less considered explanations for HS pathogenesis. It has been observed that IL-17 appears to be the most common denominator linking HS with other immune mediated diseases like Crohn, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Given that IL-17 plays an important role in antifungal immunity, evidenced by the cytokine pattern in fungal disease and the bulk of data citing their potential involvement in Crohn, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis; it is fair to suggest the need to explore the role that fungi play in the setting of HS going forward. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) is a ubiquitous and largely conserved entity that is gaining interest in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. It is well known to modulate autoimmune states. Its activation by both exogenous and endogenous agents result in secretion of IL-17 by Th17 cells. One of such agents is the tryptophan metabolite 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ)-which can be produced by microorganisms such as fungi. It will be interesting to explore its usefulness in HS pathogenesis."	1.0		AHR	"6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole"
"PMID 30244168: B cell activating factor from the TNF family (BAFF) is implicated in not only the physiology of normal B cells, but also the pathophysiology of aggressive B cells related to malignant and autoimmune diseases. Autophagy plays a crucial role in balancing the beneficial and detrimental effects of immunity and inflammation. However, little is known about whether and how excessive BAFF mediates autophagy contributing to B-cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that excessive human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF) inhibited autophagy with a concomitant reduction of LC3-II in normal and B-lymphoid (Raji) cells. Knockdown of LC3 not only potentiated hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy, but also attenuated hsBAFF activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby diminishing hsBAFF-induced B-cell proliferation/viability. Further, we found that hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy was Akt/mTOR-dependent. This is supported by the findings that hsBAFF increased mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser757); Akt inhibitor X, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242, expression of dominant negative Akt, or knockdown of mTOR attenuated hsBAFF-induced phosphorylation of ULK1, decrease of LC3-II level, and increase of cell proliferation/viability. Chelating intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) with BAPTA/AM or preventing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation using EGTA or 2-APB profoundly blocked hsBAFF-induced activation of Akt/mTOR, phosphorylation of ULK1 and decrease of LC3-II, as well as increase of cell proliferation/viability. Similar effects were observed in the cells where CaMKII was inhibited by KN93 or knocked down by CaMKII shRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that hsBAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival through activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level or CaMKII, Akt, or mTOR activity to promote autophagy may be exploited for prevention of excessive BAFF-induced aggressive B lymphocyte disorders and autoimmune diseases."	0.0		ULK1	pp242
"PMID 26636543: mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 target--ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin, pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, short-term pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria, which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles (mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death. Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell--survival or cell death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy."	1.0		ULK1	pp242
"PMID 29154199: Autophagy is a self-digestive pathway that helps to maintain cellular homeostasis, and many autophagy-related gene (ATG)s involved the regulation of the autophagy process. Ultraviolet light is a common stressor of skin, but it is unclear how autophagy is regulated after ultraviolet exposure in epidermal keratinocytes. Here, we found that the mRNAs of some key ATG genes such as ULK1, ATG5 and ATG7 exhibited significantly lower levels in the skin tissues of the face and chest with solar ultraviolet exposure, compared with perineal skin. Interestingly, UVB radiation down-regulated the expression of ULK1, ATG3 and ATG7, and it inhibited the autophagy flux via a mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR)-independent pathway in human keratinocytes. The inhibition of autophagy in UVB-treated keratinocytes cannot be restored by treatment with the MTOR-dependent autophagy inducer rapamycin. Importantly, UVB treatment perturbs the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II and LC3-II turnover in response to treatment with MTOR inhibitors (Torin 1 and pp242), as well as endoplasmic reticular stress (A23187 and tunicamycin), inositol pathway (L690,330) and autophagy inducers (resveratrol and STF62247). Our study demonstrates that UVB radiation down-regulates several key autophagy-related proteins and impairs the autophagy response in keratinocytes.

"PMID 37886951: Metabolic stress in skeletal muscle cells causes sustained metabolic changes, but the mechanisms of the prolonged effects are not fully known. In this study, we tested C2C12 cells with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulator AICAR and measured the changes in the metabolic pathways and signaling kinases. AICAR caused an acute increase in the phosphorylation of the AMPK target ULK1, the mTORC1 substrate S6K, and the mTORC2 target Akt. Intriguingly, prior exposure to AICAR only decreased glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity when it underwent three-hour recovery after exposure to AICAR in a bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (KHB) instead of Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM). The phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target S6K was increased after recovery in DMEM but not KHB, although this appeared to be specific to S6K, as the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target site on ULK1 was not altered when the cells recovered in DMEM. The phosphorylation of mTORC2 target sites was also heterogenous under these conditions, with Akt increasing at serine 473 while other targets (SGK1 and PKCα) were unaffected. The exposure of cells to rapamycin (an mTORC1 inhibitor) and PP242 (an inhibitor of both mTOR complexes) revealed the differential phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates. Taken together, the data suggest that prior exposure to AICAR causes the selective phosphorylation of mTOR substrates, even after prolonged recovery in a nutrient-replete medium."	0.0		ULK1	pp242
"PMID 35818423: Obesity is a primary factor provoking various chronic disorders, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and causes the death of 2.8 million individuals each year. Diet, physical activity, medications, and surgery are the main therapies for overweightness and obesity. During weight loss therapy, a decrease in energy stores activates appetite signaling pathways under the regulation of neuropeptides, including anorexigenic [corticotropin-releasing hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cholecystokinin (CCK), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript] and orexigenic [agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and melanin-concentrating hormone] neuropeptides, which increase food intake and lead to failure in attaining weight loss goals. Ginseng and ginsenosides reverse these signaling pathways by suppressing orexigenic neuropeptides (NPY and AgRP) and provoking anorexigenic neuropeptides (CCK and POMC), which prevent the increase in food intake. Moreover, the results of network pharmacology analysis have revealed that constituents of ginseng radix, including campesterol, beta-elemene, ginsenoside Rb1, biotin, and pantothenic acid, are highly correlated with neuropeptide genes that regulate energy balance and food intake, including <i>ADIPOQ</i>, <i>NAMPT</i>, <i>UBL5</i>, <i>NUCB2</i>, <i>LEP</i>, <i>CCK</i>, <i>GAST</i>, <i>IGF1</i>, <i>RLN1</i>, <i>PENK</i>, <i>PDYN</i>, and <i>POMC</i>.

"PMID 38003249: The aim of this study was to investigate NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox regulation in astrocytes by Ginsenoside Rb1 subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and to reveal the neuroprotective mechanism of ginseng. Neonatal mouse brain was used to culture primary astrocytes. The third generation of the primary astrocytes was used for the experiments. OGD/R was introduced by culturing the cells in a glucose-free media under nitrogen for 6 h followed by a regular culture for 24 h. Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury in a dose-dependent manner. It improved the mitochondrial function of OGD/R astrocytes indicated by improving mitochondrial distribution, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhancing mitochondrial DNA copies and ATP production. Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly lifted intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH, NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>, and GSH/GSSG in OGD/R astrocytes. It inhibited the protein expression of both PARP1 and CD38, while attenuating the SIRT1 drop in OGD/R cells. In line with its effects on PARP1, Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced the expression of poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) proteins in OGD/R cells. Ginsenoside Rb1 also significantly increased the expression of NAMPT and NMNAT2, both of which are key players in NAD/NADH synthesis.

"PMID 27601167: The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway plays the important role in medulloblastoma (MB). Altered GLI expression plays a key role in these processes, and the inhibition of GLI may be a good cancer-targeted therapy. This study aimed to investigate whether GANT61, a GLI inhibitor, may inhibit the SHH signalling pathway promoting cell mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and enhance cisplatin apoptosis antineoplastic therapy. In our study, we determined the effect of GANT61-mediated inhibition of GLI in Daoy MB cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations of GANT61 alone or in combination with cisplatin. Cell proliferation was assessed with CCK-8 assays, and cell invasion and migration were performed using 8-µm transwell inserts. Cell apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometric analysis and rhodamine 123. qPCR was used to complete RNA experiments. Protein expression was assessed with Western blotting. The GANT61 significantly inhibited cell proliferation. GANT61 decreased the cell migration and invasion, impairing these crucial steps in tumour progression. Cell apoptosis was significantly increased in Daoy cells. Rhodamine 123 assay showed that GANT61 could decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential promoting cell mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. GANT61 inhibited the expression of GLI and Bcl-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels and might affect the expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 to promote cell intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, GANT61 could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis to decrease the IC50 value of cisplatin. Finally, data suggest that GANT61 could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis through promoting the expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 protein levels.

"PMID 30268354: Studies have identified that the fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) exhibited tumor-like characteristics and was the key factor in the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). GANT61, an antagonist of the sonic hedgehog pathway, has been verified with inhibitory effect on many cancers. Here we investigated the effect of GANT61 on FLS and the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 40 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal, CIA, CIA+10 mg/kg GANT61 and CIA+20 mg/kg GANT61. CIA was induced in rat with collagen injecting. The GANT61 was administered by intraperitoneal injection every 2 days for 3 weeks. The CIA model was identified with the paw swelling, arthritis score and the pathologic changes in joint. The FLS of different group were primary cultured. The proliferative capacity of FLS was detecteded via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method, and the apoptosis was detecteded by flow cytometry. The Bcl-2, Bax, Caspases3 and cleaved Caspases3 in synovium and FLS were detecteded by Western Blot. The 20 mg/kg GANT61 treatment reduced the incidence of CIA and relieved the arthritis symptoms in CIA rats. The Bcl-2 was upregulated and the Bax was downregulated in the CIA rats synovium. The 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg GANT61 diminished the Bcl-2 expression, 20 mg/kg GANT61 increased the Bax and activated the Caspases3 in the CIA synovium. The proliferation of CIA-FLS was significantly higher and the apoptosis of the CIA-FLS was lower than that of the control group. The 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg GANT61 treatment can reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by diminishing Bcl-2 and increasing the Bax in CIA-FLS.

"PMID 35933378: Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases, and seriously reduces the quality of life of patients. However, the pathogenesis of this disease is unclear. Therefore, more studies are needed to elucidate its pathogenesis. Our previous publication found that the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway was activated in endometriosis. This study tested whether SHH signaling in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) was critical for the pathogenesis of endometriosis. To examine the effect of inhibiting the SHH signaling pathway on endometriosis, we first isolated ESCs from eutopic endometrial tissues of patients with or without endometriosis and identified the extracted cells by morphological observation and immunofluorescence. Then, we treated ESCs with the GLI inhibitor GANT61 and used CCK-8, wound healing and invasion assays to detect cell activities, such as proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we detected the expression of key proteins and proliferation markers of the SHH signaling pathway in the lesions of nude mice using immunochemistry. We demonstrated that higher concentrations of GANT61 decreased the proliferation rate and migration distance of ESCs. We observed that GANT61 inhibited the invasion of ESCs. In addition, blockage of the SHH signaling pathway significantly reduced cell proliferation in vitro. Our study suggested that inhibition of the SHH pathway is involved in cell proliferation and invasive growth in the pathogenesis of endometriosis."	0.0		CCK	gant61

Prospective study of 1046 patients at 47 French clinical sites. Potential determinants of diabetes occurrence, defined by confirmed increased glycemia and/or initiation of antidiabetic treatment, were assessed by a proportional hazards model, including time-updated metabolic parameters and ART exposure. Among the cohort, representing 7846 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 54% received indinavir, 75% stavudine and 52% didanosine. Overall, 111 patients developed diabetes, with an incidence of 14.1/1000 PYFU (14.6 in men, 12.6 in women). Incidence peaked in 1999-2000 (23.2/1000 PYFU) and decreased thereafter. The incidence of diabetes was associated [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), all P<0.02] with older age (hazard ratio = 2.13 when 40-49 years, hazard ratio = 3.63 when ≥50 years), overweight (hazard ratio = 1.91 for a BMI 25-29 kg/m(2), hazard ratio = 2.85 >30 kg/m(2)), waist-to-hip ratio (hazard ratio = 3.87 for ≥0.97 male/0.92 female), time-updated lipoatrophy (hazard ratio = 2.14) and short-term exposure to indinavir (0-1 year: hazard ratio = 2.53), stavudine (0-1 year: hazard ratio = 2.56, 1-2 years: hazard ratio = 2.65) or didanosine (2-3 years: hazard ratio = 3.16).

"PMID 21483703: In Mozambique during 2004-2007 numbers of adult patients (≥15 years old) enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) increased about 16-fold, from <5,000 to 79,500. All ART patients were eligible for co-trimoxazole. ART program outcomes, and determinants of outcomes, have not yet been reported. In a retrospective cohort study, we investigated rates of mortality, attrition (death, loss to follow-up, or treatment cessation), immunologic treatment failure, and regimen-switch, as well as determinants of selected outcomes, among a nationally representative sample of 2,596 adults initiating ART during 2004-2007. At ART initiation, median age of patients was 34 and 62% were female. Malnutrition and advanced disease were common; 18% of patients weighed <45 kilograms, and 15% were WHO stage IV. Median baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was 153/µL and was lower for males than females (139/µL vs. 159/µL, p<0.01). Stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine or efavirenz were prescribed to 88% of patients; only 31% were prescribed co-trimoxazole. Mortality and attrition rates were 3.4 deaths and 19.8 attritions per 100 patient-years overall, and 12.9 deaths and 57.2 attritions per 100 patient-years in the first 90 days. Predictors of attrition included male sex [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-1.8], weight <45 kg (AHR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9, reference group >60 kg), WHO stage IV (AHR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4, reference group WHO stage I/II), lack of co-trimoxazole prescription (AHR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), and later calendar year of ART initiation (AHR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8). Rates of immunologic treatment failure and regimen-switch were 14.0 and 0.6 events per 100-patient years, respectively. ART initiation at earlier disease stages and scale-up of co-trimoxazole among ART patients could improve outcomes. Research to determine reasons for low regimen-switch rates and increasing rates of attrition during program expansion is needed."	0.0		AHR	stavudine
"PMID 30700732: HIV with HBV co-infection can result in greater HIV-related immunosuppression, morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are few studies to evaluate direct treatment effects on mortality and attrition rates between first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) based-on tenofovir (TDF) and/or lamivudine (3TC) in a real-world setting. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate direct treatment effects of the first-line ART containing stavudine (d4T), azidothymidine (AZT) and TDF on death and attrition among HIV patients with HBV coinfection. A total of 3912 patients met study eligibility criteria. The overall mortality rate and attrition rate was 2.85 (95% CI: 2.55-3.16) and 8.87 (95% CI: 8.32-9.41) per 100 person-years, respectively. The ART containing TDF had a significantly lower risk of death [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.77] when compared to the ART containing d4T, but the risk of death was not significantly different when compared to the ART containing AZT (AHR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.69-1.20). Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection receiving the ART containing TDF had significantly lower risk rates of attrition compared to those receiving the ART containing d4T (AHR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86) or AZT (AHR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58-0.77). Compared with the ART containing d4T, the ART containing AZT was significant and not significant associated with a lower risk of death and attrition, respectively.

In two teaching hospital in Ethiopia: Debremarkose 23% and Yirgalem 73.2% of study participants reported at least one ADR. Since there was limited information about ADR in the study area; we aimed to determine its incidence-rate and predictors. we conducted retrospective cohort study using medical records of HIV-infected patients enrolled on ART between 2006 and 2017 in government hospitals of Ethiopia.

This study evaluates the prevalence of lipodystrophy, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and analyses risk factors in HIV-infected Ethiopians taking cART. A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted at tertiary-level hospitals. Eligible participants attending the HIV clinics were enrolled. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical, HIV treatment variables, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose level, risk factors and components of MetS, also lipodystrophy, were studied. Data were analysed by SPSS statistical package V.25 with descriptive and analytical statistics. For multivariable analysis of risk factors, a logistic regression model was used. Results were presented in frequency and percentages, mean±SD, or median+IQR. Statistical significance was taken as p<0.05.

"PMID 21307302: Lipid signaling is dysregulated in many diseases with vascular pathology, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-α. To better understand the protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. ω-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary ω-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the ω-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that ω-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of ω-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation. It also suggests that cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen (but not lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton) might be used without losing the beneficial effect of dietary ω-3 PUFA."	1.0		LOX	zileuton
"PMID 18281656: Increased expression of eicosanoids in cancer has been associated with adverse prognosis. We performed a randomized phase II trial to test the hypothesis that inhibitors of two eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], celecoxib and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX], zileuton) added to chemotherapy would improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC, a performance status of 0 to 2, and no prior therapy were eligible. All patients received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 mg/mL x min day 1 + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) days 1 and 8. Patients were randomly assigned to: (a) zileuton 600 mg PO qid, (b) celecoxib 400 mg PO bid, or (c) celecoxib and zileuton at the same doses. Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and 5-LOX was performed without knowledge of outcomes. One hundred forty patients were entered and 134 were eligible and treated. There was no survival difference between the arms. COX-2 expression was a negative prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.51, P = .019 for index >or= 4; HR = 4.16, P = .005 for index = 9) for patients not receiving celecoxib. Patients with increased COX-2 expression (index >or= 4), receiving celecoxib had better survival than did COX-2-expressing patients not receiving drug (HR = .342, P = .005 for OS; HR = .294, P = .002 for failure-free survival). Multivariate analysis confirmed the interaction of COX-2 and celecoxib on survival. 5-LOX expression was neither prognostic nor predictive. This study failed to demonstrate the value of dual eicosanoid inhibition or benefit from either agent alone in addition to chemotherapy. However, a prospectively defined subset analysis suggests an advantage for celecoxib and chemotherapy for patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression."	1.0		LOX	zileuton

The current investigation evaluates the 5-LOX inhibitory potential of these alkaloids. Molecular docking results indicated that these alkaloids have similar binding energy as that of Zileuton, a commercial drug. Analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations, the binding free energy derived from MM-PBSA and interaction entropy indicated that vasicinone (-8.33 kcal/mol) exhibited a binding free energy comparable to that of Zileuton (-8.52 kcal/mol). The in-vitro results indicate the potential of vasicinone as a competitive inhibitor, while the in-silico results highlighted the potential of vasicine and deoxyvasicine as allosteric inhibitors. A possible mechanism behind the activity exhibited by the plant was also determined, which emphasized the potential of these alkaloids as leads for the design of novel 5-LOX inhibitors."	1.0		LOX	zileuton
"PMID 32031284: New pyrazolone derivatives structurally related to celecoxib and FPL 62064 were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenases (COXs) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and their selectivity indices were calculated. The results showed that compounds 3f, 3h, 3l, and 3p have an excellent COX-2 selectivity index. Moreover, they showed potent 5-LOX inhibitory activity relative to celecoxib and zileuton, as positive controls. These promising candidates were further investigated for anti-inflammatory activity using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema method and ulcerogenic liability. The results showed no ulceration, which implies their gastric safety profile. Moreover, these compounds were evaluated for prostaglandin (PGE2) production in rat serum. Molecular docking in the COX-2 and 5-LOX active sites was performed to rationalize their anti-inflammatory activities. Strong binding interactions and effective docking scores were identified. The results indicated that these derivatives are good leads for dual-acting COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors to be used as potent and safe anti-inflammatory agents."	1.0		LOX	zileuton
"PMID 31796842: Regeneration is the unmatched liver ability for recovering its functional mass after tissue lost. Leukotrienes (LT) are a family of eicosanoids with the capacity of signaling to promote proliferation. We analyzed the impact of blocking LT synthesis during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Male Wistar rats were subjected to two-third PH and treated with zileuton, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Our first find was a significant increment of intrahepatic LTB4 during the first hour after PH together with an increase in 5-LOX expression. Zileuton reduced hepatic LTB4 levels at the moment of hepatectomy and also inhibited the increase in hepatic LTB4. This inhibition produced a delay in liver proliferation as seen by decreased PCNA and cyclin D1 nuclear expression 24 h post-PH. Results also showed that hepatic LTB4 diminution by zileuton was associated with a decrease in NF-ĸB activity. Additionally, decreased hepatic LTB4 levels by zileuton affected the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) from zileuton-treated PH-rats displayed higher apoptosis than NPCs from PH control rats. In conclusion, the present work provides evidences that 5-LOX activation and its product LTB4 are involved in the initial signaling events for liver regeneration after PH and the pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme can delay the initial time course of the phenomenon."	1.0		LOX	zileuton
"PMID 38091482: The gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, is a target for the development of therapeutic agents to address type 2 diabetes and obesity. Signal transduction processes mediated by GPCR activation typically result in receptor phosphorylation, but very little is known about GIPR phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for detecting phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of proteins and for identifying modification sites. However, applying MS methods to GPCRs is challenging because the native expression levels are low and the hydrophobicity of these proteins complicates isolation and enrichment. Here we use a widely available technique, trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOF MS), to characterize the phosphorylation status of the GIPR. We identified eight serine residues that are phosphorylated, one in an intracellular loop and the remainder in the C-terminal domain. Stimulation with the native agonist GIP enhanced phosphorylation at four of these sites. For comparison, we evaluated tirzepatide (TZP), a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the GIPR that has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Stimulation with TZP enhanced phosphorylation at the same four sites that were enhanced with GIP; however, TZP also enhanced phosphorylation at a fifth site that is unique to this synthetic agonist. This work establishes an important and accessible tool for the characterization of signal transduction via the GIPR and reveals an unanticipated functional difference between GIP and TZP."	1.0		GIPR	tirzepatide

"PMID 37897727: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIPR) receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in glucose homeostasis. Diabetogenic conditions decrease β-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) levels in human islets. In mouse β cells, ARRB2 dampens insulin secretion by partially uncoupling cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling at physiological doses of GLP-1, whereas at pharmacological doses, the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) requires ARRB2. In contrast, GIP-potentiated insulin secretion needs ARRB2 in mouse and human islets. The GIPR-ARRB2 axis is not involved in cAMP/PKA or ERK signaling but does mediate GIP-induced F-actin depolymerization. Finally, the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide does not require ARRB2 for the potentiation of insulin secretion. Thus, ARRB2 plays distinct roles in regulating GLP-1R and GIPR signaling, and we highlight (1) its role in the physiological context and the possible functional consequences of its decreased expression in pathological situations such as diabetes and (2) the importance of assessing the signaling pathways engaged by the agonists (biased/dual) for therapeutic purposes."	1.0		GIPR	tirzepatide
"PMID 37591245: The incretin system is an essential metabolic axis that regulates postprandial metabolism.

These experiments were done in order to determine whether indoxylacetate could be an adequate chromogenic reactant for AChE assay evaluation. Moreover, the results were compared to the standard Ellman's method. We calculated Michaelis constant Km (2.06 × 10(-4) mol/L for acetylthiocholine and 3.21 × 10(-3) mol/L for indoxylacetate) maximum reaction velocity V(max) (4.97 × 10(-7) kat for acetylcholine and 7.71 × 10(-8) kat for indoxylacetate) for electric eel AChE. In a second part, inhibition values were plotted for paraoxon, and reactivation efficacy was measured for some standard oxime reactivators: obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM) and HI-6. Though indoxylacetate is split with lower turnover rate, this compound appears as a very attractive reactant since it does not show any chemical reactivity with oxime antidots and thiol used for the Ellman's method. Thus it can be advantageously used for accurate measurement of AChE activity. Suitability of assay for butyrylcholinesterase activity assessment is also discussed."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam
"PMID 1494302: Heptylphysostigmine (HPTL), a derivative of the AChE inhibitor physostigmine (PHY), is under investigation as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease. HPTL is active against human RBC AChE both in vitro and in vivo. Activity of HPTL against human brain has not been documented. We have developed an in vitro assay system using particulate membrane fractions which permits comparison of inhibition and recovery kinetics of human RBC (primarily globular dimer) and brain (primarily globular tetramer) membrane-bound forms. Under these conditions the HPTLIC50 is similar for the two forms. RBC AChE inhibition spontaneously reverses in 24 h, as occurs in vivo. In striking contrast, activity of inhibited brain enzyme does not recover on overnight incubation. DDVP-induced inhibition, but not HPTL inhibition, can be reversed by the oxime 2-PAM. Some recovery of HPTL inhibition, but not to the level seen with RBC AChE, occurs on addition of heat-stable fractions from serum or CSF. Brain enzyme recovers rapidly from PHY in this system. Responses of brain and RBC AChE to HPTL indicate that these forms are functionally as well as structurally distinct. Since brain inhibition apparently does not spontaneously reverse like RBC inhibition, peripheral measurements of patient responses should be assessed with caution during treatment with HPTL."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam

A common absorbance-based AChE activity assay that uses 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) can have limited sensitivity and be prone to interference. Therefore, an alternative assay was developed, in which AChE activity was determined by measuring fluorescence of resorufin produced from coupled enzyme reactions involving acetylcholine and Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine). The Amplex Red assay was used for two separate applications. First, AChE activity was measured in rat whole blood, which is a biomarker for exposure to AChE inhibitor pesticides. Activity was quantified from a 10(5)-fold dilution of whole blood, and there was a linear correlation between Amplex Red and DTNB assays. For the second application, Amplex Red assay was used to measure AChE inhibition potency in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), which is important for assessing pharmacological and toxicological potential of AChE inhibitors including drugs, phytochemicals, and pesticides. Five known reversible inhibitors were evaluated (IC50, 7-225 nM), along with irreversible inhibitors chlorpyrifos-oxon (ki=1.01 nM(-1)h(-1)) and paraoxon (ki=0.16 nM(-1)h(-1)). Lastly, in addition to inhibition, AChE reactivation was measured in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM).

"PMID 23916150: Neurotoxic organophosphorus compounds (OPs), which are used as pesticides and chemical warfare agents lead to more than 700,000 intoxications worldwide every year. The main target of OPs is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme necessary for the control of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The control of ACh function is performed by its hydrolysis with AChE, a process that can be completely interrupted by inhibition of the enzyme by phosphylation with OPs. Compounds used for reactivation of the phosphylated AChE are cationic oximes, which usually possess low membrane and hematoencephalic barrier permeation. Neutral oximes possess a better capacity for hematoencephalic barrier permeation. NMR spectroscopy is a very confident method for monitoring the inhibition and reactivation of enzymes, different from the Ellman test, which is the common method for evaluation of inhibition and reactivation of AChE. In this work (1)H NMR was used to test the effect of neutral oximes on inhibition of AChE and reactivation of AChE inhibited with ethyl-paraoxon. The results confirmed that NMR is a very efficient method for monitoring the action of AChE, showing that neutral oximes, which display a significant AChE inhibition activity, are potential drugs for Alzheimer disease. The NMR method showed that a neutral oxime, previously indicated by the Ellman test as better in vitro reactivator of AChE inhibited with paraoxon than pralidoxime (2-PAM), was much less efficient than 2-PAM, confirming that NMR is a better method than the Ellman test."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam
"PMID 11278378: Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect.

"PMID 11756483: The increased production of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease is acknowledged to be a key pathogenic event. In this study, we examined the response of primary human and rat brain cortical cultures to Abeta administration and found a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation content of numerous neuronal proteins, including tau and putative microtubule-associated protein 2c (MAP2c). We also found that paired helical filaments of aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau are tyrosine phosphorylated, indicating that changes in the phosphotyrosine content of cytoplasmic proteins in response to Abeta are potentially an important process. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and other neuronal proteins was specific to fibrillar Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(1-42). The tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by addition of the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7(t-butyl)pyrazol(3,4-d)pyramide (PP2) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Tyrosine phosphorylation of tau and MAP2c was concomitant with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent putative activation of the non-receptor kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Immunoprecipitation of Fyn, a member of the Src family, from Abeta(25-35)-treated neurons showed an increased association of Fyn with FAK. Abeta treatment of cells also stimulated the sustained activation of extracellular regulated kinase-2, which was blocked by addition of PP2 and LY 294002, suggesting that FAK/Fyn/PI3-kinase association is upstream of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in Abeta-treated neurons. This cascade of signaling events contains the earliest biochemical changes in neurons to be described in response to Abeta exposure and may be critical for subsequent neurodegenerative changes."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2

In the present article, Panaxadiol could significantly improve the ability of learning and memory of mice and reduce its synaptic dysfunction. Panaxadiol could down-regulate GluN2B's phosphorylation level by inhibition Fyn kinase activity, Subsequently, decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated synaptic damage, reducing LDH leakage, inhibiting apoptosis in AD, resulting in facilitating the cells survival. For the underlying molecular mechanism, we used PP2 to block the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKIIα signaling pathway. The results from WB showed that the expression of related proteins in the Fyn signaling pathway decreased with PP2 treated. Our results indicate that Panaxadiol could decrease synaptic damage, which will cause AD via inhibition of the Fyn/GluN2B/CaMKIIα signaling pathway. Thus, the Panaxadiol is a best promising candidate to test as a potential therapy for AD."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
"PMID 33536910: The activity of Ras, a small GTPase protein, is increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> on the activation of Ras, and the involvement of the Ras hyperactivity in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced deficits in spatial cognition and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in mice (Aβ-mice) enhanced hippocampal Ras activation and expression, while 60 min incubation of hippocampal slices in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ-slices) only elevated Ras activity. Aβ-mice showed deficits in spatial cognition and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, but basal synaptic transmission was enhanced. The above effects of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> were corrected by the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS). ERK2 phosphorylation increased, and Src phosphorylation decreased in Aβ-mice and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices. Both were corrected by FTS. In CA1 pyramidal cells of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, the response of AMPA receptor and phosphorylation of GluR1 were enhanced with dependence on Ras activation rather than ERK signaling. In contrast, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function and GluN2A/2B phosphorylation were downregulated in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, which was recovered by application of FTS or the Src activator ouabain, and mimicked in control slices treated with the Src inhibitor PP2. The administration of PP2 impaired the spatial cognition and LTP induction in control mice and FTS-treated Aβ-mice. The treatment of Aβ-mice with ouabain rescued Aβ-impaired spatial cognition and LTP. Overall, the results indicate that the oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> hyperactivates Ras and thereby causes the downregulation of Src which impedes NMDAR-dependent LTP induction resulting in cognitive deficits."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
"PMID 34818135: Although amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the mechanisms of Aβ neurotoxicity remain to be clarified. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Aβ on postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) tyrosine phosphorylation. Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying it may be a promising therapy in AD. Aβ25-35 oligomers (20 μg/rat) were administered intracerebroventricularly in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot was applied for measuring the protein levels of PSD-95 and β-actin. Following 3, 7, 14, 21 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 increased significantly, and peaked at 3 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment in hippocampal CA1 subfield. Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SrcPTKs) specific inhibitor PP2 attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 induced by Aβ25-35. Amantadine [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor noncompetitive antagonist], NVP-AAM077 (GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) and Ro25-6981 (GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) also suppressed the Aβ25-35-induced PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that Aβ oligomers induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs, which is mediated by the activation of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors."	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
"PMID 36756695: Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease of glucose metabolism. Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to reveal the expression of BASP1 and its biological roles in endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes complicated by cardiovascular disease. By analyzing the databases related to diabetes complicated with coronary heart disease, BASP1 was screened out as an upregulated gene. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary mouse aortic endothelial cells were treated with high glucose to establish cell models of diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction, and the expression changes of BASP1 were verified by RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. BASP1 was silenced or overexpressed by siRNA or overexpression plasmid, and its effects on cell migration, apoptosis, tube formation, inflammatory response, and ROS were detected. The possible signaling pathway of BASP1 was found and the mechanism of BASP1 on promoting the progression of endothelial dysfunction was explored using the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the expression of BASP1 in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant coronary heart disease was increased. High glucose induced the upregulation of BASP1 expression in endothelial cells, and showed a time-dependent relationship. Silencing of BASP1 alleviated the damage of high glucose to endothelial cells. BASP1 regulated EGFR positively. The promoting effect of BASP1 on endothelial cell apoptosis may be achieved by regulating the EGFR pathway. BASP1 promotes endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose in patients with diabetes, which may be activated by activating the EGFR pathway."	0.0	Heart Disease		gefitinib
"PMID 26039117: The aim of this study is to determine whether renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASBs), which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-2 receptor 1 blockers (ARBs), improve the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The medical charts of 117 patients with metastatic NSCLC were retrospectively assessed. Thirty-seven patients (RASB group) using RASBs during systemic treatment were compared with 80 controls (control group) who did not use RASBs following the diagnosis of NSCLC. The histological tumor subtype, performance status, age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, other medications, chemotherapeutics (CT), and erlotinib that were received in any line of treatment were recorded. We compared the OS of the patients in the RASB and control groups.The median (±SD) age of the patients was 61 (±1) years and all patients were administered systemic treatment (CT or erlotinib). The patients in RASB group were more likely to be smokers, have hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and use erlotinib, thiazides, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers (P < 0.05 for all) compared with the control group. The median follow-up time was 18.9 months (range 1-102 months) for the entire group. The median follow-up period was longer for RASB group than control group (17 vs 11 months, P = 0.033). The most commonly prescribed RASB agent was valsartan (n = 12/37). At the time of the analysis, 98 (83.7%) of all patients had died. In the univariate analysis, the median OS was longer in the RASB group compared with the control group (17 [±4.1] vs 12 [±1.4] months, P = 0.016). Interestingly, further analyses revealed that RASBs significantly improved OS only if used with erlotinib concurrently (34 [±13.8] vs 25 [±5] months, P = 0.002) and the OS benefit was more attributable to ARBs because only 4 patients received ACEI and erlotinib concurrently. However, the benefit of ARBs on OS disappeared in the multivariate analysis.The use of ARBs during erlotinib treatment may prolong OS of patients with metastatic NSCLC."	0.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
"PMID 23660125: Cardiac toxicity, manifested as diminished contractility, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure is a major issue in drug safety. Concerns revolve around targeted drugs (TKIs) where contractility effects were not anticipated. The ability to predict cardiac toxicity early would help to de-risk drugs in development and prepare physicians to manage risk in the clinic. Issues with current preclinical studies include insufficient testing with informative, translatable models, and predictive biomarkers. The isolated heart model is amenable to multiple assessments which can be combined with current technologies to assess toxicity on a multi-scale level. Rat isolated heart model was used to assess changes in left ventricular (LV) contractility and protein biomarkers BNP, IL6, TNFα, and cardiac troponins T (TnT) and I (TnI). Responses were assessed during perfusion with modified Henseleit Krebs (MHK), and 20 min concentration escalations of verapamil, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), isoproterenol, or 20 min escalations bracketing clinical blood concentrations of sunitinib, sorafenib, and erlotinib. LV parameters and effluent for biomarkers were collected before and during escalating drug concentrations. Verapamil reduced inotropy with no change in biomarkers, FCCP and isoproterenol reduced and increased heart function respectively and increased TnT and TNFα. Erlotinib had no significant effects on function or biomarkers. Sunitinib diminished function, increased TNFα at 0.1 μM, and increased TnT at higher concentrations. Sorafenib dose dependently increased TNFα beginning at 0.1 μM, reducing contractility and flow rate at 0.6 μM. The ex-vivo assay is a sensitive and predictive model for assessing changes in heart function and biomarkers of toxicity and injury. This assay demonstrates the potential for sunitinib and sorafenib to cause cardiac toxicity in humans. Also, TNFα appears to be a biomarker in the heart prior to injury. Due to its versatility, the isolated heart assay has potential to fill gaps in cardiac safety testing early in drug development."	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
"PMID 26886479: Erlotinib maintenance treatment improves progression-free survival compared with observation after first-line chemotherapy in unselected advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Very few cardiac adverse effects have been observed in phase III studies on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). We report the case of a 71-year-old woman with metastatic NSCLC treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed and then erlotinib maintenance therapy. After 26 months of TKI therapy, she developed dilated cardiomyopathy. Despite symptomatic treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased to 25%. Ischemic heart disease was excluded by coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and no other cause was found. Erlotinib was stopped, and cardiac resynchronization therapy by pacemaker was initiated. This case report highlights the possible cardiotoxic effects of long-term erlotinib and suggests the need for close clinical and echocardiographic follow-up of patients receiving long-term TKI therapy."	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
"PMID 34919300: Long eyelashes have been popularized and many commercially available products exist to achieve eyelash growth as a desired cosmetic effect. Eyelash trichomegaly may be induced by medications, procedures, or be related to medical conditions; however, the exact mechanisms that govern eyelash growth are not well elucidated. This study aims to identify and summarize aetiologies associated with eyelash trichomegaly. We report a systematic review of 148 clinical trials, prospective and retrospective studies, and case reports describing all evidence-based potential aetiologies of eyelash trichomegaly obtained from the Medline/PubMed and Cochrane Library through January 2021. Inclusion criteria were defined as (i) human studies involving congenital and acquired diseases in which eyelash trichomegaly is a characteristic or (ii) assessment of trichomegaly as an adverse or desired effect of a medication or procedure. Exclusion criteria included: animal studies, articles not available in English, outcomes unrelated to eyelash trichomegaly, and secondary review articles. Pharmacologic agents associated with eyelash trichomegaly included prostaglandin analogues (15-keto fluprostenol isopropyl ester, bimatoprost, latanoprost, and travoprost), epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib, and panitumumab), interferon-alpha, and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine). Surgical procedures of the eyelid, as well as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, HIV, ichthyosis vulgaris (IV), uveitis, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis were also associated with increased eyelash growth. Congenital disorders associated with lengthened eyelashes included Cantú syndrome, CHOPS syndrome, Coffin-Siris syndrome, congenital heart disease, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Costello syndrome, familial trichomegaly, Floating Harbor syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Kabuki-Makeup syndrome, KBG syndrome, Oliver-McFarlane syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. While the most common cause of eyelash trichomegaly is topical bimatoprost use, better understanding of pathways implicated in eyelash trichomegaly may lead to the discovery of additional medications to stimulate eyelash growth and create avenues for future therapeutic interventions."	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
"PMID 36795511: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a familial heart disease partly caused by impaired desmosome turnover. Thus, stabilization of desmosome integrity may provide new treatment options. Desmosomes, apart from cellular cohesion, provide the structural framework of a signaling hub. Here, we investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cardiomyocyte cohesion. We inhibited EGFR under physiological and pathophysiological conditions using the murine plakoglobin-KO AC model, in which EGFR was upregulated. EGFR inhibition enhanced cardiomyocyte cohesion. Immunoprecipitation showed an interaction of EGFR and desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Immunostaining and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed enhanced DSG2 localization and binding at cell borders upon EGFR inhibition. Enhanced area composita length and desmosome assembly were observed upon EGFR inhibition, confirmed by enhanced DSG2 and desmoplakin (DP) recruitment to cell borders. PamGene Kinase assay performed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes treated with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, revealed upregulation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Erlotinib-mediated desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion were abolished upon ROCK inhibition. Thus, inhibiting EGFR and, thereby, stabilizing desmosome integrity via ROCK might provide treatment options for AC."	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib

Here, we describe how the conjugation of valuable ginseng secondary metabolites (ginsenoside Rb1 or Rg1) with carbon nanotubes (CNT) can enhance their anti-proliferative and anti-cancer effects. Ginsenoside-CNT conjugate (Rb-CNT or Rg-CNT) permitted the ginsenosides to be used at a low dose, yet achieve a higher incidence of cancer killing. We were able to demonstrate that the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate can decrease cell viability up to 62% in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and enhance antiproliferation of drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) by 61%. The interaction of the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate with breast cancer cells was studied using Raman Spectroscopy mapping. Total transcriptome profiling (Affymetrix platform) of MCF-7 cells treated with the ginsenoside-CNT conjugate shows that a number of cellular, apoptotic and response to stimulus processes were affected. Therefore, our data confirmed the potential use of CNT as a drug delivery system."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		ginsenoside rb1
"PMID 36641437: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Aidi injection (ADI) is a representative antitumor medication based on Chinese herbal injection, but its antitumor mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, the subcutaneous xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was established in nude mice to investigate the anticancer effect of ADI in vivo. We then determined the components of ADI using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and explored the possible molecular mechanisms against pancreatic cancer using network pharmacology. In vivo experiments, the volume, weight, and degree of histological abnormalities of implanted tumors were significantly lower in the medium and high concentration ADI injection groups than in the control group. Network pharmacology analysis identified four active components of ADI and seven key targets, TNF, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, MAPK14, CASP3, P53 and JUN. Molecular docking also revealed high affinity between the active components and the target proteins, including Astragaloside IV to P53 and VEGFA, Ginsenoside Rb1 to CASP3 and Formononetin to JUN. ADI could reduce the growth rate of tumor tissue and alleviate the structural abnormalities in tumor tissue. ADI is predicted to act on VEGFA, P53, CASP3, and JUN in ADI-mediated treatment of pancreatic cancer."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		ginsenoside rb1
"PMID 19860666: Hedgehog signaling is aberrantly activated in glioma, medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and other tumors. Hedgehog signals activate GLI family members via Smoothened. RTK signaling potentiates GLI activity through PI3K-AKT-mediated GSK3 inactivation or RAS-STIL1-mediated SUFU inactivation, while GPCR signaling to Gs represses GLI activity through adenylate cyclase-mediated PKA activation. GLI activators bind to GACCACCCA motif to regulate transcription of GLI1, PTCH1, PTCH2, HHIP1, MYCN, CCND1, CCND2, BCL2, CFLAR, FOXF1, FOXL1, PRDM1 (BLIMP1), JAG2, GREM1, and Follistatin. Hedgehog signals are fine-tuned based on positive feedback loop via GLI1 and negative feedback loop via PTCH1, PTCH2, and HHIP1. Excessive positive feedback or collapsed negative feedback of Hedgehog signaling due to epigenetic or genetic alterations leads to carcinogenesis. Hedgehog signals induce cellular proliferation through upregulation of N-Myc, Cyclin D/E, and FOXM1. Hedgehog signals directly upregulate JAG2, indirectly upregulate mesenchymal BMP4 via FOXF1 or FOXL1, and also upregulate WNT2B and WNT5A. Hedgehog signals induce stem cell markers BMI1, LGR5, CD44 and CD133 based on cross-talk with WNT and/or other signals. Hedgehog signals upregulate BCL2 and CFLAR to promote cellular survival, SNAI1 (Snail), SNAI2 (Slug), ZEB1, ZEB2 (SIP1), TWIST2, and FOXC2 to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and PTHLH (PTHrP) to promote osteolytic bone metastasis. KAAD-cyclopamine, Mu-SSKYQ-cyclopamine, IPI-269609, SANT1, SANT2, CUR61414 and HhAntag are small-molecule inhibitors targeted to Smoothened, GANT58, GANT61 to GLI1 and GLI2, and Robot-nikinin to SHH.

"PMID 20024066: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the most widely characterized of the three vertebrate Hedgehog homologs, and is essential for proper embryonic development. Shh binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptch1), resulting in the de-repression of Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the activation of Gli2, which regulates the transcription of target genes that include Gli1 and Ptch1. Several synthetic and naturally occurring small-molecule modulators of Smo have been discovered. Shh-signaling antagonists that bind to Smo include cyclopamine, SANT1, and Cur-61414. Shh signaling agonists that bind to Smo include the synthetic small molecules purmorphamine and SAG. Small molecules that inhibit Shh signaling downstream of Smo, GANT58 and GANT61 have also been reported. Robotnikinin inhibits the Shh pathway by directly targeting Shh. Although progress has been made in understanding and modulating Shh signaling, fundamental aspects of Shh signal transduction remain obscure, including the mechanism(s) whereby Ptch1 regulates Smo activity. Small-molecule modulators of Shh signaling provide a means to regulate the activity of a pathway implicated in medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and developmental disorders. Several Shh inhibitors have not succeeded in the clinic for unknown reasons, but clinical trials in BCC and pancreatic cancer with the promising Smo antagonists GDC-0449 and IPI-926 are currently underway."	0.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
"PMID 27349387: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. The innovative treatments are required and now the cancer stem cells (CSCs) are expected to be an effective target for novel therapies. Therefore we investigated the significance of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the maintenance of CSC-like properties of pancreatic cancer cells, in order to discover the key molecules controlling their unique properties. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Capan-1 M9 were used for our experiments in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum. Sphere formation assay, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometric analysis and MTT cell viability assay were performed to investigate molecular signals and the efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of the Hh pathway significantly reduced the expression of stem cell marker CD133 and sphere formation, an index of self-renewal capacity, demonstrating the suppression of CSC-like properties. Moreover, the GLI inhibitor GANT61 induced greater reduction in sphere formation and cell viability of pancreatic cancer cells than the smoothened (SMO) inhibitor cyclopamine. This suggests that GLI transcription factors, but not SMO membrane protein, are the key molecules in the Hh pathway. The treatment using GANT61 in combination with the inhibition of mTOR, which is another key molecule in pancreatic CSCs, resulted in the efficient reduction of cell viability and sphere formation of an inhibitor-resistant cell line, showing the strong efficacy and wide range applicability to pancreatic CSC-like cells. Thus, this novel combination treatment could be useful for the control of pancreatic cancer by targeting pancreatic CSCs. This is the first report of the efficient elimination of pancreatic cancer stem-like cells by the double blockage of Hh/GLI and mTOR signaling."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
"PMID 24297612: The HH signaling pathway is a 'core' signal transduction pathway in pancreatic cancer that promotes the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancers via enhancing cell proliferation, increasing invasion and metastasis and protecting against apoptosis. In the present study, we found that HH signaling regulates autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells. Activation of HH signaling inhibits autophagy, while inhibition of the HH pathway induces autophagy. Although the role of autophagy in cell survival and apoptosis may depend on tumor type and the microenvironment, our data clearly demonstrated that GANT61-induced autophagy contributed to reduced viability and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro, and these effects were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA. We propose that HH signaling by regulating autophagy plays an important role in determining the cellular response to HH-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer and further investigation of the interaction between autophagy and HH signaling is particularly important."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
"PMID 31036756: Hedgehog signals are transduced through Patched receptors to the Smoothened (SMO)-SUFU-GLI and SMO-Gi-RhoA signaling cascades. MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as <i>BCL2, FOXA2, FOXE1, FOXF1, FOXL1, FOXM1, GLI1, HHIP, PTCH1</i> and <i>WNT2B</i>, in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis, immune evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired <i>SMO</i> mutations, <i>SUFU</i> deletions, <i>GLI2</i> amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/β-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione B and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing."	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
"PMID 10929917: This paper reviews the function of the mitochondria and the mechanisms by which nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause mitochondrial toxicity. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces rates of morbidity and mortality due to HIV disease. However, long-term treatment with these drugs may be associated with adverse effects. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and have become the cornerstone of HAART. Unfortunately, these drugs have also been shown to inhibit cellular polymerases, most notably mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Studies of the NRTIs in enzyme assays and cell cultures demonstrate the following hierarchy of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma inhibition: zalcitabine > didanosine > stavudine > lamivudine > zidovudine > abacavir. In vitro investigations have also documented impairment of the mitochondrial enzymes adenylate kinase and the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate translocator. Inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma and other mitochondrial enzymes can gradually lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular toxicity. The clinical manifestations of NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity resemble those of inherited mitochondrial diseases (ie, hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, myopathy, nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis). Fat redistribution syndrome, or HIV-associated lipodystrophy, is another side effect attributed in part to NRTI therapy. The morphologic and metabolic complications of this syndrome are similar to those of the mitochondrial disorder known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis: suggesting that this too may be related to mitochondrial toxicity. The pathophysiology of less common adverse effects of nucleoside analogue therapy, such as diabetes, ototoxicity, and retinal lesions, may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction but have not been adequately studied. NRTls can block both HIV reverse transcriptase and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Inhibition of the latter enzyme is the most likely cause of the adverse effects associated with these drugs."	0.0	Diabetes		stavudine

D:A:D is a prospective observational study of 33,389 HIV-infected patients; diabetes is a study end point. Poisson regression models were used to assess the relation between diabetes and exposure to cART after adjusting for known risk factors for diabetes, CD4 count, lipids, and lipodystrophy. Over 130,151 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), diabetes was diagnosed in 744 patients (incidence rate of 5.72 per 1,000 PYFU [95% CI 5.31-6.13]). The incidence of diabetes increased with cumulative exposure to cART, an association that remained significant after adjustment for potential risk factors for diabetes. The strongest relationship with diabetes was exposure to stavudine; exposures to zidovudine and didanosine were also associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Time-updated measurements of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were all associated with diabetes. Adjusting for each of these variables separately reduced the relationship between cART and diabetes slightly. Although lipodystrophy was significantly associated with diabetes, adjustment for this did not modify the relationship between cART and diabetes. Stavudine and zidovudine are significantly associated with diabetes after adjustment for risk factors for diabetes and lipids. Adjustment for lipodystrophy did not modify the relationship, suggesting that the two thymidine analogs probably directly contribute to insulin resistance, potentially through mitochondrial toxicity."	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine

We evaluated risk factors, adipocytokine levels, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles in HIV-infected adolescents with different lipodystrophy types. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 80 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents receiving PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy for ≥ 6 months. Patients underwent oral glucose tolerance tests and measurements of high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, resistin, insulin, and lipids. They were classified into 3 groups based on the clinical findings: no lipodystrophy, isolated lipoatrophy, and any lipohypertrophy (isolated lipohypertrophy or combined type). Of the 80 patients (median age, 16.7 years), 18 (22.5%) had isolated lipoatrophy, while 8 (10%) had any lipohypertrophy (four with isolated lipohypertrophy, and four with the combined type). In a multivariate analysis, longer exposure to stavudine (OR: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p = 0.005) and indinavir (OR: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p = 0.012) were associated with lipoatrophy, while longer exposure to didanosine (OR: 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.017) and indinavir (OR: 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21; p = 0.045) were associated with any lipohypertrophy.

Leptin and resistin levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, Matsuda index, or QUICKI (all p > 0.05). Abnormal glucose metabolism and dysregulation of adipocytokines were common in the HIV-infected adolescents with lipohypertrophy and the combined type. Preventive screening for cardiovascular diseases caused by metabolic alterations should be routinely performed."	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
"PMID 30720846: To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and their association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected adults in a rural sub-county hospital in Kenya. This was a descriptive survey of patient charts characterising cardiovascular risk among adult patients (> 18 years) at Ukwala sub-county hospital between June 2013 and January 2015. Post-stratification survey weights were applied to obtain prevalence levels. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for each variable related to cardiovascular risk factors were calculated using logistic regression models. Overall, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 0.4%, 0.3% of patients had had a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), 40.4% had pre-hypertension, while 10.4% had stage 1 and 2.9% stage 2 hypertension. Up to 14% of patients had elevated non-fasting total cholesterol levels. Factors associated with hypertension were male gender (AOR 1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), being over 40 years of age (AOR 1.78, <i>p</i> = 0.0001) and having an increased waist circumference (OR 2.56, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). Raised total cholesterol was more likely in those on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (AOR 2.2, p = 0.0042), azidothymidine (AZT) (AOR 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0004) and stavudine (D4T) -containing regimens (AOR 3.13, <i>p</i> = 0.0002). An elevated prevalence of undiagnosed cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and raised total cholesterol levels was found among people living with HIV. There was an association between raised total cholesterol and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) -based ART regimens. Our findings provide further rationale for integrating routine cardiovascular risk-factor screening into HIV-care services."	0.0	Diabetes		stavudine
"PMID 31304808: <b>Introduction</b>: Efficient antiretroviral-treatment (ART) generally allows control of HIV infection. However, persons-living-with-HIV (PLWH), when aging, present a high prevalence of metabolic diseases. <b>Area covered</b>: Altered adiposity, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, diabetes, and their consequences are prevalent in PLWH and could be partly related to ART. <b>Expert opinion</b>: At first, personal and lifestyle factors are involved in the onset of these complications. The persistence of HIV in tissue reservoirs could synergize with some ART and enhance metabolic disorders. Altered fat repartition, diagnosed as lipodystrophy, has been related to first-generation nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors (NRTIs) (stavudine zidovudine) and some protease inhibitors (PIs). Recently, use of some integrase-inhibitors (INSTI) resulted in weight/fat gain, which represents a worrisome unresolved situation. Lipid parameters were affected by some first-generation NRTIs, non-NRTIs (efavirenz) but also PIs boosted by ritonavir, with increased total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Insulin resistance is common associated with abdominal obesity. Diabetes incidence, high with first-generation-ART (zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine, indinavir) has declined with contemporary ART close to that of the general population. Metabolic syndrome, a dysmetabolic situation with central obesity and insulin resistance, and liver steatosis are common in PLWH and could indirectly result from ART-associated fat gain and insulin resistance. All these dysmetabolic situations increase the atherogenic cardiovascular risk."	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
"PMID 20510456: Diabetic individuals are more susceptible to infections and this seems to be related to impaired phagocyte function. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the first barrier to prevent respiratory infections. Leukotrienes (LTs) increase AM phagocytic activity via Fc gamma R. In this study, we compared AMs from diabetic and non-diabetic rats for phagocytosis via Fc gamma R and the roles of LTs and insulin. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by alloxan (42 mg/kg, i.v.); macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and IgG-opsonised sheep red blood cells (IgG-SRBC) were used as targets. LTs were added to the AMs 5 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC. AMs were treated with a LT synthesis inhibitor (zileuton, 10 microM), or antagonists of the LTB(4) receptor (CP105.696, 10 microM) or cys-LT receptor (MK571, 10 microM), 30 or 20 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC, respectively. We found that the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC by AMs from diabetic rats is impaired compared with non-diabetic rats. Treatment with the LT inhibitor/antagonists significantly reduced AM phagocytosis in non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. During the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC LTB(4) and LTC(4) were produced by AMs from both groups. The addition of exogenous LTB(4) or LTD(4) potentiated phagocytosis similarly in both groups. Phagocytosis was followed by the phosphorylation of PKC-delta, ERK and Akt. This was reduced by zileuton treatment in AMs from non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. The addition of insulin to AMs further increased the phagocytosis by increasing PKC-delta phosphorylation. These results suggest that the impaired phagocytosis found in AMs from diabetic rats is related to a deficient coupling of LTs to the Fc gamma R signaling cascade and that insulin has a key role in this coupling. An essential role for insulin in innate immunity is suggested."	1.0	Diabetes		zileuton
"PMID 12649539: The binding of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to the 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) is a prerequisite for subsequent formation of leukotrienes (LT) from arachidonic acid. We have shown that FLAP antagonist administration decreased proteinuria in glomerulonephritic patients. In this follow-up study, we assessed the role for FLAP in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with FLAP (BAY X-1005, 200 mg/kg) or 5-LO (Zileuton, 80 mg/Kg) antagonists. Proteinuria, renal function and LT production was assessed. We also determined protein permeability of cultured glomerular endothelial cells (which possess no 5-LO) by measuring their permeability to radiolabeled albumin with and without FLAP antagonists. FLAP mRNA levels increased dramatically in glomeruli from diabetic animals compared to controls. Inhibition of FLAP (but not inhibition of 5-LO) reduced proteinuria, with no effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Interestingly, diabetes-induced rises in urinary excretion and glomerular production of leukotrienes were not modified by the inhibitors. Increased FLAP expression in glomerular endothelial cells in culture was associated with an increase in albumin permeability, and this increase was abolished by FLAP antagonists. On the other hand, addition of LTA(4) led to increases in leukotriene formation and in permeability. This increase in permeability was also reduced by co-incubation with FLAP antagonists, whereas the increase in leukotriene synthesis was not modified. These results suggest a role for FLAP other than the activation of 5-LO, possibly in protein handling, and point to FLAP antagonists as anti-proteinuric agents."	1.0	Diabetes		zileuton
"PMID 35921984: Tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, delivered superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to selective GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonism in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These results have fueled mechanistic studies focused on understanding how tirzepatide achieves its therapeutic efficacy. Recently, we found that treatment with tirzepatide improves insulin sensitivity in humans with T2D and obese mice in concert with a reduction in circulating levels of branched-chain amino (BCAAs) and keto (BCKAs) acids, metabolites associated with development of systemic insulin resistance (IR) and T2D. Importantly, these systemic effects were found to be coupled to increased expression of BCAA catabolic genes in thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) in mice. These findings led us to hypothesize that tirzepatide may lower circulating BCAAs/BCKAs by promoting their catabolism in BAT. To address this question, we utilized a murine model of diet-induced obesity and employed stable-isotope tracer studies in combination with metabolomic analyses in BAT and other tissues. Treatment with tirzepatide stimulated catabolism of BCAAs/BCKAs in BAT, as demonstrated by increased labeling of BCKA-derived metabolites, and increases in levels of byproducts of BCAA breakdown, including glutamate, alanine, and 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid (3-HIB). Further, chronic administration of tirzepatide increased levels of multiple amino acids in BAT that have previously been shown to be elevated in response to cold exposure. Finally, chronic treatment with tirzepatide led to a substantial increase in several TCA cycle intermediates (α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate) in BAT. These findings suggest that tirzepatide induces a thermogenic-like amino acid profile in BAT, an effect that may account for reduced systemic levels of BCAAs in obese IR mice."	1.0	Diabetes		tirzepatide
"PMID 35914543: As the disease progresses, many patients with type 2 diabetes have difficulty in reaching treatment goals. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a novel GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared with dulaglutide in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel, active-controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted in 46 medical research centres and hospitals in Japan. Adults aged 20 years or older with type 2 diabetes who had discontinued oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy or were treatment-naïve were included. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or dulaglutide (0·75 mg) once per week using a computer-generated random sequence with an Interactive Web Response System. Participants were stratified based on baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (≤8·5% or >8·5%), baseline BMI (<25 or ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and washout of antidiabetic medication. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The starting dose of tirzepatide was 2·5 mg once per week for 4 weeks, which was then increased to 5 mg in the tirzepatide 5 mg treatment group. For the tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg treatment groups, increases by 2·5 mg occurred once every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. The primary endpoint was mean change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline at week 52 measured in the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861052. Between May 7, 2019, and March 31, 2021, 821 participants were assessed for study eligibility and 636 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of tirzepatide 5 mg (n=159), 10 mg (n=158), or 15 mg (n=160), or dulaglutide 0·75 mg (n=159). 615 (97%) participants completed the study and 21 (3%) discontinued. Participants had a mean age of 56·6 years (SD 10·3) and were mostly male (481 [76%]). At week 52, HbA<sub>1c</sub> decreased from baseline by a least squares mean of -2·4 (SE 0·1) for tirzepatide 5 mg, -2·6 (0·1) for tirzepatide 10 mg, -2·8 (0·1) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and -1·3 (0·1) for dulaglutide. Estimated mean treatment differences versus dulaglutide were -1·1 (95% CI -1·3 to -0·9) for tirzepatide 5 mg, -1·3 (-1·5 to -1·1) for tirzepatide 10 mg, and -1·5 (-1·71 to -1·4) for tirzepatide 15 mg (all p<0·0001). Tirzepatide was associated with dose-dependent reductions in bodyweight with a least square mean difference of -5·8 kg (SE 0·4; -7·8% reduction) for 5 mg, -8·5 kg (0·4; -11·0% reduction) for 10 mg, and -10·7 kg (0·4; -13·9% reduction) for 15 mg of tirzepatide compared with -0·5 kg (0·4; -0·7% reduction) for dulaglutide. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (19 [12%] participants in the 5 mg group vs 31 [20%] in the 10 mg group vs 32 [20%] in the 15 mg group all receiving tirzepatide vs 12 (8%) in the group receiving dulaglutide), constipation (24 [15%] vs 28 [18%] vs 22 [14%] vs 17 [11%]), and nasopharyngitis (29 [18%] vs 25 [16%] vs 22 [14%] vs 26 [16%]). The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (23 [4%] of 636). Tirzepatide was superior compared with dulaglutide for glycaemic control and reduction in bodyweight. The safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with that of GLP-1 receptor agonists, indicating a potential therapeutic use in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Eli Lilly and Company.

"PMID 35914542: Due to potential ethnic differences in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, new therapeutics need to be evaluated in Japanese patients. We aimed to assess the safety and glycaemic efficacy of tirzepatide as an add-on treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with stable doses of various oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapies. This multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial was conducted at 34 medical research centres and hospitals in Japan. Eligible participants were aged 20 years or older with inadequately controlled (HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥7·0% to <11·0%) type 2 diabetes and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy (sulfonylureas, biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinedione, glinides, or SGLT2 inhibitors) for at least 3 months (stable dose for ≥8 weeks before screening), had a BMI of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, and stable bodyweight (±5%) for at least 3 months before screening. After a 2-week screening and 2-week lead-in period, all participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 5, 10, or 15 mg of tirzepatide, administered once per week subcutaneously for 52 weeks followed by a 4 week safety follow-up period, using a computer-generated random sequence and interactive web response system, stratified by oral antihyperglycaemic medication group. All participants started receiving 2·5 mg tirzepatide and doses were escalated by 2·5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability during 52 weeks of treatment, assessed as incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861039. Between March 30, 2019, and Feb 16, 2021, with recruitment and enrolment continuing until Feb 4, 2020, 484 participants were assessed for eligibility and 443 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of tirzepatide (148 [33%] in the 5 mg group, 147 [33%] in the 10 mg group, and 148 [33%] in the 15 mg group). 398 (90%) participants completed the study and treatment. Most participants (343 [77%] of 443) had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent in the tirzepatide 15 mg group (125 [84%] of 148) than the 5 mg (109 [74%] of 148) and 10 mg groups (109 [74%] of 147). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events with tirzepatide were mild or moderate nasopharyngitis (75 [17%]), nausea (74 [17%]), constipation (54 [12%]), diarrhoea (51 [12%]), and decreased appetite (44 [10%]). At week 52, mean changes from baseline in bodyweight were -3·8 kg (SE 0·5; -5·1% reduction) in the 5 mg group, -7·5 kg (0·5; -10·1% reduction) in the 10 mg group, and -10·2 kg (0·5; -13·2% reduction) in the 15 mg group. Least squares mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline reduced from 8·5% (SE 0·1) to 6·0% (0·1) in the 5 mg tirzepatide group, from 8·6% (0·1) to 5·6% (0·1) in the 10 mg group, and from 8·6% (0·1) to 5·6% (0·1) in the 15 mg group at week 52. No adjudication-confirmed deaths were reported. Tirzepatide was well tolerated as an add-on to oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes and showed improvement in glycaemic control and bodyweight, irrespective of background oral antihyperglycaemic medication. Tirzepatide is a potential new treatment option for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with single oral antihyperglycaemic medication. Eli Lilly and Company.

"PMID 35830001: Tirzepatide (Mounjaro™) is a single molecule that combines dual agonism of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors. Native GIP and GLP-1 are incretin hormones that stimulate insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion. GIP also plays a role in nutrient and energy metabolism, while GLP-1 also delays gastric emptying, supresses appetite and improves satiety. Eli Lilly is developing tirzepatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, cardiovascular disorders in T2DM, heart failure, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, obstructive sleep apnoea and for reducing mortality/morbidity in obesity. In May 2022, tirzepatide received its first approval in the USA to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM, as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Tirzepatide is in phase III development for heart failure, obesity and cardiovascular disorders in T2DM, and in phase II development for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of tirzepatide leading to this first approval for T2DM."	1.0	Diabetes		tirzepatide
"PMID 35807558: The prevalence of obesity and diabetes is an increasing global problem, especially in developed countries, and is referred to as the twin epidemics. As such, advanced treatment approaches are needed. Tirzepatide, known as a 'twincretin', is a 'first-in-class' and the only dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonist, that can significantly reduce glycemic levels and improve insulin sensitivity, as well as reducing body weight by more than 20% and improving lipid metabolism. This novel anti-diabetic drug is a synthetic peptide analog of the human GIP hormone with a C<sub>20</sub> fatty-diacid portion attached which, via acylation technology, can bind to albumin in order to provide a dose of the drug, by means of subcutaneous injection, once a week, which is appropriate to its a half-life of about five days. Tirzepatide, developed by Eli Lilly, was approved, under the brand name Mounjaro, by the United States Food and Drug Administration in May 2022. This started the 'twincretin' era of enormously important and appealing dual therapeutic options for diabetes and obesity, as well as advanced management of closely related cardiometabolic settings, which constitute the leading cause of morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. Herein, we present the key characteristics of tirzepatide in terms of synthesis, structure, and activity, bearing in mind its advantages and shortcomings. Furthermore, we briefly trace the evolution of this kind of medical agent and discuss the development of clinical studies."	1.0	Diabetes		tirzepatide
