4	4	An epistatic interaction between the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOEɛ4) gene and the K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) genes has been previously reported to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these observations were largely from case-control studies with small sample sizes. To examine the interaction between APOEɛ4 and BCHE-K on 1) the risk of incident AD and 2) rates of change in brain volumes and cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD in a prospective cohort study. The study sample for survival analysis included 691 Caucasian participants (age at baseline, 58.4±9.9 years; follow-up time,16.9±9.7 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The neuroimaging sample included 302 participants with 1,388 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Cognitive performance was assessed in 703 participants over 4,908 visits. A total of 122 diagnoses (79 AD, 43 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) were identified. Participants with both APOEɛ4 and BCHE-K variants had a 3.7-fold greater risk of AD (Hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI=1.99-6.89, p < 0.001) compared to non-carriers of both genes (APOE ɛ4 x BCHE-K interaction p = 0.025). There was no APOE ɛ4-BCHE-K interaction effect on rate of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. The APOE and BCHE genes interact to influence risk of incident AD/MCI but not rates of brain atrophy and decline in cognitive performance before onset of cognitive impairment. This may suggest the epistatic interaction between APOE ɛ4 and BCHE-K on AD risk is disease stage-dependent.	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
7	7	Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatase and a key regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways. While PP2A dysfunction has been linked to human cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), PP2A regulation remains relatively poorly understood. It has been reported that the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) is inactivated by a single phosphorylation at the Tyr307 residue by tyrosine kinases such as v-Src. However, multiple mass spectrometry studies have revealed the existence of other putative PP2Ac phosphorylation sites in response to activation of Src and Fyn, two major Src family kinases (SFKs). Here, using PP2Ac phosphomutants and novel phosphosite-specific PP2Ac antibodies, we show that cellular pools of PP2Ac are instead phosphorylated on both Tyr127 and Tyr284 upon Src activation, and on Tyr284 following Fyn activation. We found these phosphorylation events enhanced the interaction of PP2Ac with SFKs. In addition, we reveal SFK-mediated phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Y284 promotes dissociation of the regulatory Bα subunit, altering PP2A substrate specificity; the phosphodeficient Y127/284F and Y284F PP2Ac mutants prevented SFK-mediated phosphorylation of Tau at the CP13 (pSer202) epitope, a pathological hallmark of AD, and SFK-dependent activation of ERK, a major growth regulatory kinase upregulated in many cancers. Our findings demonstrate a novel PP2A regulatory mechanism that challenges the existing dogma on the inhibition of PP2A catalytic activity by Tyr307 phosphorylation. We propose dysregulation of SFK signaling in cancer and AD can lead to alterations in PP2A phosphorylation and subsequent deregulation of key PP2A substrates, including ERK and Tau.	1.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
9	9	Increasing evidence links impaired brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence prompted a search for molecular players common to AD and diabetes mellitus (DM). The work incorporated studies based on a primary care-based cohort (pcb-Cohort) and a bioinformatics analysis to identify central nodes, that are key players in AD and insulin signaling (IS) pathways. The interactome for each of these key proteins was retrieved and network maps were developed for AD and IS. Synaptic enrichment was performed to reveal synaptic common hubs. Cohort analysis showed that individuals with DM exhibited a correlation with poor performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test. Additionally, APOE ɛ2 allele carriers appear to potentially be relatively more protected against both DM and cognitive deficits. Ten clusters were identified in this network and 32 key synaptic proteins were common to AD and IS. Given the relevance of signaling pathways, another network was constructed focusing on protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and the top 6 kinase nodes (LRRK2, GSK3B, AKT1, EGFR, MAPK1, and FYN) were further analyzed. This allowed the elaboration of signaling cascades directly impacting AβPP and tau, whereby distinct signaling pathway play a major role and strengthen an AD-IS link at a molecular level.	0.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
10	10	Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common single-gene cause of congenital heart disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder that also features proportionate short stature, facial abnormalities, and an increased risk of myeloproliferative disease. Germline-activating mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause about half of NS cases; other causative alleles include KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1 mutants. We showed previously that knock-in mice bearing the NS mutant Ptpn11(D61G) on a mixed 129S4/SvJae X C57BL6/J background exhibit all major NS features, including a variety of cardiac defects, with variable penetrance. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NS cardiac defects and whether genetic background and/or the specific NS mutation contribute to the NS phenotype remained unclear. Here, using an inducible knock-in approach, we show that all cardiac defects in NS result from mutant Shp2 expression in the endocardium, not in the myocardium or neural crest. Furthermore, the penetrance of NS defects is affected by genetic background and the specific Ptpn11 allele. Finally, ex vivo assays and pharmacological approaches show that NS mutants cause cardiac valve defects by increasing Erk MAPK activation, probably downstream of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases, extending the interval during which cardiac endocardial cells undergo endocardial-mesenchymal transformation. Our data provide a mechanistic underpinning for the cardiac defects in this disorder.	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
13	13	Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease and facial dysmorphia with an incidence of 1/1000 to 2500 live births. Up to now, several genes have been proven to be involved in the disturbance of the transduction signal through the RAS-MAP Kinase pathway and the manifestation of Noonan syndrome. The first gene described was <i>PTPN11</i>, followed by <i>SOS1</i>, <i>RAF1</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and <i>RIT1</i>, and recently <i>SOS2</i>, <i>LZTR1</i>, and <i>A2ML1</i>, among others. Progressively, the physiopathology and molecular etiology of most signs of Noonan syndrome have been demonstrated, and inheritance patterns as well as genetic counseling have been established. In this review, we summarize the data concerning clinical features frequently observed in Noonan syndrome, and then, we describe the molecular etiology as well as the physiopathology of most Noonan syndrome-causing genes. In the second part of this review, we assess the mutational rate of Noonan syndrome-causing genes reported up to now in most screening studies. This review should give clinicians as well as geneticists a full view of the molecular aspects of Noonan syndrome and the authentic prevalence of the mutational events of its causing-genes. It will also facilitate laying the groundwork for future molecular diagnosis research, and the development of novel treatment strategies.	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
15	15	Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension, inflammation, renal disease progression, and cardiovascular disease. However, no data are available regarding the effect of allopurinol in patients with chronic kidney disease. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of 113 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) <60 ml/min. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with allopurinol 100 mg/d (n = 57) or to continue the usual therapy (n = 56). Clinical, biochemical, and inflammatory parameters were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment. The objectives of study were (1) renal disease progression; (2) cardiovascular events; and (3) hospitalizations of any causes. Serum uric acid and C-reactive protein levels were significantly decreased in subjects treated with allopurinol. In the control group, eGFR decreased 3.3 +/- 1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and in the allopurinol group, eGFR increased 1.3 +/- 1.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) after 24 months. Allopurinol treatment slowed down renal disease progression independently of age, gender, diabetes, C-reactive protein, albuminuria, and renin-angiotensin system blockers use. After a mean follow-up time of 23.4 +/- 7.8 months, 22 patients suffered a cardiovascular event. Diabetes mellitus, previous coronary heart disease, and C-reactive protein levels increased cardiovascular risk. Allopurinol treatment reduces risk of cardiovascular events in 71% compared with standard therapy. Allopurinol decreases C-reactive protein and slows down the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, allopurinol reduces cardiovascular and hospitalization risk in these subjects.	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR	
17	17	The usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria for prediction of cardiovascular outcomes is controversial. We aimed to assess the addition of creatinine-based eGFR and albuminuria to traditional risk factors for prediction of cardiovascular risk with a meta-analytic approach. We meta-analysed individual-level data for 637 315 individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease from 24 cohorts (median follow-up 4·2-19·0 years) included in the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium. We assessed C statistic difference and reclassification improvement for cardiovascular mortality and fatal and non-fatal cases of coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure in a 5 year timeframe, contrasting prediction models for traditional risk factors with and without creatinine-based eGFR, albuminuria (either albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] or semi-quantitative dipstick proteinuria), or both. The addition of eGFR and ACR significantly improved the discrimination of cardiovascular outcomes beyond traditional risk factors in general populations, but the improvement was greater with ACR than with eGFR, and more evident for cardiovascular mortality (C statistic difference 0·0139 [95% CI 0·0105-0·0174] for ACR and 0·0065 [0·0042-0·0088] for eGFR) and heart failure (0·0196 [0·0108-0·0284] and 0·0109 [0·0059-0·0159]) than for coronary disease (0·0048 [0·0029-0·0067] and 0·0036 [0·0019-0·0054]) and stroke (0·0105 [0·0058-0·0151] and 0·0036 [0·0004-0·0069]). Dipstick proteinuria showed smaller improvement than ACR. The discrimination improvement with eGFR or ACR was especially evident in individuals with diabetes or hypertension, but remained significant with ACR for cardiovascular mortality and heart failure in those without either of these disorders. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, the combination of eGFR and ACR for risk discrimination outperformed most single traditional predictors; the C statistic for cardiovascular mortality fell by 0·0227 (0·0158-0·0296) after omission of eGFR and ACR compared with less than 0·007 for any single modifiable traditional predictor. Creatinine-based eGFR and albuminuria should be taken into account for cardiovascular prediction, especially when these measures are already assessed for clinical purpose or if cardiovascular mortality and heart failure are outcomes of interest. ACR could have particularly broad implications for cardiovascular prediction. In populations with chronic kidney disease, the simultaneous assessment of eGFR and ACR could facilitate improved classification of cardiovascular risk, supporting current guidelines for chronic kidney disease. Our results lend some support to also incorporating eGFR and ACR into assessments of cardiovascular risk in the general population.

18	18	Shixiao San (SXS) is a traditional Chinese formula that has been widely used in clinical practice to treat blood stasis syndromes, such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic, thrombosis and coronary heart disease. However, the effectiveness and mechanism of SXS have not been studied in detail yet. Current study aimed to identify the compounds in SXS, evaluate the formula efficacies using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and verify the pharmacological effects by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The compounds in SXS were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF-MS. Potential target genes for identified compounds were obtained from three databases. DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. PPI network was constructed to screen core targets. Molecular docking was used to examine interactions between active compounds and potential targets. The mechanism was also verified by model of acute blood stasis rats and human umbilical vein cells. In total, 45 compounds were identified from SXS. Among the detected phytochemicals, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, D-catechin, naringenin and amentoflavone were identified as the active constituents. SXS is primarily involved in the modulation of hypoxic state, vascular regulation, and inflammation response, according to GO and KGG pathway enrichment analysis. A network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was constructed and five core targets were identified as VEGFA, AKT1, EGFR, PTGS2, and MMP9. Molecular docking simulation revealed good binding affinity of the five putative targets with the corresponding compounds. SXS reduced HIF-1α and COX-2 levels and increased the eNOS expression levels in hypoxic HUVECs. SXS can reduce the whole blood viscosity in adrenaline induced acute blood stasis rats and relieve blood stasis. SXS removes blood stasis might through VEGFA/AKT/eNOS/COX-2 pathway and flavonoids are the main active components in the formula.	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR	
23	23	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease. The literature suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and it can modulate the synthesis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Previous studies have shown that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme of oxidative stress, TNF-α is involved in the formation of insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress and insulin resistance are the key factors for the formation of NAFLD. Therefore, it can be said that AHR may participate in contributing to NAFLD by regulating CYP1A1 and TNF-α. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is an effective AHR inhibitor. The present study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of ANF in high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. Mice were fed HFD to induce NAFLD, HepG2 cells were exposed to OA to induce hepatocyte injury, and ANF significantly reduced mouse and cellular liver damage compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD and OA-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. ANF treatment reduces liver damage by reducing ROS and IR, the data show that ANF inhibits the expression of AHR, CYP1A1 and TNF-α in NAFLD. Taken together, these findings show that ANF alleviate NAFLD via regulation of AHR/CYP1A1 and AHR/TNF-α pathways, which may have potential for further development as novel therapeutic agents for NAFLD.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
24	24	Inflammation, an old medical problem, is being recognized as an active, well orchestrated biological process. When dysregulated, chronic inflammation may ensue, leading to tissue-dependent diseases. Depending upon the ligand and cellular context, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may accelerate or attenuate inflammation and subsequent resolution. Three examples are discussed in which AHR modulates inflammation by a mixture of genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways (i) AHR-agonistic bacterial virulence factors are leading to both microbial defense and resolution of inflammatory responses. (ii) TCDD-mediated persistent AHR activation initially leads to inflammation by non-genomic signaling, and may potentially lead to chronic inflammation. (iii) AHR may modulate anti-inflammatory actions in obesity-mediated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Hepatic lipotoxicity triggers generation of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that facilitate the development of hepatitis. AHR is mainly involved in the resolution phase by induction of lipoxin A4 and Il-22. Moderate AHR activation by phytochemicals and microbial AHR ligands may facilitate resolution. In control of inflammation, AHR appears to integrate environmental conditions with coordinated cellular functions.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
25	25	In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and involved mechanisms of resveratrol on an established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) murine model. Wild-type and autophagic mediator ULK1 heterozygous knockout mice were induced to have NAFLD by high-fat diet for 8weeks. After that, resveratrol treatment was applied with the high-fat diet feeding for another 4weeks. Typical features of NAFLD, including histological changes, fibrosis, insulin resistance, oxidative status, and inflammation were characterized. After-treatment with resveratrol showed ameliorative effects on all measured features of NAFLD, from histology, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance to oxidative stress and inflammation. resveratrol treatment also reduced the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through the restoration of its inhibitor IκBα. Partial inhibition of ULK1 expression impaired the ameliorative effects of resveratrol on hepatic histology, fibrosis, oxidative status, inflammation, and NF-κB activity. In conclusion, resveratrol improved NAFLD-caused hepatic injury partially through regulating autophagic and IκBα-NF-κB pathways.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
26	26	Autophagy is essential for cellular survival and energy homeostasis under nutrient deprivation. Despite the emerging importance of nuclear events in autophagy regulation, epigenetic control of autophagy gene transcription remains unclear. Here, we report fasting-induced Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21) signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via Jumonji-D3 (JMJD3/KDM6B) histone demethylase. Upon FGF21 signaling, JMJD3 epigenetically upregulates global autophagy-network genes, including Tfeb, Atg7, Atgl, and Fgf21, through demethylation of histone H3K27-me3, resulting in autophagy-mediated lipid degradation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of JMJD3 at Thr-1044 by FGF21 signal-activated PKA increases its nuclear localization and interaction with the nuclear receptor PPARα to transcriptionally activate autophagy. Administration of FGF21 in obese mice improves defective autophagy and hepatosteatosis in a JMJD3-dependent manner. Remarkably, in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, hepatic expression of JMJD3, ATG7, LC3, and ULK1 is substantially decreased. These findings demonstrate that FGF21-JMJD3 signaling epigenetically links nutrient deprivation with hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation in mammals.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
27	27	Accumulating evidence suggests a role of bisphenol A (BPA) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of lipogenic genes, but the mechanism of BPA induced lipogenic gene expression remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 μg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For 5 weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in liver, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased liver lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in liver of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins were also significantly increased, and ERα protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB pathways.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
31	31	In the last decade, substantial efforts have been made to identify NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis inhibitors, specifically against nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), as preclinical studies indicate their potential efficacy as cancer drugs. However, the clinical activity of NAMPT inhibitors has proven limited, suggesting that alternative NAD<sup>+</sup> production routes exploited by tumors confer resistance. Here, we show the gene encoding nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a second NAD<sup>+</sup>-producing enzyme, is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of common types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, where NAPRT expression correlates with a BRCAness gene expression signature. Both NAPRT and NAMPT increased intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. NAPRT silencing reduced energy status, protein synthesis, and cell size in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. NAPRT silencing sensitized cells to NAMPT inhibitors both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>; similar results were obtained with the NAPRT inhibitor 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. Reducing NAPRT levels in a BRCA2-deficient cancer cell line exacerbated DNA damage in response to chemotherapeutics. In conclusion, NAPRT-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis contributes to cell metabolism and to the DNA repair process in a subset of tumors. This knowledge could be used to increase the efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors and chemotherapy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3857-69. ©2017 AACR</i>.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT	
33	33	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal diseases for which chemotherapy has not been very successful yet. FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) is a well-known NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) inhibitor with anti-cancer activities, but it failed in phase II clinical trials. We found that FK866 shows anti-proliferative activity in three PDAC cell lines, as well as in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells. More than 50 FK866 analogues were synthesized that introduce substituents on the phenyl ring of the piperidine benzamide group of FK866 and exchange its buta-1,4-diyl tether for 1-oxyprop-3-yl, (E)-but-2-en-1,4-diyl and 2- and 3-carbon tethers. The pyridin-3-yl moiety of FK866 was exchanged for chlorinated and fluorinated analogues and for pyrazin-2-yl and pyridazin-4-yl groups. Several compounds showed low nanomolar or sub-nanomolar cell growth inhibitory activity. Our best cell anti-proliferative compounds were the 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzamide analogue of FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-(2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoyl)piperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) (9), the 2,6-dimethoxybenzamide (8) and 2-methoxybenzamide (4), which exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.16 nM, 0.004 nM and 0.08 nM toward PDAC cells, respectively.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT	
36	36	The function of a new long non-coding RNA linc00673 remains unclear. While identified as an oncogenic player in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), linc00673 was found to be anti-oncogenic in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However whether linc00673 regulated malignancy and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has not been characterized. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch assays and transwell invasion assays. Epithelial mesenchymal transition was examined using western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Interaction between miRNA and linc00673 was determined using luciferase reporter assays. In vivo experiments were performed to assess tumor formation. In addition, the expression data of NSCLC specimens of TCGA and patient survival data were utilized to explore the prognostic significance of linc00673. In the present study, we found high linc00673 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. In vitro experiments showed linc00673 knockdown reversed TGF-β induced EMT, and miR-150-5p was predicted to target linc00673 through bioinformatics tools. Overexpression of miR-150-5p suppressed lin00673's expression while inhibition of miR-150-5p led to significant upregulation of lin00673, suggesting that linc00673 could be negatively regulated by miR-150-5p, which was further confirmed by the inverse correlation between linc00673 and miR-150-5p in NSCLC patients' specimen. Furthermore, we proved that miR-150-5p could directly target linc00673 through luciferase assay, so linc00673 could sponge miR-150-5p and modulate the expression of a key EMT regulator ZEB1 indirectly. In addition, miR-150-5p inhibition abrogated linc00673 silence mediated proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT suppressing effect. Moreover, the inhibition of linc00673 significantly attenuated the tumorigenesis ability of A549 cells in vivo. We validated linc00673 as a novel oncogenic lncRNA and demonstrated the molecular mechanism by which it promotes NSCLC, which will advance our understanding of its clinical significance.	0.0	Pancreatic cancer	CCK	
38	38	Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation is considered to be the event that leads to the initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the mutation frequency of the KRAS gene in PDAC is 90‑95%. Studies have shown that wild‑type KRAS (KRAS<sup>WT</sup>) has a survival advantage in PDAC and can antagonize the effect of mutated KRAS G12D (KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>), leading to a low cell transformation efficiency. The present study focused on the differences in biological behavior between KRAS<sup>WT</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and explored the mechanism in pancreatic cancer. Overexpressed KRAS<sup>WT</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> was transfected into cells through lentiviral transfection. The differences and mechanisms were explored using cell counting kit‑8 (CCK‑8), clone formation, wound healing and Transwell assays, as well as western blotting, immunohistochemistry and tumor formation in nude mice. <i>In vitro</i>, the proliferation of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was reduced compared with PANC‑1 group, while the proliferation of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group was not significantly changed. <i>In vivo</i>, the proliferation of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was reduced and that of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group was enhanced compared with that in the PANC‑1 group. The invasion and migration of KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group were decreased, while the invasion and migration of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group were increased. Western blotting showed that the expression of E‑cadherin, α‑E‑catenin, MMP‑3, MMP‑9, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group was increased, while no significant difference was observed in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group. The results of immunohistochemistry were consistent with those of western blotting. KRAS<sup>WT</sup> group can inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> group can significantly promote proliferation <i>in vivo</i>, but not significantly in vitro. Wild‑type KRAS may inhibit the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer through the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.	0.0	Pancreatic cancer	CCK	
41	41	Previous studies indicate that androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease among older men. We evaluated the relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men of all ages with prostate cancer. We conducted an observational study of 37,443 population-based men who were diagnosed with local or regional prostate cancer in the Veterans Healthcare Administration from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2004, with follow-up through December 31, 2005. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess whether androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, oral antiandrogens, the combination of the two (ie, combined androgen blockade), or orchiectomy was associated with diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or stroke, after adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. Overall, 14,597 (39%) of the 37,443 patients were treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Treatment with GnRH agonists was associated with statistically significantly increased risks of incident diabetes (for GnRH agonist therapy, 159.4 events per 1000 person-years vs 87.5 events for no androgen deprivation therapy, difference = 71.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 71.6 to 72.2; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.38), incident coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.28), myocardial infarction (12.8 events per 1000 person-years for GnRH agonist therapy vs 7.3 for no androgen deprivation therapy, difference = 5.5, 95% CI = 5.4 to 5.6; aHR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.52), sudden cardiac death (aHR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.54), and stroke (aHR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.36). Combined androgen blockade was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.53), and orchiectomy was associated with coronary heart disease (aHR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.87) and myocardial infarction (aHR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.27 to 3.50). Oral antiandrogen monotherapy was not associated with any outcome studied. Androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH agonists was associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.	0.0	Diabetes	AHR	
42	42	Subjects with diabetes are at higher risk of serious influenza-related complications. We aimed to investigate the yearly trend of influenza vaccination and factors associated with being unvaccinated for influenza in subjects with diabetes using a nationwide observational study performed within the recent decade. Among 105,732 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2019, 8,632 with diabetes were included. We investigated the yearly trend of influenza vaccination and factors associated with being unvaccinated for influenza. During the study period, the prevalence of influenza vaccination in subjects with diabetes showed a tendency to increase every year, reaching almost 60% in 2019, which was higher than the rate in subjects without diabetes. Younger age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95% CI] 11.29 [8.63-14.75] for < 50 years; 6.16 [5.21-7.29] for 50-65 years), male (aHR 1.67 [1.52-1.87]), current smoker (aHR 1.31 [1.00-1.72], lower-income status (aHR 1.46 [1.17, 1.84]), and high education level (aHR 1.30 [1.01-1.67]) were associated with being unvaccinated. Also, a poorer glycemic control with HbA1c ≥ 9% was found to be correlated with unvaccinated status (aHR 1.48 [1.15-1.90]). The influenza vaccination rate is still unsatisfactory in subjects with diabetes. Young age, males, low-income level, high education level, and poor glycemic control were associated with unvaccinated status. Considering the risk-benefits of influenza vaccination in patients with diabetes, physicians should make an effort to increase vaccination rates, especially in low vaccination rate groups.	0.0	Diabetes	AHR	
43	43	Cancer is a major health problem in the U.S and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is known to increase the risk for the development of many cancers. Metformin, a first-line therapy for treating T2DM, is increasingly being used for its anticancer effects; however, the literature is limited on the effect of metformin dose on overall survival in patients with stage IV cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to the last known follow-up or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive on December 31, 2016 were censored. In this cohort study we examined the relationship between metformin dose and overall survival in persons with both T2DM and stage IV lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreas cancers. We used a retrospective study design with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 2007-2016 of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER) dataset. Of the 7,725 patients, 2,981(38.5%) had been prescribed metformin. Patients who used metformin had significantly better overall survival in both unadjusted (Unadjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76; p < 0.001) and adjusted models (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.81; p < 0.001). The overall survival between patients who took metformin with average daily dose ≥ 1000mg or < 1000mg were not statistically significant (aHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.08; p = 0.90). Metformin use regardless of dose is associated with increased overall survival in older adults with stage IV cancer.	0.0	Diabetes	AHR	
45	45	Although inflammation has long been known as a localized protective reaction of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection, characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function, there has been a new realization about its role in a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. While acute inflammation is a part of the defense response, chronic inflammation can lead to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological diseases. Several pro-inflammatory gene products have been identified that mediate a critical role in suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Among these gene products are TNF and members of its superfamily, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, chemokines, MMP-9, VEGF, COX-2, and 5-LOX. The expression of all these genes are mainly regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is constitutively active in most tumors and is induced by carcinogens (such as cigarette smoke), tumor promoters, carcinogenic viral proteins (HIV-tat, HIV-nef, HIV-vpr, KHSV, EBV-LMP1, HTLV1-tax, HPV, HCV, and HBV), chemotherapeutic agents, and gamma-irradiation. These observations imply that anti-inflammatory agents that suppress NF-kappaB or NF-kappaB-regulated products should have a potential in both the prevention and treatment of cancer. The current review describes in detail the critical link between inflammation and cancer.	1.0	Diabetes	LOX	
46	46	Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, β-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-κB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-β, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.	1.0	Diabetes	LOX	
47	47	Diabetic bone disease is a complication of type I and type II diabetes, both of which are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. Increased hip and foot fracture rates do not correlate well with changes in bone mineral density (BMD), whereas studies support the importance of collagen structure to bone strength. Extracellular lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens resulting in aldehydes that subsequently form critically important biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. Although LOX-dependent biosynthetic crosslinks in bone collagen are deficient in diabetic bone, the expression and regulation of bone LOXs in diabetes have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. Moreover, we have identified a novel metabolic regulatory relationship that is dysregulated in diabetes using mouse models. Data indicate that the incretin (gastric hormone) known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that is anabolic to osteoblasts strongly upregulates LOX, and that this regulation is disrupted in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in mice. In vivo and in vitro studies support that diabetes results in elevated circulating peripheral dopamine, likely also derived from the gut, and is responsible for blocking GIP signaling and LOX levels in osteoblasts. Moreover, peripheral administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride to diabetic mice restored trabecular bone structure to near normal and partially reversed downregulation of LOX. Taken together our data identifies a novel metabolic relationship between the gut-derived hormone GIP and bone-derived LOX, and points to the importance of LOX dysregulation in the pathology of diabetic bone disease. © 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.	0.0	Diabetes	LOX	
50	50	The gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, is a target for the development of therapeutic agents to address type 2 diabetes and obesity. Signal transduction processes mediated by GPCR activation typically result in receptor phosphorylation, but very little is known about GIPR phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for detecting phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of proteins and for identifying modification sites. However, applying MS methods to GPCRs is challenging because the native expression levels are low and the hydrophobicity of these proteins complicates isolation and enrichment. Here we use a widely available technique, trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOF MS), to characterize the phosphorylation status of the GIPR. We identified eight serine residues that are phosphorylated, one in an intracellular loop and the remainder in the C-terminal domain. Stimulation with the native agonist GIP enhanced phosphorylation at four of these sites. For comparison, we evaluated tirzepatide (TZP), a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the GIPR that has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Stimulation with TZP enhanced phosphorylation at the same four sites that were enhanced with GIP; however, TZP also enhanced phosphorylation at a fifth site that is unique to this synthetic agonist. This work establishes an important and accessible tool for the characterization of signal transduction via the GIPR and reveals an unanticipated functional difference between GIP and TZP.	1.0	Diabetes	GIPR

In the recent SURMOUNT 2 trial, Garvey and colleagues set out to examine the weight loss efficacy of the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist tirzepatide in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, reporting that tirzepatide has unprecedented efficacy in a magnitude historically considered almost unattainable.<sup>1</sup>.	0.0	Diabetes	GIPR	
53	53	Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has a role in controlling postprandial metabolic tone. In humans, a GIP receptor (GIPR) variant (Q354, rs1800437) is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and increased risk for Type 2 Diabetes. To better understand the impacts of GIPR-Q354 on metabolism, it is necessary to study it in an isogeneic background to the predominant GIPR isoform, E354. To accomplish this objective, we used CRISPR-CAS9 editing to generate mouse models of GIPR-Q354 and GIPR-E354. Here we characterize the metabolic effects of GIPR-Q354 variant in a mouse model (GIPR-Q350). We generated the GIPR-Q350 mice for in vivo studies of metabolic impact of the variant. We isolated pancreatic islets from GIPR-Q350 mice to study insulin secretion ex vivo. We used a β-cell cell line to understand the impact of the GIPR-Q354 variant on the receptor traffic. We found that female GIPR-Q350 mice are leaner than littermate controls, and male GIPR-Q350 mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, in line with the association of the variant with reduced BMI in humans. GIPR-Q350 mice of both sexes are more glucose tolerant and exhibit an increased sensitivity to GIP. Postprandial GIP levels are reduced in GIPR-Q350 mice, revealing feedback regulation that balances the increased sensitivity of GIP target tissues to secretion of GIP from intestinal endocrine cells. The increased GIP sensitivity is recapitulated ex vivo during glucose stimulated insulin secretion assays in islets. Generation of cAMP in islets downstream of GIPR activation is not affected by the Q354 substitution. However, post-activation traffic of GIPR-Q354 variant in β-cells is altered, characterized by enhanced intracellular dwell time and increased localization to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN). Our data link altered intracellular traffic of the GIPR-Q354 variant with GIP control of metabolism. We propose that this change in spatiotemporal signaling underlies the physiologic effects of GIPR-Q350/4 and GIPR-E350/4 in mice and humans. These findings contribute to a more complete understanding of the impact of GIPR-Q354 variant on glucose homeostasis that could perhaps be leveraged to enhance pharmacologic targeting of GIPR for the treatment of metabolic disease.	1.0	Diabetes	GIPR	
57	57	Protective efficacy of N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) was assessed against sub-acute diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP) poisoning in mice. Mice were allocated into nine groups of six each vehicle control; DFP (0.125 LD<sub>50</sub> ≈ 0.483 mg/kg bwt, s.c.); DFP + Atropine (ATR, 10 mg/kg bwt, i.p., 0 min); DFP + Pralidoxime (2-PAM, 30 mg/kg bwt, i.m., 0 min); DFP + NAC (150 mg/kg bwt, i.p., -60 min); DFP + ATR + NAC; DFP + 2-PAM + NAC; DFP + ATR + 2-PAM; and DFP + ATR + 2-PAM + NAC. Animals received various treatments for 21 d daily. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was measured after 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured (brain, liver and kidney) after 21 d of exposure. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and c-fos were also performed. DFP significantly reduced BChE and AChE levels. Diminished GSH, CAT, SOD (brain and liver), GPx, GR, and elevated MDA (Brain) levels were also observed. DFP caused notable histopathology (brain, liver and kidney) and over expression of iNOS, and c-fos proteins (brain). NAC enhanced the protective efficacy of ATR and 2-PAM in most parameters, without any appreciable protection in iNOS and c-fos expression. NAC as an adjunct with ATR and 2-PAM, exhibited marked beneficial effects against sub-acute DFP poisoning, indicating its possible implications in the management of OP poisoning.	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
59	59	Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is a stoichiometric bioscavenger that protects from the toxicity of nerve agents. Non-human primates are suitable models for toxicity studies that cannot be performed in humans. We evaluated the biochemical properties of native macaque (MaBChE) tetramers, compared to recombinant MaBChE monomers, PEGylated recombinant MaBChE tetramers and monomers, and native HuBChE tetramers. K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values for butyrylthiocholine were independent of subunit assembly status. The K<sub>m</sub> for all forms of MaBChE was about 70 μM, compared to 13 μM for HuBChE. The k<sub>cat</sub> was about 100,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for MaBChE and 30,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for HuBChE. The reversible inhibitor ethopropazine had similar K<sub>i</sub> values of 0.05 μM for all MaBChE forms and HuBChE. The bimolecular rate constant, ki, for inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog of sarin, was 2.2 to 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> for all MaBChE forms and for HuBChE. A major difference between MaBChE and HuBChE was the rate of reactivation by 2-PAM. The second order rate constant for reactivation of DFP-inhibited MaBChE by 2-PAM was 1.4 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, but was 380 fold faster for DFP-inhibited HuBChE (k<sub>r</sub> 531 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>). The acyl pocket of MaBChE has Leu285 in place of Pro285 in HuBChE. The reactivation rate of DFP-inhibited HuBChE mutant P285L by 2-PAM was reduced 5.8-fold (k<sub>r</sub> 92 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) indicating that P285 determines whether 2-PAM binds in an orientation that favors release of diisopropylphosphate. DFP-inhibited MaBChE treated with 0.2 M 2-PAM recovered 10% of its original activity, whereas DFP-inhibited HuBChE recovered 80% activity. It was concluded that the biochemical properties of MaBChE are similar to those of HuBChE except for the reactivation of DFP-inhibited BChE.	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
62	62	Major surgery induces systemic inflammation leading to pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Endothelial inflammation is one of the drivers of postoperative organ damage, including acute kidney injury Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) is an important component of surgery-induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Kinases, the backbone of signalling cascades, can be targeted by pharmacological inhibition. This is a promising treatment option to interfere with excessive endothelial inflammation. In this study, we identified activated kinases as potential therapeutic targets. These targets were pharmacologically inhibited to reduce TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells. Kinome profiling using PamChip arrays identified 64 protein tyrosine kinases and 88 serine-threonine kinases, the activity of which was determined at various timepoints (5-240 min) following stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. The PTKs Axl and Fyn were selected based on high kinase activity profiles. Co-localisation experiments with the endothelial-specific protein CD31 showed Axl expression in endothelial cells of glomeruli and Fyn in arterioles and glomeruli of both control and TNF-α-exposed mice. Pharmacological inhibition with Axl inhibitor BMS-777607 and Fyn inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory activation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 at mRNA and VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 at protein level in HUVEC <i>in vitro</i>. Upon pharmacological inhibition with each inhibitor, leukocyte adhesion to HUVEC was also significantly reduced, however to a minor extent. In conclusion, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with kinase inhibitors BMS-777607 and PP2 reduces TNF-α-induced endothelial inflammation <i>in vitro</i>.	1.0		FYN	PP2
66	66	Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The ability of miR-7 to enhance gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was evaluated in this study. We found that miR-7 significantly decreased the IC50 of gefitinib and inhibited cell growth. G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were increased after the treatment of gefitinib coupled with miR-7 transfection. In addition, levels of Raf1, IGF1R, and PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK were also significantly decreased. Our results suggest that miR-7 may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLCs.	1.0		RAF1	gefitinib
68	68	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). However, suppression of EGFR did not improve the patient outcome, possibly due to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in PCa. Compounds able to suppress both PI3K/Akt and EGFR signaling may be effective for treating advanced PCa. We examined if caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) simultaneously suppresses the EGFR and Akt signaling, migration and tumor growth in PCa cells. Wound healing assay, transwell migration assay and xenograft mice model were used to determine the effects of CAPE on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to determine the effects of CAPE on EGFR and Akt signaling. CAPE treatment decreased the gene expression of HRAS, RAF1, AKT2, GSK3A, and EGF and the protein expression of phospho-EGFR (Y845, Y1069, Y1148, Y1173), phospho-FAK, Akt, and ERK1/2 in PCa cells. CAPE treatment inhibited the EGF-induced migration of PCa cells. Combined treatment of CAPE with EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed additive inhibition on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Injection of CAPE (15 mg/kg/3 days) for 14 days suppressed the tumor growth of prostate xenografts in nude mice as well as suppressed the levels of Ki67, phospho-EGFR Y845, MMP-9, phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Ras, and Raf-1 in prostate xenografts. Our study suggested that CAPE can simultaneously suppress the EGFR and Akt signaling in PCa cells and is a potential therapeutic agent for advanced PCa.	0.0		RAF1	gefitinib
69	69	The abnormal expression of SEC61G plays an important role in the development of various tumors. This study explored the effects of SEC61G on MAPK signaling pathway and proliferation of cervical cancer (CC) cells. shRNA was used to inhibit the expression of SEC61G and EdU to observe its effect on the proliferation of CC cell SiHa. The effect of SEC61G on invasion was evaluated by Transwell assay. TCGA database was used to analyze the influence of high or low SEC61G expression level on the overall survival of CC patients. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of SEC61G, p-RAF1, Raf1, p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in cells. SiHa cells overexpressing SEC61G (SiHa-SEC61G) and control group (SiHa-mock) were subcutaneously implanted in nude mice. The tumor growth curve was measured at the specified time points between SiHa-SEC61G and SiHa-mock. The inhibitory effect of gefitinib on SEC61G was further evaluated. In patients with CC, high SEC61G expression predicted poor prognosis. Silencing SEC61G inhibited proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro. Overexpression of SEC61G can promote the proliferation and invasion of CC cells in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of SEC61G promoted the proliferation of CC xenografts. Knocking down SEC61G can inhibit MAPK signaling pathway. Gefitinib can inhibit CC proliferation and tumor growth by SEC61G. SEC61G is highly expressed in CC and has poor prognosis. Inhibition of SEC61G expression can effectively inhibit the growth and proliferation of human CC cells. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway.	0.0		RAF1	gefitinib
70	70	Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC. We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending ≥ 6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (≥ 1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225. Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·4-12·3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5·2 months (4·5-5·8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·25-0·54; p < 0·0001). Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22%]), anaemia (one [1%] vs three [4%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2%] vs 0). Five (6%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20%) on chemotherapy. One patient in the erlotinib group and two in the standard chemotherapy group died from treatment-related causes. Our findings strengthen the rationale for routine baseline tissue-based assessment of EGFR mutations in patients with NSCLC and for treatment of mutation-positive patients with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

71	71	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)-dependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well.	1.0		EGFR	erlotinib
74	74	Activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (<i>EGFR</i>) are a driving force for some lung adenocarcinomas. Several randomized phase III studies have revealed that treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) results in an improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard chemotherapy in chemonaive patients with advanced non⁻small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), selected based on the presence of <i>EGFR</i> mutations. Patients treated with second-generation EGFR-TKIs have also shown an improved PFS relative to those treated with first-generation EGRF-TKIs. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI that still irreversibly inhibits the activity of EGFR after it has acquired the secondary T790M mutation that confers resistance to first- and second-generation drugs. Its efficacy has been validated for patients whose tumors have developed T790M-mediated resistance, as well as for first-line treatment of those patients with <i>EGFR</i> mutation⁻positive NSCLC. Although there are five EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib) currently available for the treatment of <i>EGFR</i>-mutated lung cancer, the optimal sequence for administration of these drugs remains to be determined. In this review, we addressed this issue with regard to maximizing the duration of the EGFR-TKI treatment.	1.0		EGFR	erlotinib
76	76	The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is believed to involve an altered balance between effector and regulatory T cells. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the toxicity of dioxins, controls T-cell responses. We investigated the role of AhR in inflammation and pathogenesis of IBD in humans and mouse models. AhR expression was evaluated in intestinal tissue samples from patients with IBD and controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were activated in the presence or absence of the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (Ficz). Colitis was induced in mice using trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), or T-cell transfer. Mice were given injections of Ficz or the AhR antagonist 2-metyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid; some mice first received injections of a blocking antibody against interleukin (IL)-22. Cytokines were quantified by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Intestine tissue from patients with IBD expressed significantly less AhR than controls. In LPMCs from patients with IBD, incubation with Ficz reduced levels of interferon gamma (IFN)-γ and up-regulated IL-22. Mice injected with Ficz were protected against TNBS-, DSS-, and T-cell transfer-induced colitis; they had marked down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and induction of IL-22. Mice given AhR antagonist produced more inflammatory cytokines and less IL-22 and developed a severe colitis. Neutralization of endogenous IL-22 disrupted the protective effect of Ficz on TNBS-induced colitis. AhR is down-regulated in intestinal tissue of patients with IBD; AhR signaling, via IL-22, inhibits inflammation and colitis in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. AhR-related compounds might be developed to treat patients with IBDs.	1.0		AHR	6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole
77	77	We had previously reported that treatment with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist β-naphthoflavone (βNF) suppressed mammosphere formation derived from cancer stem cells in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Cancer Lett., 317, 2012, Zhao et al.). Here, using several AHR agonists, we have investigated the association of this suppression with the classical ability to induce AHR-mediated gene transcription in the xenobiotic response element (XRE). The mammosphere formation assays were performed using wild-type and AHR-knockout MCF-7 cells in the presence of AHR agonists including 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), indirubin, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and kynurenine (KYN), followed by the XRE-reporter gene assays of the agonists. We showed that treatments with 3MC, BaP, and DMBA strongly suppressed mammosphere formation of the stem cells in an AHR-dependent manner, while other agonists showed weaker suppression. In reporter gene assays, the strength or duration of AHR/XRE-mediated gene transcription was found to be dependent on the agonist. Although strong transcriptional activation was observed with 3MC, FICZ, indirubin, I3C, IAA, or KYN after 6 h of treatment, only weak activation was seen with BaP or DMBA. While transcriptional activation was sustained or increased at 24 h with 3MC, BaP, or DMBA, appreciable reduction was observed with the other agonists. In conclusions, the results demonstrated that the suppressive effects of AHR agonists on mammosphere formation do not necessarily correlate with their abilities to induce AHR-mediated gene transcription. Hence, different AHR functions may be differentially induced in an agonist-dependent manner.	1.0		AHR	6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole
79	79	Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent, debilitating skin disease of the hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep-seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillae, inguinal and anogenital regions. The pathophysiology of the disease remains elusive, with newer therapies targeting various aspects of the dysregulated immune system. This presents a useful opportunity to look at the cytokine profile in HS and other inflammatory conditions that share similar patterns with the aim of teasing out less considered explanations for HS pathogenesis. It has been observed that IL-17 appears to be the most common denominator linking HS with other immune mediated diseases like Crohn, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Given that IL-17 plays an important role in antifungal immunity, evidenced by the cytokine pattern in fungal disease and the bulk of data citing their potential involvement in Crohn, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis; it is fair to suggest the need to explore the role that fungi play in the setting of HS going forward. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) is a ubiquitous and largely conserved entity that is gaining interest in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. It is well known to modulate autoimmune states. Its activation by both exogenous and endogenous agents result in secretion of IL-17 by Th17 cells. One of such agents is the tryptophan metabolite 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ)-which can be produced by microorganisms such as fungi. It will be interesting to explore its usefulness in HS pathogenesis.	1.0		AHR	6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole
80	80	B cell activating factor from the TNF family (BAFF) is implicated in not only the physiology of normal B cells, but also the pathophysiology of aggressive B cells related to malignant and autoimmune diseases. Autophagy plays a crucial role in balancing the beneficial and detrimental effects of immunity and inflammation. However, little is known about whether and how excessive BAFF mediates autophagy contributing to B-cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that excessive human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF) inhibited autophagy with a concomitant reduction of LC3-II in normal and B-lymphoid (Raji) cells. Knockdown of LC3 not only potentiated hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy, but also attenuated hsBAFF activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby diminishing hsBAFF-induced B-cell proliferation/viability. Further, we found that hsBAFF inhibition of autophagy was Akt/mTOR-dependent. This is supported by the findings that hsBAFF increased mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 (Ser757); Akt inhibitor X, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242, expression of dominant negative Akt, or knockdown of mTOR attenuated hsBAFF-induced phosphorylation of ULK1, decrease of LC3-II level, and increase of cell proliferation/viability. Chelating intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) with BAPTA/AM or preventing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation using EGTA or 2-APB profoundly blocked hsBAFF-induced activation of Akt/mTOR, phosphorylation of ULK1 and decrease of LC3-II, as well as increase of cell proliferation/viability. Similar effects were observed in the cells where CaMKII was inhibited by KN93 or knocked down by CaMKII shRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that hsBAFF inhibits autophagy promoting cell proliferation and survival through activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII-dependent Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level or CaMKII, Akt, or mTOR activity to promote autophagy may be exploited for prevention of excessive BAFF-induced aggressive B lymphocyte disorders and autoimmune diseases.	0.0		ULK1	pp242
81	81	mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 target--ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin, pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, short-term pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria, which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles (mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death. Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell--survival or cell death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy.	1.0		ULK1	pp242
84	84	Obesity is a primary factor provoking various chronic disorders, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and causes the death of 2.8 million individuals each year. Diet, physical activity, medications, and surgery are the main therapies for overweightness and obesity. During weight loss therapy, a decrease in energy stores activates appetite signaling pathways under the regulation of neuropeptides, including anorexigenic [corticotropin-releasing hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cholecystokinin (CCK), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript] and orexigenic [agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and melanin-concentrating hormone] neuropeptides, which increase food intake and lead to failure in attaining weight loss goals. Ginseng and ginsenosides reverse these signaling pathways by suppressing orexigenic neuropeptides (NPY and AgRP) and provoking anorexigenic neuropeptides (CCK and POMC), which prevent the increase in food intake. Moreover, the results of network pharmacology analysis have revealed that constituents of ginseng radix, including campesterol, beta-elemene, ginsenoside Rb1, biotin, and pantothenic acid, are highly correlated with neuropeptide genes that regulate energy balance and food intake, including <i>ADIPOQ</i>, <i>NAMPT</i>, <i>UBL5</i>, <i>NUCB2</i>, <i>LEP</i>, <i>CCK</i>, <i>GAST</i>, <i>IGF1</i>, <i>RLN1</i>, <i>PENK</i>, <i>PDYN</i>, and <i>POMC</i>. Based on previous studies and network pharmacology analysis data, ginseng and its compounds may be a potent source for obesity treatment by regulating neuropeptides associated with appetite.	1.0		NAMPT	ginsenoside rb1
90	90	This study aimed to explore the effect of GANT61 on regulating cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and cell cycle, and to investigate whether GANT61 would function in multiple myeloma (MM) via inhibiting Notch pathway. <b>Methods</b> RPMI-8226 and U266 cells were treated by GANT61 (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0 μmol/L) for 18, 24 and 36 hours (h), and cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit 8. Then these cells were treated by GANT61 at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 μmol/L for 24 h or treated by 10.0 μmol/L GANT61 for 0, 18, 24 and 36 h, and cell apoptosis rate, apoptosis markers and cell cycle were detected by AV/PI, Western blot, and PI staining. Notch1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Hes1 expressions were detected by qPCR and Western blot. Further rescue experiments were conducted by upregulating Notch1. <b>Results</b> In RPMI-8226 and U266 cells, GANT61 inhibited cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis rate and cell percentage of G1/G0 phase while decreased cell percentage of S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Besides, GANT61 inhibited Notch1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Hes1 expressions in a dose- and time-dependent manner as well. In rescue experiments, Notch1 upregulation attenuated the inhibition of cell proliferation, promotion of cell apoptosis, induction of G1/G0 cycle retardation and repression of Notch signaling pathway induced by GANT61 treatment in RPMI-8226 and U266 cells. <b>Conclusions</b> GANT61 suppresses cell proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis and induces G1/G0 cycle retardation with a dose- and time-dependent manner through inhibiting Notch pathway in MM.

92	92	To evaluate the incidence and determinants of diabetes in a cohort of HIV-infected adults initiated with combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) in 1997-1999 and followed up to 2009. Prospective study of 1046 patients at 47 French clinical sites. Potential determinants of diabetes occurrence, defined by confirmed increased glycemia and/or initiation of antidiabetic treatment, were assessed by a proportional hazards model, including time-updated metabolic parameters and ART exposure. Among the cohort, representing 7846 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 54% received indinavir, 75% stavudine and 52% didanosine. Overall, 111 patients developed diabetes, with an incidence of 14.1/1000 PYFU (14.6 in men, 12.6 in women). Incidence peaked in 1999-2000 (23.2/1000 PYFU) and decreased thereafter. The incidence of diabetes was associated [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), all P<0.02] with older age (hazard ratio = 2.13 when 40-49 years, hazard ratio = 3.63 when ≥50 years), overweight (hazard ratio = 1.91 for a BMI 25-29 kg/m(2), hazard ratio = 2.85 >30 kg/m(2)), waist-to-hip ratio (hazard ratio = 3.87 for ≥0.97 male/0.92 female), time-updated lipoatrophy (hazard ratio = 2.14) and short-term exposure to indinavir (0-1 year hazard ratio = 2.53), stavudine (0-1 year hazard ratio = 2.56, 1-2 years hazard ratio = 2.65) or didanosine (2-3 years hazard ratio = 3.16). Occurrence of diabetes was not associated with HIV-related markers, hepatitis C, hypertension or family history of diabetes. Insulin resistance was predictive for incident diabetes. In this nationwide cohort, followed for 10 years after cART initiation, diabetes incidence peaked in 1990-2000, was markedly higher than that reported for European uninfected or other HIV-infected populations (4-6/1000 PYFU) and linked with age and adiposity. Adiposity and glycemic markers should be monitored in aging HIV-infected patients.	0.0		AHR	stavudine
98	98	Increased expression of eicosanoids in cancer has been associated with adverse prognosis. We performed a randomized phase II trial to test the hypothesis that inhibitors of two eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], celecoxib and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX], zileuton) added to chemotherapy would improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC, a performance status of 0 to 2, and no prior therapy were eligible. All patients received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 mg/mL x min day 1 + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) days 1 and 8. Patients were randomly assigned to (a) zileuton 600 mg PO qid, (b) celecoxib 400 mg PO bid, or (c) celecoxib and zileuton at the same doses. Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and 5-LOX was performed without knowledge of outcomes. One hundred forty patients were entered and 134 were eligible and treated. There was no survival difference between the arms. COX-2 expression was a negative prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.51, P = .019 for index >or= 4; HR = 4.16, P = .005 for index = 9) for patients not receiving celecoxib. Patients with increased COX-2 expression (index >or= 4), receiving celecoxib had better survival than did COX-2-expressing patients not receiving drug (HR = .342, P = .005 for OS; HR = .294, P = .002 for failure-free survival). Multivariate analysis confirmed the interaction of COX-2 and celecoxib on survival. 5-LOX expression was neither prognostic nor predictive. This study failed to demonstrate the value of dual eicosanoid inhibition or benefit from either agent alone in addition to chemotherapy. However, a prospectively defined subset analysis suggests an advantage for celecoxib and chemotherapy for patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression.	1.0		LOX	zileuton
99	99	Inflammation plays a major role in the onset and progression of many diseases related to the respiratory system. Cysteinyl leukotrienes, the products of 5-LOX are a potent bronchoconstrictor. Vasicine, vasicinone and deoxyvasicine are the pyrroquinazoline alkaloids of <i>Adhatoda vasica</i> that are well known for their bronchodilatory activity. The current investigation evaluates the 5-LOX inhibitory potential of these alkaloids. Molecular docking results indicated that these alkaloids have similar binding energy as that of Zileuton, a commercial drug. Analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations, the binding free energy derived from MM-PBSA and interaction entropy indicated that vasicinone (-8.33 kcal/mol) exhibited a binding free energy comparable to that of Zileuton (-8.52 kcal/mol). The in-vitro results indicate the potential of vasicinone as a competitive inhibitor, while the in-silico results highlighted the potential of vasicine and deoxyvasicine as allosteric inhibitors. A possible mechanism behind the activity exhibited by the plant was also determined, which emphasized the potential of these alkaloids as leads for the design of novel 5-LOX inhibitors.	1.0		LOX	zileuton
100	100	New pyrazolone derivatives structurally related to celecoxib and FPL 62064 were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenases (COXs) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and their selectivity indices were calculated. The results showed that compounds 3f, 3h, 3l, and 3p have an excellent COX-2 selectivity index. Moreover, they showed potent 5-LOX inhibitory activity relative to celecoxib and zileuton, as positive controls. These promising candidates were further investigated for anti-inflammatory activity using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema method and ulcerogenic liability. The results showed no ulceration, which implies their gastric safety profile. Moreover, these compounds were evaluated for prostaglandin (PGE2) production in rat serum. Molecular docking in the COX-2 and 5-LOX active sites was performed to rationalize their anti-inflammatory activities. Strong binding interactions and effective docking scores were identified. The results indicated that these derivatives are good leads for dual-acting COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors to be used as potent and safe anti-inflammatory agents.	1.0		LOX	zileuton
101	101	Regeneration is the unmatched liver ability for recovering its functional mass after tissue lost. Leukotrienes (LT) are a family of eicosanoids with the capacity of signaling to promote proliferation. We analyzed the impact of blocking LT synthesis during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Male Wistar rats were subjected to two-third PH and treated with zileuton, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Our first find was a significant increment of intrahepatic LTB4 during the first hour after PH together with an increase in 5-LOX expression. Zileuton reduced hepatic LTB4 levels at the moment of hepatectomy and also inhibited the increase in hepatic LTB4. This inhibition produced a delay in liver proliferation as seen by decreased PCNA and cyclin D1 nuclear expression 24 h post-PH. Results also showed that hepatic LTB4 diminution by zileuton was associated with a decrease in NF-ĸB activity. Additionally, decreased hepatic LTB4 levels by zileuton affected the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) from zileuton-treated PH-rats displayed higher apoptosis than NPCs from PH control rats. In conclusion, the present work provides evidences that 5-LOX activation and its product LTB4 are involved in the initial signaling events for liver regeneration after PH and the pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme can delay the initial time course of the phenomenon.	1.0		LOX	zileuton
102	102	The gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, is a target for the development of therapeutic agents to address type 2 diabetes and obesity. Signal transduction processes mediated by GPCR activation typically result in receptor phosphorylation, but very little is known about GIPR phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for detecting phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of proteins and for identifying modification sites. However, applying MS methods to GPCRs is challenging because the native expression levels are low and the hydrophobicity of these proteins complicates isolation and enrichment. Here we use a widely available technique, trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOF MS), to characterize the phosphorylation status of the GIPR. We identified eight serine residues that are phosphorylated, one in an intracellular loop and the remainder in the C-terminal domain. Stimulation with the native agonist GIP enhanced phosphorylation at four of these sites. For comparison, we evaluated tirzepatide (TZP), a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the GIPR that has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Stimulation with TZP enhanced phosphorylation at the same four sites that were enhanced with GIP; however, TZP also enhanced phosphorylation at a fifth site that is unique to this synthetic agonist. This work establishes an important and accessible tool for the characterization of signal transduction via the GIPR and reveals an unanticipated functional difference between GIP and TZP.	1.0		GIPR	tirzepatide
103	103	The emergence of GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonists has heralded a renaissance of anti-obesity medication. In the recent SURMOUNT 2 trial, Garvey and colleagues set out to examine the weight loss efficacy of the GIPR:GLP-1R co-agonist tirzepatide in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, reporting that tirzepatide has unprecedented efficacy in a magnitude historically considered almost unattainable.<sup>1</sup>.	1.0		GIPR	tirzepatide
105	105	The incretin system is an essential metabolic axis that regulates postprandial metabolism. The two incretin peptides that enable this effect are the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which have cognate receptors (GIPR and GLP-1R) on islet β cells as well as in other tissues. Pharmacologic engagement of the GLP-1R is a proven strategy for treating hyperglycemia in diabetes and reducing body weight. Tirzepatide is the first monomeric peptide with dual activity at both incretin receptors now available for clinical use, and in clinical trials it has shown unprecedented effects to reduce blood glucose and body weight. Here, we discuss the foundational science that led to the development of monomeric multi-incretin receptor agonists, culminating in the development of tirzepatide. We also look to the future of this field and comment on how the concept of multi-receptor agonists will continue to progress for the treatment of metabolic disease.	1.0		GIPR	tirzepatide
107	107	Assay of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity plays an important role in diagnostic, detection of pesticides and nerve agents, in vitro characterization of toxins and drugs including potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease. These experiments were done in order to determine whether indoxylacetate could be an adequate chromogenic reactant for AChE assay evaluation. Moreover, the results were compared to the standard Ellman's method. We calculated Michaelis constant Km (2.06 × 10(-4) mol/L for acetylthiocholine and 3.21 × 10(-3) mol/L for indoxylacetate) maximum reaction velocity V(max) (4.97 × 10(-7) kat for acetylcholine and 7.71 × 10(-8) kat for indoxylacetate) for electric eel AChE. In a second part, inhibition values were plotted for paraoxon, and reactivation efficacy was measured for some standard oxime reactivators obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM) and HI-6. Though indoxylacetate is split with lower turnover rate, this compound appears as a very attractive reactant since it does not show any chemical reactivity with oxime antidots and thiol used for the Ellman's method. Thus it can be advantageously used for accurate measurement of AChE activity. Suitability of assay for butyrylcholinesterase activity assessment is also discussed.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam
108	108	Heptylphysostigmine (HPTL), a derivative of the AChE inhibitor physostigmine (PHY), is under investigation as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease. HPTL is active against human RBC AChE both in vitro and in vivo. Activity of HPTL against human brain has not been documented. We have developed an in vitro assay system using particulate membrane fractions which permits comparison of inhibition and recovery kinetics of human RBC (primarily globular dimer) and brain (primarily globular tetramer) membrane-bound forms. Under these conditions the HPTLIC50 is similar for the two forms. RBC AChE inhibition spontaneously reverses in 24 h, as occurs in vivo. In striking contrast, activity of inhibited brain enzyme does not recover on overnight incubation. DDVP-induced inhibition, but not HPTL inhibition, can be reversed by the oxime 2-PAM. Some recovery of HPTL inhibition, but not to the level seen with RBC AChE, occurs on addition of heat-stable fractions from serum or CSF. Brain enzyme recovers rapidly from PHY in this system. Responses of brain and RBC AChE to HPTL indicate that these forms are functionally as well as structurally distinct. Since brain inhibition apparently does not spontaneously reverse like RBC inhibition, peripheral measurements of patient responses should be assessed with caution during treatment with HPTL.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam
109	109	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme responsible for metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and inhibition of AChE can have therapeutic applications (e.g., drugs for Alzheimer's disease) or neurotoxic consequences (e.g., pesticides). A common absorbance-based AChE activity assay that uses 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) can have limited sensitivity and be prone to interference. Therefore, an alternative assay was developed, in which AChE activity was determined by measuring fluorescence of resorufin produced from coupled enzyme reactions involving acetylcholine and Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine). The Amplex Red assay was used for two separate applications. First, AChE activity was measured in rat whole blood, which is a biomarker for exposure to AChE inhibitor pesticides. Activity was quantified from a 10(5)-fold dilution of whole blood, and there was a linear correlation between Amplex Red and DTNB assays. For the second application, Amplex Red assay was used to measure AChE inhibition potency in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), which is important for assessing pharmacological and toxicological potential of AChE inhibitors including drugs, phytochemicals, and pesticides. Five known reversible inhibitors were evaluated (IC50, 7-225 nM), along with irreversible inhibitors chlorpyrifos-oxon (ki=1.01 nM(-1)h(-1)) and paraoxon (ki=0.16 nM(-1)h(-1)). Lastly, in addition to inhibition, AChE reactivation was measured in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM). The Amplex Red assay is a sensitive, specific, and reliable fluorescence method for measuring AChE activity in both rat whole blood and cultured SH-SY5Y cells.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam
110	110	Activated microglia is considered to be involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of amyloid-β(1-40) (Aβ(40) and exogenous agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 (Pam(3)CSK(4)) and TLR4 (LPS) on neurons in primary murine neuron-microglia co-cultures. Neuronal viability, assessed by quantifying the number of intact neuronal extensions and their crossings using a newly developed Definiens Cognition Network Technology-based method, was significantly decreased after treatment with Pam(3)CSK(4), LPS, and Aβ(40). Combined treatment with Aβ(40) and Pam(3)CSK(4) or LPS had an additive effect. Hence, in patients with AD, synergistic microglial activation by Aβ and bacterial products during infections might contribute to disease progression.	0.0	Alzheimer’s		2 pam
112	112	Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
113	113	The increased production of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease is acknowledged to be a key pathogenic event. In this study, we examined the response of primary human and rat brain cortical cultures to Abeta administration and found a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation content of numerous neuronal proteins, including tau and putative microtubule-associated protein 2c (MAP2c). We also found that paired helical filaments of aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau are tyrosine phosphorylated, indicating that changes in the phosphotyrosine content of cytoplasmic proteins in response to Abeta are potentially an important process. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and other neuronal proteins was specific to fibrillar Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(1-42). The tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by addition of the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7(t-butyl)pyrazol(3,4-d)pyramide (PP2) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Tyrosine phosphorylation of tau and MAP2c was concomitant with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent putative activation of the non-receptor kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Immunoprecipitation of Fyn, a member of the Src family, from Abeta(25-35)-treated neurons showed an increased association of Fyn with FAK. Abeta treatment of cells also stimulated the sustained activation of extracellular regulated kinase-2, which was blocked by addition of PP2 and LY 294002, suggesting that FAK/Fyn/PI3-kinase association is upstream of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in Abeta-treated neurons. This cascade of signaling events contains the earliest biochemical changes in neurons to be described in response to Abeta exposure and may be critical for subsequent neurodegenerative changes.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
115	115	The activity of Ras, a small GTPase protein, is increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> on the activation of Ras, and the involvement of the Ras hyperactivity in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced deficits in spatial cognition and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in mice (Aβ-mice) enhanced hippocampal Ras activation and expression, while 60 min incubation of hippocampal slices in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ-slices) only elevated Ras activity. Aβ-mice showed deficits in spatial cognition and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, but basal synaptic transmission was enhanced. The above effects of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> were corrected by the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS). ERK2 phosphorylation increased, and Src phosphorylation decreased in Aβ-mice and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices. Both were corrected by FTS. In CA1 pyramidal cells of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, the response of AMPA receptor and phosphorylation of GluR1 were enhanced with dependence on Ras activation rather than ERK signaling. In contrast, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function and GluN2A/2B phosphorylation were downregulated in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, which was recovered by application of FTS or the Src activator ouabain, and mimicked in control slices treated with the Src inhibitor PP2. The administration of PP2 impaired the spatial cognition and LTP induction in control mice and FTS-treated Aβ-mice. The treatment of Aβ-mice with ouabain rescued Aβ-impaired spatial cognition and LTP. Overall, the results indicate that the oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> hyperactivates Ras and thereby causes the downregulation of Src which impedes NMDAR-dependent LTP induction resulting in cognitive deficits.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
116	116	Although amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the mechanisms of Aβ neurotoxicity remain to be clarified. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Aβ on postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) tyrosine phosphorylation. Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying it may be a promising therapy in AD. Aβ25-35 oligomers (20 μg/rat) were administered intracerebroventricularly in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot was applied for measuring the protein levels of PSD-95 and β-actin. Following 3, 7, 14, 21 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 increased significantly, and peaked at 3 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment in hippocampal CA1 subfield. Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SrcPTKs) specific inhibitor PP2 attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 induced by Aβ25-35. Amantadine [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor noncompetitive antagonist], NVP-AAM077 (GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) and Ro25-6981 (GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) also suppressed the Aβ25-35-induced PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that Aβ oligomers induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs, which is mediated by the activation of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
118	118	The aim of this study is to determine whether renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASBs), which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-2 receptor 1 blockers (ARBs), improve the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The medical charts of 117 patients with metastatic NSCLC were retrospectively assessed. Thirty-seven patients (RASB group) using RASBs during systemic treatment were compared with 80 controls (control group) who did not use RASBs following the diagnosis of NSCLC. The histological tumor subtype, performance status, age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, other medications, chemotherapeutics (CT), and erlotinib that were received in any line of treatment were recorded. We compared the OS of the patients in the RASB and control groups.The median (±SD) age of the patients was 61 (±1) years and all patients were administered systemic treatment (CT or erlotinib). The patients in RASB group were more likely to be smokers, have hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and use erlotinib, thiazides, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers (P < 0.05 for all) compared with the control group. The median follow-up time was 18.9 months (range 1-102 months) for the entire group. The median follow-up period was longer for RASB group than control group (17 vs 11 months, P = 0.033). The most commonly prescribed RASB agent was valsartan (n = 12/37). At the time of the analysis, 98 (83.7%) of all patients had died. In the univariate analysis, the median OS was longer in the RASB group compared with the control group (17 [±4.1] vs 12 [±1.4] months, P = 0.016). Interestingly, further analyses revealed that RASBs significantly improved OS only if used with erlotinib concurrently (34 [±13.8] vs 25 [±5] months, P = 0.002) and the OS benefit was more attributable to ARBs because only 4 patients received ACEI and erlotinib concurrently. However, the benefit of ARBs on OS disappeared in the multivariate analysis.The use of ARBs during erlotinib treatment may prolong OS of patients with metastatic NSCLC.	0.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
119	119	Cardiac toxicity, manifested as diminished contractility, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure is a major issue in drug safety. Concerns revolve around targeted drugs (TKIs) where contractility effects were not anticipated. The ability to predict cardiac toxicity early would help to de-risk drugs in development and prepare physicians to manage risk in the clinic. Issues with current preclinical studies include insufficient testing with informative, translatable models, and predictive biomarkers. The isolated heart model is amenable to multiple assessments which can be combined with current technologies to assess toxicity on a multi-scale level. Rat isolated heart model was used to assess changes in left ventricular (LV) contractility and protein biomarkers BNP, IL6, TNFα, and cardiac troponins T (TnT) and I (TnI). Responses were assessed during perfusion with modified Henseleit Krebs (MHK), and 20 min concentration escalations of verapamil, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), isoproterenol, or 20 min escalations bracketing clinical blood concentrations of sunitinib, sorafenib, and erlotinib. LV parameters and effluent for biomarkers were collected before and during escalating drug concentrations. Verapamil reduced inotropy with no change in biomarkers, FCCP and isoproterenol reduced and increased heart function respectively and increased TnT and TNFα. Erlotinib had no significant effects on function or biomarkers. Sunitinib diminished function, increased TNFα at 0.1 μM, and increased TnT at higher concentrations. Sorafenib dose dependently increased TNFα beginning at 0.1 μM, reducing contractility and flow rate at 0.6 μM. The ex-vivo assay is a sensitive and predictive model for assessing changes in heart function and biomarkers of toxicity and injury. This assay demonstrates the potential for sunitinib and sorafenib to cause cardiac toxicity in humans. Also, TNFα appears to be a biomarker in the heart prior to injury. Due to its versatility, the isolated heart assay has potential to fill gaps in cardiac safety testing early in drug development.	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
121	121	Long eyelashes have been popularized and many commercially available products exist to achieve eyelash growth as a desired cosmetic effect. Eyelash trichomegaly may be induced by medications, procedures, or be related to medical conditions; however, the exact mechanisms that govern eyelash growth are not well elucidated. This study aims to identify and summarize aetiologies associated with eyelash trichomegaly. We report a systematic review of 148 clinical trials, prospective and retrospective studies, and case reports describing all evidence-based potential aetiologies of eyelash trichomegaly obtained from the Medline/PubMed and Cochrane Library through January 2021. Inclusion criteria were defined as (i) human studies involving congenital and acquired diseases in which eyelash trichomegaly is a characteristic or (ii) assessment of trichomegaly as an adverse or desired effect of a medication or procedure. Exclusion criteria included animal studies, articles not available in English, outcomes unrelated to eyelash trichomegaly, and secondary review articles. Pharmacologic agents associated with eyelash trichomegaly included prostaglandin analogues (15-keto fluprostenol isopropyl ester, bimatoprost, latanoprost, and travoprost), epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib, and panitumumab), interferon-alpha, and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine). Surgical procedures of the eyelid, as well as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, HIV, ichthyosis vulgaris (IV), uveitis, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis were also associated with increased eyelash growth. Congenital disorders associated with lengthened eyelashes included Cantú syndrome, CHOPS syndrome, Coffin-Siris syndrome, congenital heart disease, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Costello syndrome, familial trichomegaly, Floating Harbor syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Kabuki-Makeup syndrome, KBG syndrome, Oliver-McFarlane syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. While the most common cause of eyelash trichomegaly is topical bimatoprost use, better understanding of pathways implicated in eyelash trichomegaly may lead to the discovery of additional medications to stimulate eyelash growth and create avenues for future therapeutic interventions.	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
125	125	Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Aidi injection (ADI) is a representative antitumor medication based on Chinese herbal injection, but its antitumor mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, the subcutaneous xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was established in nude mice to investigate the anticancer effect of ADI in vivo. We then determined the components of ADI using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and explored the possible molecular mechanisms against pancreatic cancer using network pharmacology. In vivo experiments, the volume, weight, and degree of histological abnormalities of implanted tumors were significantly lower in the medium and high concentration ADI injection groups than in the control group. Network pharmacology analysis identified four active components of ADI and seven key targets, TNF, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, MAPK14, CASP3, P53 and JUN. Molecular docking also revealed high affinity between the active components and the target proteins, including Astragaloside IV to P53 and VEGFA, Ginsenoside Rb1 to CASP3 and Formononetin to JUN. ADI could reduce the growth rate of tumor tissue and alleviate the structural abnormalities in tumor tissue. ADI is predicted to act on VEGFA, P53, CASP3, and JUN in ADI-mediated treatment of pancreatic cancer.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		ginsenoside rb1
127	127	Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the most widely characterized of the three vertebrate Hedgehog homologs, and is essential for proper embryonic development. Shh binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptch1), resulting in the de-repression of Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the activation of Gli2, which regulates the transcription of target genes that include Gli1 and Ptch1. Several synthetic and naturally occurring small-molecule modulators of Smo have been discovered. Shh-signaling antagonists that bind to Smo include cyclopamine, SANT1, and Cur-61414. Shh signaling agonists that bind to Smo include the synthetic small molecules purmorphamine and SAG. Small molecules that inhibit Shh signaling downstream of Smo, GANT58 and GANT61 have also been reported. Robotnikinin inhibits the Shh pathway by directly targeting Shh. Although progress has been made in understanding and modulating Shh signaling, fundamental aspects of Shh signal transduction remain obscure, including the mechanism(s) whereby Ptch1 regulates Smo activity. Small-molecule modulators of Shh signaling provide a means to regulate the activity of a pathway implicated in medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and developmental disorders. Several Shh inhibitors have not succeeded in the clinic for unknown reasons, but clinical trials in BCC and pancreatic cancer with the promising Smo antagonists GDC-0449 and IPI-926 are currently underway.	0.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
129	129	The HH signaling pathway is a 'core' signal transduction pathway in pancreatic cancer that promotes the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancers via enhancing cell proliferation, increasing invasion and metastasis and protecting against apoptosis. In the present study, we found that HH signaling regulates autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells. Activation of HH signaling inhibits autophagy, while inhibition of the HH pathway induces autophagy. Although the role of autophagy in cell survival and apoptosis may depend on tumor type and the microenvironment, our data clearly demonstrated that GANT61-induced autophagy contributed to reduced viability and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro, and these effects were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA. We propose that HH signaling by regulating autophagy plays an important role in determining the cellular response to HH-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer and further investigation of the interaction between autophagy and HH signaling is particularly important.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
130	130	Hedgehog signals are transduced through Patched receptors to the Smoothened (SMO)-SUFU-GLI and SMO-Gi-RhoA signaling cascades. MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as <i>BCL2, FOXA2, FOXE1, FOXF1, FOXL1, FOXM1, GLI1, HHIP, PTCH1</i> and <i>WNT2B</i>, in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis, immune evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired <i>SMO</i> mutations, <i>SUFU</i> deletions, <i>GLI2</i> amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/β-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione B and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
132	132	The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of diabetes among HIV-infected patients in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) cohort, to identify demographic, HIV-related, and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-related factors associated with the onset of diabetes, and to identify possible mechanisms for any relationships found. D:A:D is a prospective observational study of 33,389 HIV-infected patients; diabetes is a study end point. Poisson regression models were used to assess the relation between diabetes and exposure to cART after adjusting for known risk factors for diabetes, CD4 count, lipids, and lipodystrophy. Over 130,151 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), diabetes was diagnosed in 744 patients (incidence rate of 5.72 per 1,000 PYFU [95% CI 5.31-6.13]). The incidence of diabetes increased with cumulative exposure to cART, an association that remained significant after adjustment for potential risk factors for diabetes. The strongest relationship with diabetes was exposure to stavudine; exposures to zidovudine and didanosine were also associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Time-updated measurements of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were all associated with diabetes. Adjusting for each of these variables separately reduced the relationship between cART and diabetes slightly. Although lipodystrophy was significantly associated with diabetes, adjustment for this did not modify the relationship between cART and diabetes. Stavudine and zidovudine are significantly associated with diabetes after adjustment for risk factors for diabetes and lipids. Adjustment for lipodystrophy did not modify the relationship, suggesting that the two thymidine analogs probably directly contribute to insulin resistance, potentially through mitochondrial toxicity.	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
133	133	Lipodystrophy is common in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs), stavudine, and zidovudine. Adipocytokines may be altered in lipodystrophy. We evaluated risk factors, adipocytokine levels, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles in HIV-infected adolescents with different lipodystrophy types. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 80 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents receiving PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy for ≥ 6 months. Patients underwent oral glucose tolerance tests and measurements of high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, resistin, insulin, and lipids. They were classified into 3 groups based on the clinical findings no lipodystrophy, isolated lipoatrophy, and any lipohypertrophy (isolated lipohypertrophy or combined type). Of the 80 patients (median age, 16.7 years), 18 (22.5%) had isolated lipoatrophy, while 8 (10%) had any lipohypertrophy (four with isolated lipohypertrophy, and four with the combined type). In a multivariate analysis, longer exposure to stavudine (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p = 0.005) and indinavir (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p = 0.012) were associated with lipoatrophy, while longer exposure to didanosine (OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.017) and indinavir (OR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21; p = 0.045) were associated with any lipohypertrophy. Leptin levels were highest in the any-lipohypertrophy group and lowest in the isolated-lipoatrophy group (p = 0.013). HMW adiponectin levels were significantly lowest in the any-lipohypertrophy group and highest in the no-lipodystrophy group (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in the levels of resistin among the three groups (p = 0.234). The prevalence of insulin resistance (p = 0.002) and prediabetes/diabetes (p < 0.001) were significantly highest in the any-lipohypertrophy group. Patients with lipoatrophy and those without lipodystrophy had comparable degrees of insulin resistance (p = 0.292). In multiple linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and waist-height ratio, HMW adiponectin levels were associated with Matsuda index (β = 0.5; p = 0.003) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (β = 40.1; p = 0.010) and almost significantly associated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.054). Leptin and resistin levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, Matsuda index, or QUICKI (all p > 0.05). Abnormal glucose metabolism and dysregulation of adipocytokines were common in the HIV-infected adolescents with lipohypertrophy and the combined type. Preventive screening for cardiovascular diseases caused by metabolic alterations should be routinely performed.	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
135	135	<b>Introduction</b> Efficient antiretroviral-treatment (ART) generally allows control of HIV infection. However, persons-living-with-HIV (PLWH), when aging, present a high prevalence of metabolic diseases. <b>Area covered</b> Altered adiposity, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, diabetes, and their consequences are prevalent in PLWH and could be partly related to ART. <b>Expert opinion</b> At first, personal and lifestyle factors are involved in the onset of these complications. The persistence of HIV in tissue reservoirs could synergize with some ART and enhance metabolic disorders. Altered fat repartition, diagnosed as lipodystrophy, has been related to first-generation nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors (NRTIs) (stavudine zidovudine) and some protease inhibitors (PIs). Recently, use of some integrase-inhibitors (INSTI) resulted in weight/fat gain, which represents a worrisome unresolved situation. Lipid parameters were affected by some first-generation NRTIs, non-NRTIs (efavirenz) but also PIs boosted by ritonavir, with increased total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Insulin resistance is common associated with abdominal obesity. Diabetes incidence, high with first-generation-ART (zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine, indinavir) has declined with contemporary ART close to that of the general population. Metabolic syndrome, a dysmetabolic situation with central obesity and insulin resistance, and liver steatosis are common in PLWH and could indirectly result from ART-associated fat gain and insulin resistance. All these dysmetabolic situations increase the atherogenic cardiovascular risk.	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
136	136	Diabetic individuals are more susceptible to infections and this seems to be related to impaired phagocyte function. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the first barrier to prevent respiratory infections. Leukotrienes (LTs) increase AM phagocytic activity via Fc gamma R. In this study, we compared AMs from diabetic and non-diabetic rats for phagocytosis via Fc gamma R and the roles of LTs and insulin. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by alloxan (42 mg/kg, i.v.); macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and IgG-opsonised sheep red blood cells (IgG-SRBC) were used as targets. LTs were added to the AMs 5 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC. AMs were treated with a LT synthesis inhibitor (zileuton, 10 microM), or antagonists of the LTB(4) receptor (CP105.696, 10 microM) or cys-LT receptor (MK571, 10 microM), 30 or 20 min before the addition of IgG-SRBC, respectively. We found that the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC by AMs from diabetic rats is impaired compared with non-diabetic rats. Treatment with the LT inhibitor/antagonists significantly reduced AM phagocytosis in non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. During the phagocytosis of IgG-SRBC LTB(4) and LTC(4) were produced by AMs from both groups. The addition of exogenous LTB(4) or LTD(4) potentiated phagocytosis similarly in both groups. Phagocytosis was followed by the phosphorylation of PKC-delta, ERK and Akt. This was reduced by zileuton treatment in AMs from non-diabetic but not diabetic rats. The addition of insulin to AMs further increased the phagocytosis by increasing PKC-delta phosphorylation. These results suggest that the impaired phagocytosis found in AMs from diabetic rats is related to a deficient coupling of LTs to the Fc gamma R signaling cascade and that insulin has a key role in this coupling. An essential role for insulin in innate immunity is suggested.	1.0	Diabetes		zileuton
140	140	Due to potential ethnic differences in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, new therapeutics need to be evaluated in Japanese patients. We aimed to assess the safety and glycaemic efficacy of tirzepatide as an add-on treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with stable doses of various oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapies. This multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial was conducted at 34 medical research centres and hospitals in Japan. Eligible participants were aged 20 years or older with inadequately controlled (HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥7·0% to <11·0%) type 2 diabetes and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy (sulfonylureas, biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinedione, glinides, or SGLT2 inhibitors) for at least 3 months (stable dose for ≥8 weeks before screening), had a BMI of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, and stable bodyweight (±5%) for at least 3 months before screening. After a 2-week screening and 2-week lead-in period, all participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 5, 10, or 15 mg of tirzepatide, administered once per week subcutaneously for 52 weeks followed by a 4 week safety follow-up period, using a computer-generated random sequence and interactive web response system, stratified by oral antihyperglycaemic medication group. All participants started receiving 2·5 mg tirzepatide and doses were escalated by 2·5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability during 52 weeks of treatment, assessed as incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861039. Between March 30, 2019, and Feb 16, 2021, with recruitment and enrolment continuing until Feb 4, 2020, 484 participants were assessed for eligibility and 443 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of tirzepatide (148 [33%] in the 5 mg group, 147 [33%] in the 10 mg group, and 148 [33%] in the 15 mg group). 398 (90%) participants completed the study and treatment. Most participants (343 [77%] of 443) had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent in the tirzepatide 15 mg group (125 [84%] of 148) than the 5 mg (109 [74%] of 148) and 10 mg groups (109 [74%] of 147). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events with tirzepatide were mild or moderate nasopharyngitis (75 [17%]), nausea (74 [17%]), constipation (54 [12%]), diarrhoea (51 [12%]), and decreased appetite (44 [10%]). At week 52, mean changes from baseline in bodyweight were -3·8 kg (SE 0·5; -5·1% reduction) in the 5 mg group, -7·5 kg (0·5; -10·1% reduction) in the 10 mg group, and -10·2 kg (0·5; -13·2% reduction) in the 15 mg group. Least squares mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline reduced from 8·5% (SE 0·1) to 6·0% (0·1) in the 5 mg tirzepatide group, from 8·6% (0·1) to 5·6% (0·1) in the 10 mg group, and from 8·6% (0·1) to 5·6% (0·1) in the 15 mg group at week 52. No adjudication-confirmed deaths were reported. Tirzepatide was well tolerated as an add-on to oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes and showed improvement in glycaemic control and bodyweight, irrespective of background oral antihyperglycaemic medication. Tirzepatide is a potential new treatment option for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with single oral antihyperglycaemic medication. Eli Lilly and Company.

141	141	Tirzepatide (Mounjaro™) is a single molecule that combines dual agonism of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors. Native GIP and GLP-1 are incretin hormones that stimulate insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion. GIP also plays a role in nutrient and energy metabolism, while GLP-1 also delays gastric emptying, supresses appetite and improves satiety. Eli Lilly is developing tirzepatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, cardiovascular disorders in T2DM, heart failure, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, obstructive sleep apnoea and for reducing mortality/morbidity in obesity. In May 2022, tirzepatide received its first approval in the USA to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM, as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Tirzepatide is in phase III development for heart failure, obesity and cardiovascular disorders in T2DM, and in phase II development for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of tirzepatide leading to this first approval for T2DM.	1.0	Diabetes		tirzepatide
