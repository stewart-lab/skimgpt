26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, which is a first-in-class agent to be approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, likely because of solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluations, with dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily being allowed for specific toxicities. Idelalisib may be administered without regard to food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant food effects, and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79 % increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Administration with the potent inducer rifampin resulted in a 75 % decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and, as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice-daily dosing increases the midazolam AUC 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no meaningful impact on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was noted for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60 % higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment; no relevant changes were observed with severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology programme, including drug-drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, which has allowed a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and their impact on clinical safety and efficacy.	Breast Cancer		Idelalisib	Understanding the potential application of Idelalisib in breast cancer would require data or studies that specifically address its impact on the pathogenic mechanisms or therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer models or patients. Without such information, one cannot conclusively evaluate its usefulness against breast cancer based on the provided text alone. The text is valuable for understanding Idelalisib's general pharmacological profile but not sufficient to assess its potential benefits in breast cancer therapy.	0
27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare ocular diseases, which are commonly associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate clinical and laboratory features of SLE-associated episcleritis and scleritis, we now report 4 cases of inpatients who were diagnosed with episcleritis or scleritis secondary to SLE from September 2005 to July 2016 in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology in Peking University People's Hospital. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarized together with the treatment regimen and the prognosis; the literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patients. The average age was (49.0±23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1±1.4) years. In addition to the eye involvement, the patients had mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis and interstitial pneumonia simultaneously; in the past, 1 patient experienced arthritis, 2 presented Raynaud's phenomenon, and 2 had hematologic involvement. All the patients had antinuclear antibody (ANA) of high titer. The anti double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were increased in 2 patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other 1 patient did not test it. The complement levels were decreased in 3 patients. The systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores were more than 4 points in all the patients (ranging from 7-16), suggesting active disease. Ocular symptoms included pain, redness of the eye and tears. Ophthalmic examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Among the 4 patients, 2 patients experienced ocular complications including decrease in vision and uveitis. All the patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with hydroxycloroquine; 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All of the 4 patients received topical steroid and 1 patient received periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide; 1 patient received topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during the follow-ups. As a conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including SLE. The occurrence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active disease of SLE. Ocular complications need to be aware of in the patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment was associated with good visual outcomes in the follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	While leflunomide is mentioned as part of the treatment regimen for one of the patients, the text does not delve into its effectiveness or mechanism of action specifically in the context of treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is noted as a condition experienced by some of the patients in the past, but there is no detailed analysis or discussion on whether leflunomide—or any other treatment mentioned—was directly aimed at alleviating or targeting the key pathogenic mechanisms of Raynaud's.    To evaluate whether leflunomide could be effective for Raynaud's, one would look for specific discussions on its impact on vascular function, endothelial health, or other relevant pathophysiological aspects of Raynaud's. Such details would provide insight into whether leflunomide could offer therapeutic benefits or slow disease progression for Raynaud's patients.    In conclusion, while the text is informative regarding the treatment of ocular manifestations in SLE patients and mentions leflunomide as part of a treatment regimen, it does not offer sufficient evidence or discussion to evaluate leflunomide's efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Further research or texts focusing specifically on Raynaud's and the use of leflunomide in that context would be necessary for such an evaluation.	0
21701167	Background: Prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been tested for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert their benefit via inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins.  Methods: Thirty patients with documented CAD and triglycerides over 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/daily) and statins (simvastatin equivalence dose: 5-40 mg/daily) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor™ 1 g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or a placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks following PO-3A therapy.  Results: ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), formation of platelet-monocyte microparticles (p = 0.19) and the VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) only exhibited nonsignificant trends suggestive of reduced platelet activity. Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, closure time with the PFA-100 device and expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40-ligand (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A.  Conclusion: Independently of the dose and already at 1 week, short-term therapy with PO-3A provided a modest reduction of platelet activity biomarkers, despite concomitant aspirin and statin therapy, when compared to a placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests potential pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data call for confirmation in prospective studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	The results indicate that short-term therapy with PO-3A leads to a modest reduction in certain markers of platelet activity, suggesting that these omega-3-acid ethyl esters have a unique effect on platelet function beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. The significant reductions observed in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, GP IIb/IIIa antigen and activity, and P-selectin after PO-3A therapy, compared to a placebo, highlight a potential mechanism through which PO-3A could offer benefits in the context of heart disease.    Platelets play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are central to the development and progression of CAD. By reducing platelet activation and aggregation, PO-3A might help to lower the risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction, thereby potentially slowing the progression of heart disease.    The text mentions that the effects observed call for confirmation in prospective studies, indicating that while the findings are promising, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential and implications of PO-3A in heart disease. Nonetheless, this study contributes valuable evidence to the discussion on the benefits of omega-3-acid ethyl esters in heart disease, especially regarding their unique antiplatelet properties and potential role in therapeutic strategies beyond conventional treatments.	1
12676734	This review outlines recent advances related to the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be interpreted by different cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, in both regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking events can also lead to AQP2 membrane accumulation via cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and l-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and by membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 recycles constitutively in epithelial cells, it can be inserted into different membrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and these pathways can be modulated by factors including hypertonicity. The roles of accessory proteins, including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion, are also being uncovered. Understanding cAMP-independent mechanisms for membrane insertion of AQP2 is especially relevant to the therapeutic bypassing of the mutated, dysfunctional vasopressin receptor in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.		AQP2	sodium	While sodium nitroprusside is mentioned, it serves as a nitric oxide donor rather than directly illustrating an interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression or trafficking. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence or discussion specifically related to sodium modulating AQP2 expression directly.    To evaluate the original question regarding sodium's interaction with AQP2 expression, one would look for research directly investigating the impact of sodium levels on AQP2 expression, trafficking, or function. This could include studies on how sodium concentration affects AQP2's cellular localization, stability, or activity, none of which are directly addressed in the given text.	0
29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30-40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.  Keywords: Glucose-lowering agents; Heart failure; Heart failure hospitalization; Heart failure treatment; Type 2 diabetes mellitus.		DPP4	metformin	To evaluate whether there exists an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4, information is needed on pharmacogenetic studies, biochemical interactions, or clinical trials that specifically investigate how metformin might influence DPP4 gene expression or enzyme functionality. Such information would involve detailed discussions on the mechanisms of action of metformin that could potentially impact the DPP4 pathway.  In conclusion, while the text is useful for understanding the broader clinical implications of using various diabetes treatments in heart failure patients, it does not address the specific query about an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4. For that, a different source or text focusing specifically on pharmacogenetic interactions or the molecular effects of metformin on DPP4 would be required.	0
38574433	Aims: Doxorubicin is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent for cancer, whose use is limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a novel analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has received widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.  Methods and results: Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggested that Bnip3 is the candidate gene that impaired the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter was injected into tail vein of C57/BL6J mice to overexpress BNIP3, specifically in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented the improvement in cardiac function caused by semaglutide. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide, via PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced BNIP3 expression in the mitochondria, improving mitochondrial function.  Conclusion: Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction via PI3K/AKT pathway, by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. The improvement in mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential therapy to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.  Keywords: BNIP3; Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; Mitochondria; PI3K/AKT; Semaglutide.		BNIP3	Semaglutide	The text provided is indeed useful for evaluating the interaction between the drug semaglutide and the gene BNIP3. It describes a study focused on the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, in ameliorating cardiotoxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Key findings include:  Evidence of Interaction: RNA sequencing identified BNIP3 as a candidate gene that may impair the protective effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This suggests a genetic interaction where BNIP3 expression potentially modifies the effectiveness of semaglutide in this context.  Experimental Verification: Further experiments involving overexpression of BNIP3 in mice showed that increased levels of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide from improving cardiac function, which indicates that BNIP3 expression is inversely related to the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide.  Mechanistic Insights: The text also mentions that semaglutide, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduces BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, which in turn improves mitochondrial function. This reduction in BNIP3 expression is directly linked to semaglutide's ability to mitigate mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction.  Therapeutic Implications: The conclusion that semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via a pathway that includes modulation of BNIP3 expression offers valuable insights into both the therapeutic mechanism of semaglutide and the role of BNIP3 in cardiac health.  Overall, the text clearly demonstrates that there is an interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene, with semaglutide modulating the expression of BNIP3 to exert its therapeutic effects. This interaction is relevant for understanding how semaglutide can be used to potentially mitigate cardiac injury in clinical settings involving doxorubicin treatment. The study details provided would be critical for any further research into the pharmacodynamics of semaglutide and its broader applications in cardiac therapeutics.	1
35455941	The GBA gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. Approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Clinically, GBA-associated PD is identical to sporadic PD, aside from the earlier age at onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment and more rapid progression. Mutations in GBA can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies, which are made up primarily of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the GBA gene may lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which may impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate dysfunction of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to aberrant lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Certain mutations cause GCase to be misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, a GCase deficiency has also been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with GBA-PD and highlights potential treatments which may act to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gene GBA. Here are several reasons supporting its usefulness:  Clear Connection Between GBA Mutations and PD: The text specifies that approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, establishing it as a significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. This direct association underlines the importance of the GBA gene in the context of PD.  Detailed Mechanistic Insights: The text describes how mutations in the GBA gene may lead to loss of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. This dysfunction is crucial as it impairs alpha-synuclein metabolism, a key process in the pathogenesis of PD. Alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of PD. This provides a mechanistic link between GBA mutations and the pathological features observed in PD.  Biological Consequences of GBA Mutations: The review further explains that GBA mutations can result in both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. It details how these mutations can cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. This expands on the ways in which GBA mutations can influence cellular health and PD pathology.  Association with Clinical Features of PD: It is mentioned that GBA-associated PD is clinically similar to sporadic PD but with distinct features like an earlier age at onset, more rapid progression, and more frequent cognitive impairment. This differentiation is critical for understanding the clinical impact of GBA mutations in PD patients.  Therapeutic Implications: The text highlights potential treatments targeting GCase to prevent neurodegeneration, which not only underscores the interaction between GBA and PD but also suggests practical applications of this knowledge in developing therapeutic strategies.	1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it features abnormal epidermal proliferation, infiltrating inflammatory cells and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  Objectives: To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis.  Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were evaluated with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model, as well as from cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination and degradation were examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and a cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein ECs. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, the Matrigel plug assay and quantification of vasculature in the mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelial-specific conditional KO mice were used.  Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-triggered PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination depended on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In the mouse model, Skp2 gene deficiency alleviated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelial-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly ameliorated psoriasis with diminished angiogenesis of papillae. Furthermore, topical use of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented the experimental psoriasis.  Conclusions: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach to treating psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease psoriasis and the gene SKP2. Here's an argument supporting its usefulness:  Direct Investigation of Skp2 in Psoriasis: The study's objectives clearly focus on examining the role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Skp2 is studied in both human and animal models, providing a comprehensive view of its function and effects in the context of this disease.  Increased Expression in Disease Context: The results show that Skp2 expression is increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis as well as in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis. This upregulation in disease contexts suggests a potential pathogenic role of Skp2 in psoriasis.  Link to Psoriasis-Associated Angiogenesis: Skp2 is associated with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae, indicating a specific role in the angiogenic aspect of psoriasis pathology. The text details how Skp2 overexpression enhances endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, which are key components of angiogenesis.  Mechanistic Insights Involving Skp2 and PTEN: The study identifies PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction leads to the degradation of PTEN, further implicating Skp2 in the molecular pathways that exacerbate psoriasis, particularly through the modulation of angiogenic processes.  Therapeutic Implications and Genetic Confirmation: Use of Skp2 inhibitors and genetic knockout models (both global and endothelial-specific) demonstrate that reducing Skp2 activity or expression can significantly ameliorate psoriasis symptoms and reduce disease-associated angiogenesis. These findings not only support the role of Skp2 in psoriasis but also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.  Broad Experimental Approaches: The combination of gene expression analysis, protein interaction studies, and functional assays in cell culture and in vivo, along with the use of both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models, provides a robust set of evidence linking Skp2 with psoriasis pathology.  In conclusion, the text is not only useful but also critical in providing detailed evidence of an interaction between psoriasis and the gene SKP2. It elucidates a specific biological pathway involving Skp2 that contributes to disease mechanisms, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The clear demonstration of increased Skp2 activity in psoriasis lesions and its role in promoting pathological angiogenesis via PTEN degradation underlines the importance of Skp2 as a molecular link in the progression of psoriasis.	1
38178103	Background: Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear.  Methods: Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.  Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors.  Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.  Keywords: Cytokines; Dementia; Gut microbiota; Mendelian randomization.	Dementia	IVW		The piece of text provided is not useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease dementia and the gene "IVW". Here are several points that clarify why the text does not serve this purpose:  Misinterpretation of "IVW": The text uses the term "IVW" in the context of statistical analysis, specifically referring to "Inverse Variance Weighting". IVW is a method used in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across multiple genetic instruments. It is not a gene, but rather a statistical technique.  Focus of the Study: The primary focus of the study is on the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia. The study aims to explore if cytokines mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and dementia, using genetic data from GWAS and MR.  No Mention of Gene IVW: There is no discussion or mention of a gene called "IVW" in the context of genetics or molecular biology within the text. Therefore, the text cannot be used to assess any interaction involving a gene named "IVW" and dementia because "IVW" in this context refers to a methodological approach, not a genetic entity.  Conclusion Misalignment: Since "IVW" refers to a method rather than a gene, the conclusions drawn from using this method (causal relationships between microbiota, cytokines, and dementia types) do not provide information about genetic interactions specific to a gene influencing dementia.  In summary, the text is useful for understanding the application of Mendelian randomization in exploring causal links between gut microbiota, cytokines, and dementia but it does not provide any insight into interactions between dementia and a gene called "IVW" simply because "IVW" is not a gene but a statistical method used in the analysis. Thus, the text cannot be used to evaluate genetic interactions involving a gene with that name in relation to dementia.	0
26242379	Idelalisib is a potent, selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor and the first drug approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased less than in a dose-proportional manner, possibly due to solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluation, with a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily permitted for certain toxicities. Idelalisib may be administered with or without food based on the lack of clinically relevant food effects and was therefore administered in the primary efficacy/safety study. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Co-administration of 400 mg of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, once daily resulted in an approximately 79% increase in idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Coadministration with the strong inducer rifampin decreases idelalisib exposure (AUC) by 75% and co-administration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed primarily through AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. Therefore, when 150 mg of idelalisib is administered twice a day, midazolam AUC increases by 5.4 times. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion transport polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, or OAPT1B3. In the population pharmacokinetic model, no significant effect on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was seen for any covariate tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60% higher for moderate/severe hepatic impairment. No relevant changes were observed in severe renal impairment. This article reviews our comprehensive pharmacology program, including drug-drug interaction studies, mechanisms, and special population studies. This will provide a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and its impact on clinical safety and efficacy.	Breast Cancer		Idelalisib	Understanding the potential application of Idelalisib in breast cancer requires data or studies that specifically address its impact on pathogenic mechanisms or therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer models or patients. Without this information, one cannot conclusively evaluate its benefit against breast cancer based on the text provided alone. The text is useful for understanding the general pharmacokinetic profile of Idelalisib but is not sufficient to evaluate its potential benefits in treating breast cancer.	0
27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare eye diseases that are commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of SLE-related episcleritis and scleritis, we enrolled 4 hospitalized patients diagnosed with SLE-related episcleritis or scleritis at the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, People's Hospital of Peking University from September 2005 to July 2016. We report one case. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were summarized along with treatment regimens and prognosis. The literature was reviewed. The patients were 3 women and 1 man. The mean age was 49.0 ± 23.8 years, and the mean duration of SLE at onset of episcleritis or scleritis was 2.1 ± 1.4 years. In addition to ocular involvement, the patients suffered concurrent mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis, and interstitial pneumonia. In the past, one patient experienced arthritis, two patients showed Raynaud's phenomenon, and two patients had hematological involvement. All patients had high titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Anti-double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were increased in two patients. Three patients had positive antinucleosomal antibodies (ANuA), and one other patient was not tested for these. Complement levels were decreased in three patients. In all patients (7 to 16 patients), the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score was 4 or higher, suggesting active disease. Eye symptoms include pain, redness of the eyes, and watery eyes. Ophthalmological examination revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Two of the four patients experienced ocular complications such as decreased vision and uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with hydroxychloroquine. Three patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in two patients and leflunomide in one patient). All four patients received topical steroids, and one patient received periocular injections of triamcinolone acetonide. One patient received topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and no recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during follow-up. In conclusion, although uncommon, scleritis and episcleritis may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including SLE. The development of episcleritis and scleritis may indicate active disease in SLE. Patients should be aware of ocular complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment were associated with good visual outcome at follow-up.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	While leflunomide is mentioned as part of a patient's treatment regimen, the text does not delve into its effectiveness or mechanism of action specifically in the context of treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon has been noted as a condition experienced by some patients in the past, but there is no detailed analysis or discussion of whether leflunomide - or any other treatment mentioned - is directly aimed at alleviating or targeting the major pathogenic mechanisms of Raynaud's disease. To evaluate whether leflunomide is effective in treating Raynaud's, one can look for specific discussions of its effect on vascular function, endothelial health, or other pathophysiological aspects relevant to Raynaud's. Such details will provide insight into whether leflunomide could offer therapeutic benefits or slow disease progression in Raynaud's patients. In conclusion, while the text is informative regarding the treatment of ocular manifestations in patients with SLE and mentions leflunomide as part of the treatment regimen, it does not provide sufficient evidence or discussion to evaluate the effectiveness of leflunomide in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon. Further research or texts focusing specifically on Raynaud's disease and the use of leflunomide in this context would be necessary to make such an evaluation.	0
21701167	Background: Prescribed omega-3 acid ethyl ester (PO-3A) has been tested for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias, and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert its benefits through platelet inhibition. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Methods: Thirty patients with CAD and triglycerides ≥250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/day) and statins (simvastatin equivalent dose: 5-40 mg/day) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor™ 1. It has been assigned. g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet testing, including agglutination, flow cytometry, and cartridge analyzer readings, was performed at baseline and at weeks 1 and 2 following PO-3A treatment. Results: ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly decreased after PO-3A, ​​while platelets were significantly decreased after PO-3A. has decreased significantly. /Endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), platelet-monocyte microparticle formation (p = 0.19) and verifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) were not significant suggesting thrombocytopenia. It only showed no tendency. activity. Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, closure time using the PFA-100 device, and expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), and CD40-ligand. (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and truncated (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Conclusions: Short-term treatment with PO-3A, ​​regardless of dose, already at week 1, provided a small reduction in platelet activity biomarkers despite combined aspirin and statin treatment compared with placebo. The effects of PO-3A are unique and different from other known antiplatelet agents, suggesting potential pleiotropic manifestations. These preliminary randomized data require confirmation in prospective studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	The results indicate that short-term treatment with PO-3A results in a modest reduction in certain markers of platelet activity, suggesting that these omega-3 acid ethyl esters have a unique effect on platelet function beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. The significant reductions observed in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, GP IIb/IIIa antigen and activity, and P-selectin after PO-3A treatment, compared to placebo, highlight a potential mechanism by which PO-3A may provide benefits in the context of disease. my heart. Platelets play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are fundamental in the development and progression of CAD. By reducing platelet activation and aggregation, PO-3A may help reduce the risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction, and thus potentially slow the progression of heart disease. The text states that the observed effects call for confirmation in future studies, suggesting that although the results are promising, more research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential and implications of PO-3A in heart disease. However, this study contributes valuable evidence to the discussion about the benefits of omega-3 acid ethyl esters in heart disease, especially with regard to their unique antiplatelet properties and their potential role in therapeutic strategies beyond conventional therapies.	1
12676734	This review outlines recent advances related to the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) waterway trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein that can interpret sorting signals by a variety of cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion in both regulatory and constitutive transport pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and transport events may also cause AQP2 membrane accumulation through cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and l-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) destruction of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis portion of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 constitutively recycles in epithelial cells and can be inserted into a variety of membrane domains in a variety of cell types both in vitro and in vivo and that these pathways can be regulated by factors including hypertonicity . The role of accessory proteins, including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins, in AQP2 membrane insertion is also being revealed. Understanding the cAMP-independent mechanism for membrane insertion of AQP2 is particularly relevant for therapeutic bypass of mutated and dysfunctional vasopressin receptors in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.		AQP2	sodium	While sodium nitroprusside is mentioned, it acts as a nitric oxide donor rather than demonstrating sodium interacting directly with AQP2 expression or trafficking. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence or discussion specifically regarding AQP2 expression that directly modulates sodium. To evaluate the original question regarding the interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression, one can look for research that directly investigates the effect of sodium levels on AQP2 expression, trafficking, or function. This could include studies of how sodium concentration affects the cellular localization, stability, or activity of AQP2, none of which are directly addressed in the given text.	0
29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is frequent (30–40% of patients) and carries a higher risk of HF hospitalization. , all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, and the direct detrimental effects of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in patients with HF and vice versa. This highlights the importance of active screening for both disorders in clinical practice. There are no specific limitations in the treatment of HF in T2DM. A subanalysis of trials addressing HF treatments in the general population found that all HF treatments were similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Regarding the treatment of T2DM in patients with heart failure, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first choice. Sulfonylureas and insulin have been traditional second- and third-line treatments, although their safety in heart failure is ambiguous. Neither glucagon-like prepeptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization. In fact, saxagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with heart failure (or at risk for heart failure). In a recent trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin both significantly reduced heart failure hospitalizations in patients with established cardiovascular disease or at risk for cardiovascular disease. It has been shown to decrease. Several ongoing trials should provide insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF and HFpEF patients without T2DM. Keywords: hypoglycemic agents; heart failure; heart failure hospitalization; heart failure treatment; Type 2 diabetes.		DPP4	metformin	To evaluate whether an interaction exists between metformin and the DPP4 gene, information is needed about pharmacogenetic studies, biochemical interactions, or clinical trials that specifically look at how metformin affects DPP4 gene expression or enzyme function. This information will include detailed discussions of the mechanisms of action of metformin that can affect the DPP4 pathway. In conclusion, while the text is useful for understanding the broader clinical implications of the use of different diabetes treatments in heart failure patients, it does not address the specific query about the interaction between metformin and the DPP4 gene. Therefore, a different source or text that focuses specifically on drug interactions or molecular effects of metformin on DPP4 will be needed.	0
38574433	Objective: Doxorubicin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent for cancer whose use is limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has received widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, growing evidence highlights the potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of semaglutide in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Methods and Results: Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly improved heart dysfunction caused by doxorubicin. RNA sequence analysis suggested that Bnip3 was a candidate gene impairing the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 in the effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 harboring adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter was transfected into the tail of C57/BL6J mice. BNIP3 was overexpressed by intravenous injection. Especially in my heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide-induced improvement in cardiac function. In vitro experiments showed that through the PI3K/AKT pathway, semaglutide reduced BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, thereby improving mitochondrial function. Conclusions: Semaglutide improves doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction through the PI3K/AKT pathway by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. Improvement of mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac damage and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential treatment to reduce acute cardiac toxicity induced by doxorubicin. Keywords: BNIP3; doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; mitochondria; PI3K/AKT; Semaglutide.		BNIP3	Semaglutide	The text provided is indeed useful for evaluating the interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene. It describes a study focusing on the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, in improving cardiotoxicity induced by the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin. Key findings include: Evidence of interaction: RNA sequencing identified BNIP3 as a candidate gene that may attenuate the protective effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This suggests a genetic interaction where BNIP3 expression likely modulates semaglutide efficacy in this context. Experimental validation: Additional experiments involving overexpression of BNIP3 in mice showed that increased levels of BNIP3 prevent semaglutide from improving cardiac function, suggesting that BNIP3 expression is inversely related to the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide. Mechanistic Insights: The text also states that semaglutide, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduces BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, which in turn improves mitochondrial function. This decrease in BNIP3 expression is directly related to semaglutide's ability to attenuate mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction. Therapeutic implications: The finding that semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via a pathway involving modulation of BNIP3 expression provides valuable insights into both the therapeutic mechanism of semaglutide and the role of BNIP3 in heart health. Overall, the text clearly demonstrates that there is an interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene, whereby semaglutide modulates BNIP3 expression to exert its therapeutic effects. This interaction is relevant to understanding how semaglutide may be used to potentially mitigate cardiac injury in clinical settings involving doxorubicin therapy. The details of the study presented will be crucial for any further research into the pharmacodynamics of semaglutide and its broader applications in cardiac therapies.	1
35455941	The GBA gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. Approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, which numerically makes it the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinically, GBA-related PD is identical to sporadic PD, except that it has an earlier age of onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment, and faster progression. Mutations in GBA can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key characteristic of PD is the presence of intraneuronal protein inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are primarily composed of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the GBA gene can lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which can impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. The GCase deficiency model demonstrates dysfunction of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. These dysfunctions may also lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, including accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramides, and glucosylsphingosines. Certain mutations can cause GCase to become misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), contributing to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, GCase deficiency has also been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which are associated with the pathogenesis of PD. In this review, we discuss pathways involved in GBA-PD and highlight potential treatments that target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		The text provided is very useful for evaluating whether there is an interaction between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the GBA gene. Here are several reasons that support its benefit: Clear connection between GBA mutations and PD: The text specifies that approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it an important genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. This direct association underscores the importance of the GBA gene in the context of Parkinson's disease. Detailed mechanistic insights: The text describes how mutations in the GBA gene can lead to loss of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. This dysfunction is critical because it impairs alpha-synuclein metabolism, a key process in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are a feature of Parkinson's disease. This provides a mechanistic link between GBA mutations and pathological features observed in PD. Biological consequences of GBA mutations: The review also demonstrates that GBA mutations can lead to loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. It details how these mutations can cause GCase misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and possibly contributing to neurodegeneration. This expands on the ways in which GBA mutations can impact cellular health and PD pathology. Association with clinical features of Parkinson's disease: GBA-associated Parkinson's disease is reported to be clinically similar to sporadic Parkinson's disease but with distinct features such as earlier age at onset, more rapid progression, and more frequent cognitive impairment. This differentiation is crucial for understanding the clinical impact of GBA mutations in PD patients. Therapeutic implications: The text highlights potential therapies targeting GCase to prevent neurodegeneration, which not only emphasizes the interaction between GBA and PD but also suggests practical applications of this knowledge in the development of therapeutic strategies.	1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by abnormal epidermal hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objective: To investigate the potential role of S-phase kinase-related protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis. Methods: Skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris, an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model, and cultured endothelial cells were analyzed for gene expression and protein by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. The level was assessed. (EC). Protein interactions, substrate ubiquitination, and degradation were examined in human umbilical vein EC using coimmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and cycloheximide chase analysis. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular EC (HDMEC) for BrdU incorporation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, Matrigel plug assays, and quantification of the vasculature of mouse lesions. Skp2 gene-wide knockout (KO) mice and endothelium-specific conditional KO mice were used. Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescence double staining indicates a close correlation between Skp2 expression and hypervascularization of the lesional dermal papilla. In HDMEC, Skp2 overexpression enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, has been identified as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. Selective inhibitors of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-induced PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination is dependent on phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In a mouse model, Skp2 gene deficiency alleviated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelium-specific Skp2 KO mice showed significant improvement in psoriasis with reduced papillary angiogenesis. Additionally, topical use of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented experimental psoriasis. Conclusions: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-related angiogenesis. Therefore, targeting Skp2-mediated angiogenesis may be a potential approach for the treatment of psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		The text provided is very useful for evaluating whether there is an interaction between psoriasis and the SKP2 gene. Here's an argument for its usefulness: Direct investigation of Skp2 in psoriasis: The aims of the study are clearly focused on examining the role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Skp2 is being studied in both human and animal models, providing a comprehensive view of its function and effects in the context of this disease. Increased expression in the course of the disease: Results showed that Skp2 expression is increased in skin samples taken from psoriasis patients as well as in the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model. This regulation in disease contexts suggests a potential pathogenic role for Skp2 in psoriasis. Association with psoriasis-associated angiogenesis: Skp2 is associated with hypervascularization in lesional dermal papillae, suggesting a specific role in the angiogenic aspect of psoriasis pathology. The text explains in detail how Skp2 overexpression promotes endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, which are key components of angiogenesis. Mechanistic Insights Involving Skp2 and PTEN: Study identifies PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction leads to degradation of PTEN, further implicating Skp2 in the molecular pathways that lead to psoriasis exacerbation, particularly through modulation of angiogenic processes. Therapeutic implications and genetic confirmation: The use of Skp2 inhibitors and gene knockout models (both global and endothelium-specific) show that reducing Skp2 activity or expression can significantly alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis and reduce the angiogenesis associated with the disease. These findings not only support a role for Skp2 in psoriasis but also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target. Extensive experimental approaches: The combination of gene expression analysis, protein interaction studies, and functional testing in cell culture and in vivo, coupled with the use of both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models, provides a strong body of evidence linking Skp2 to psoriasis pathology. In conclusion, the text is not only useful but also important in providing detailed evidence on the interaction between psoriasis and the SKP2 gene. It elucidates a specific biological pathway involving Skp2 that contributes to disease mechanisms and offers potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The clear demonstration of increased Skp2 activity in psoriatic lesions and its role in promoting pathological angiogenesis via PTEN degradation underscores the importance of Skp2 as a molecular link in psoriasis development.	1
38178103	Background: Some studies have shown that the gut microbiome may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effect between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as mediators remain unclear. Methods: Large-scale identification of gut microbiota, cytokines and five types of dementia: Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). I did. -Summary data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. Additionally, we investigated whether cytokines act as mediators in the pathway leading from the gut microbiota to dementia. Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal associations between the genetic liability of gut microbiota and dementia. Additionally, there were five positive causal effects and four negative causal relationships between cytokines and dementia. Cytokines did not act as mediators. Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally related to five types of dementia, and cytokines did not appear to be a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. Keywords: Cytokines; idiot; intestinal microflora; Mendelian randomization.	Dementia	IVW		The portion of text provided is not useful for evaluating whether there is an interaction between dementia and the IVW gene. Here are several points explaining why the text does not serve this purpose: Misinterpretation of “IVW”: The text uses the term “IVW” in the context of statistical analysis, and specifically refers to “inverse variance weighting.” IVW is a method used in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across multiple genetic instruments. It's not a gene, it's a statistical technique. Focus of the Study: The primary focus of the study is on causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia. The study aims to explore whether cytokines mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and dementia, using genetic data from GWAS and MR. No mention of the IVW gene: There is no discussion or mention of a gene called “IVW” in the context of genetics or molecular biology within the text. Therefore, the text cannot be used to evaluate any interaction involving a gene called “IVW” and dementia because “IVW” in this context refers to a systematic approach, not to a genetic entity. Conclusion imbalance: Because “IVW” refers to a method rather than a gene, the conclusions drawn from using this method (causal relationships between microbiota, cytokines, and types of dementia) do not provide information about gene-specific interactions that affect dementia. In summary, the text is useful for understanding the application of Mendelian randomization in exploring causal links between gut microbiota, cytokines and dementia but does not provide any insight into the interactions between dementia and a gene called “IVW” simply because “IVW” is not a gene but rather a statistical method used in the analysis. Therefore, the transcript cannot be used to evaluate genetic interactions involving a gene with this name in relation to dementia.	0
26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, a first-in-class agent approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and small lymphoma. In a dose-ranging study, idelalisib exposure increased in a low dose-proportional manner, possibly due to solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluation, with a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily permitted for specific toxicities. Idelalisib can be administered without regard to dose based on the absence of clinically relevant dose effects, and was dosed accordingly in the primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Co-administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79% increase in idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Use of the strong inducer rifampin resulted in a 75% decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and thus, co-administration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed primarily by AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice daily increased midazolam AUC by 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no significant effect on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was observed for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60% higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment. No relevant changes were observed with severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology program, including drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, that has allowed a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and their impact on clinical safety and efficacy. .	Breast Cancer		Idelalisib	Understanding the potential application of idelalisib in breast cancer will require data or studies that specifically address its effects on pathogenic mechanisms or treatment outcomes in breast cancer models or patients. Without such information, a definitive assessment of its efficacy against breast cancer cannot be made based on the text provided alone. This text is valuable for understanding the general pharmacological profile of idelalisib but is not sufficient to predict its potential benefits in the treatment of breast cancer.	0
27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare eye diseases, commonly associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate the clinical and laboratory features of episcleritis and scleritis associated with SLE, we now report 4 cases of patients with episcleritis or scleritis from September 2005 to July 2016 at the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Peking University People's Hospital. Secondary SLE was diagnosed. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarized along with treatment regimen and diagnosis. The literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patients. The mean age was (49.0 ± 23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1 ± 1.4) years. In addition to ocular involvement, patients may simultaneously present with phlegm symptoms, serositis, lupus nephritis, and interstitial pneumonia; Retrospectively, 1 patient experienced arthritis, 2 presented Raynaud's phenomenon, and 2 had hematologic involvement. All patients had a high titer of antinuclear antibody (ANA). Anti-double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were elevated in 2 patients. Three patients were positive for anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other 1 patient did not test for it. Complement levels were decreased in 3 patients. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores were greater than 4 points in all patients (range 7–16), suggesting active disease. Eye symptoms included pain, eye redness and tearing. Eye examination revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Of the 4 patients, 2 patients experienced ocular complications including loss of vision and uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids in combination with hydroxychloroquine. 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All of the 4 patients received a topical steroid and 1 patient received a periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide. 1 patient received a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during follow-ups. As a consequence, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including SLE. The presence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active SLE disease. Patients should be aware of ocular complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment was associated with good visual outcomes at follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	Although leflunomide is mentioned as part of the treatment regimen for one of the patients, the text does not specifically address its effectiveness or mechanism of action in the context of treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon has been noted as a condition experienced by some patients in the past, but there is no detailed analysis or discussion of whether leflunomide—or any of the other treatments mentioned—directly targets Eliminating or targeting the key pathogenic mechanisms of Raynaud's. To evaluate whether leflunomide may be effective for Raynaud's, one would look for specific discussions of its effects on vascular function, endothelial health, or other relevant pathophysiological aspects of Raynaud's. Such details will provide insight into whether leflunomide may offer therapeutic benefits or slow disease progression for Raynaud's patients. Finally, while the text is informative regarding the treatment of ocular symptoms in SLE patients and mentions leflunomide as part of the treatment regimen, it is too early to evaluate the efficacy of leflunomide in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon. Does not provide sufficient evidence or argument. Further research or articles focusing specifically on Raynaud's and the use of leflunomide in this context would be necessary to evaluate such findings.	0
21701167	Background: Prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been evaluated for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias, and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert its benefit by inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activation in patients with documented stable CAD, independent of the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Methods: Thirty patients with documented CAD and triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/day) and statins (simvastatin equivalence dose: 5-40 mg/day) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor. ™ Done up to 1. g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks after PO-3A therapy. Results: ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) significantly decreased after PO-3A. while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), platelet-monocyte microparticles formation (p = 0.19) and VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) showed only non-significant Proposed to reduce Platteland. Activity Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced accumulation, closure time with the PFA-100 device and thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40-ligand (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Conclusions: Independently of dose and as early as 1 week, short-term therapy with PO-3A provided a modest reduction in platelet activity biomarkers compared to placebo, as well as aspirin and statin therapy. The effect of PO-3A is unique, different from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests possible pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data call for confirmation in prospective studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	The results indicate that short-term therapy with PO-3A leads to modest reductions in specific markers of platelet activity, suggesting that these omega-3-acid ethyl esters may moderate the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins on platelet function. In addition, they have a unique effect. Significant reductions in ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation, GP IIb/IIIa antigen and activity, and P-selectin after PO-3A therapy compared with placebo, highlight a possible mechanism by which PO-3A confers benefits in context. can offer Heart disease. Platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are central to the development and progression of CAD. By reducing platelet activation and aggregation, PO-3A may help reduce the risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction, thereby potentially slowing the progression of heart disease. The text notes that the observed effects call for confirmation in prospective studies, indicating that while the results are promising, the therapeutic potential and implications of PO-3A in cardiovascular disease are not fully understood. More research is needed to understand. Nevertheless, this study provides valuable evidence for the debate on the benefits of omega-3-acid ethyl esters in cardiovascular disease, particularly their unique antiplatelet properties and potential for therapeutic strategies beyond conventional therapies.

12676734	This review outlines recent advances in the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be perceived by various cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, both in regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking events may also lead to AQP2 membrane accumulation through cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, which binds sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and L-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase) 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also show that AQP2 partially recycles in epithelial cells, can be inserted into different membrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that these pathways are involved in hypertonicity, including can be modulated by factors. A role for accessory proteins including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive element-binding protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion is also being uncovered. Understanding the cAMP-independent mechanism for membrane insertion of AQP2 is particularly relevant to the treatment of patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a mutated, dysfunctional vasopressin receptor.		AQP2	sodium	While sodium nitroprusside has been mentioned, it acts as a nitric oxide donor rather than directly elucidating the interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression or trafficking. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence or discussion specifically related directly to sodium modulating AQP2 expression. To examine the original question about the interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression, one would conduct studies that would directly investigate the effects of sodium levels on AQP2 expression, trafficking, or function. This may include studying how sodium concentration affects the cellular localization, stability, or activity of AQP2, none of which are directly addressed in the text.	0
29520964	Coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), with either reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30–40% of patients) and HF hospitalizations. is associated with a higher risk of , all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) deaths. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and the direct deleterious effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in clinical practice. There are no specific restrictions for HF treatment in T2DM. Sub-analyses of HF treatment trials in the general population have shown that all HF treatments are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Regarding T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulfonylurias and insulin have been traditional second- and third-line therapies, although their safety in HF is controversial. Neither glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, is associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown significant reductions in HF hospitalizations in patients with CV disease or at risk for CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM. Keywords: Glucose-lowering agents Heart failure; hospitalization for heart failure; Treatment of heart failure; Type 2 diabetes mellitus.		DPP4	metformin	To test whether there is an interaction between metformin and the DPP4 gene, information is needed from pharmacogenetic studies, biochemical interactions, or clinical trials that specifically investigate how metformin affects DPP4. Can affect gene expression or enzyme activity. Such information would include a detailed discussion of the mechanism of action of metformin that could potentially affect the DPP4 pathway. Finally, although the text is useful for understanding the broader clinical implications of using various diabetes treatments in heart failure patients, it does not address the specific question of the interaction between metformin and the DPP4 gene. For this, a different source or text focusing specifically on pharmacogenetic interactions or molecular effects of metformin on DPP4 would be required.	0
38574433	Objective: Doxorubicin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent for cancer, whose use is limited by its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a new analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has gained widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in reducing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Methods and Results: Doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly improved doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggested that Bnip3 was the candidate gene that impaired the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 was transfected with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) into the tail vein of C57/BLIPJ mice expressing the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter. The injection was done. Especially in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide-induced improvement in cardiac function. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide reduced BNIP3 expression in mitochondria through the PI3K/AKT pathway, improving mitochondrial function. Conclusion: Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction by downregulating BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Improvement of mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential therapy to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity. Keywords: BNIP3; doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; Mitochondria; PI3K/AKT; Semaglutide.		BNIP3	Semaglutide	The text provided is actually useful for evaluating the interaction between the drug semaglutide and the gene BNIP3. It describes a study focusing on the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, in reducing heart failure induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Key findings include: Evidence for interaction: RNA sequencing identified BNIP3 as a candidate gene that may mediate the protective effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This suggests a genetic interaction where BNIP3 expression potentially modulates the effectiveness of semaglutide in this context. Experimental validation: Further experiments involving BNIP3 overexpression in mice showed that increased levels of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide from improving cardiac function, indicating that BNIP3 expression is reversible. related to the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide. Mechanistic insight: The text also reports that semaglutide, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, downregulates BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, resulting in improved mitochondrial function. This decrease in BNIP3 expression is directly linked to semaglutide's ability to reduce mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction. Therapeutic Implications: The finding that semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity through a pathway involving modulation of BNIP3 expression would provide valuable insight into both the therapeutic mechanism of semaglutide and the role of BNIP3 in the cardia. Is. Overall, the text clearly shows that there is an interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene, in which semaglutide modulates the expression of BNIP3 to enhance its therapeutic effects. This interaction is relevant to understanding how semaglutide can potentially be used to reduce cardiac injury in clinical settings involving doxorubicin treatment. The study details provided will be important for further research into the pharmacodynamics of semaglutide and its wider use in cardiac therapy.	1
35455941	The GBA gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. About 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinically, GBA-associated PD is similar to sporadic PD, except for an earlier age of onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment, and more rapid progression. Mutations in GBA may be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are composed primarily of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the GBA gene can lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which can impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate impairment of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Some mutations cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, a GCase deficiency is also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with GBA-PD and highlights potential therapies that may work to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		The text provided is extremely useful for evaluating whether there is an interaction between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gene GBA. Here are several reasons supporting its usefulness: A clear link between GBA mutations and PD: The text states that about 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, making it a candidate for Parkinson's disease. Establishes as an important genetic risk factor. This direct association highlights the importance of the GBA gene in the context of PD. Detailed mechanistic insights: The text describes how mutations in the GBA gene can lead to loss of glucorebrosidase (GCase) activity and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. This dysfunction is critical because it affects alpha-synuclein metabolism, a key process in the pathogenesis of PD. Alpha-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, a hallmark of PD. This provides a mechanistic link between GBA mutations and the pathological features observed in PD. Biological Consequences of GBA Mutations: The Review further explains that GBA mutations can result from both loss and gain mechanisms. It describes how these mutations can cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and possibly contributing to neurodegeneration. are It expands on the ways in which GBA mutations can affect cellular health and PD pathology. Association with clinical features of PD: It has been noted that GBA-associated PD is clinically similar to sporadic PD but has distinctive features such as earlier age of onset, more rapid progression, and more frequent occurrence. Cognitive impairment. This distinction is important for understanding the clinical implications of GBA mutations in PD patients. Therapeutic Implications: The text highlights potential therapeutics targeting GCase to prevent neurodegeneration, indicating not only the interaction between GBA and PD but also the practical application of this knowledge in developing therapeutic strategies. Also suggests.	1
37850885	Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it is characterized by abnormal epidermal proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Abnormal expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objectives: To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis. Methods: Gene expression and protein levels were examined with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining in skin samples from psoriasis vulgaris and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice. model as well as from endothelial cells. (ECs). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination and degradation were examined in human umbilical vein ECs by co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting and cycloheximide chase assay. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays include quantification of vasculature in chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, Matrigel plug assay and mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelial-specific conditional KO mice were used. Results: Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression enhanced, while Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration and formation of tube-like structures. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated activation. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination is dependent on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In a mouse model, Skp2 gene depletion ameliorated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelial-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly improved psoriasis with reduced angiogenesis of papillae. Furthermore, topical application of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented experimental psoriasis. Conclusion: The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in angiogenesis associated with psoriasis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach for the treatment of psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		The text provided is extremely useful for evaluating whether there is an interaction between psoriasis and the SKP2 gene. Here is an argument supporting its utility: Direct Investigation of Skp2 in Psoriasis: Study Objectives To specifically examine the role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Focus on. Skp2 is studied in both human and animal models, providing a comprehensive view of its function and effects in the context of this disease. Increased expression in the context of disease: Results showed increased Skp2 expression in skin samples from patients with psoriasis as well as in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis. This upregulation in the context of the disease suggests a possible pathogenic role of Skp2 in psoriasis. Link to Psoriasis-Associated Angiogenesis: Skp2 is associated with excessive vascularity in lesional dermal papillae, indicating a specific role in the angiogenic aspect of psoriasis pathology. The text describes how Skp2 overexpression increases endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, which are key components of angiogenesis. Mechanistic insights involving Skp2 and PTEN: Study identifies PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated inhibition. This interaction leads to degradation of PTEN, further implicating Skp2 in molecular pathways that promote psoriasis, particularly through modulation of the angiogenic process. Therapeutic implications and genetic validation: The use of Skp2 inhibitors and genetic knockout models (both global and endothelial-specific) show that reducing Skp2 activity or expression can significantly reduce psoriasis symptoms and prevent disease. May reduce associated angiogenesis. These findings not only support a role for Skp2 in psoriasis but also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target. Comprehensive experimental approach: A combination of gene expression analyses, protein interaction studies, and functional assays in cell culture and in vivo, with the use of both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models, provides a strong body of evidence linking Skp2 to psoriasis pathology. Provides a set. In conclusion, the text is not only useful but also important in providing detailed evidence of the interaction between psoriasis and the gene SKP2. This defines a specific biological pathway involving Skp2 that contributes to disease mechanisms, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The clear demonstration of increased Skp2 activity in psoriasis lesions and its role in promoting pathological angiogenesis through PTEN degradation underscores the importance of Skp2 as a molecular link in psoriasis progression.	1
38178103	Background: Some studies suggest that gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as mediators remain unclear. Methods: Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia ( PDD) was identified. - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data at scale. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. Results: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between gut microbiota and genetic susceptibility to dementia. In addition, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementia. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Conclusions: Gut microbiota and cytokines were mainly associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines do not seem to be mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. Keywords: cytokines dementia gut microbiota; Mendelian randomization.	Dementia	IVW		The text snippet provided is not useful for evaluating whether there is an interaction between the disease dementia and the gene "IVW". Here are several points that illustrate why the text does not serve this purpose: Misinterpretation of "IVW": The text uses the term "IVW" in the context of statistical analysis, specifically "Inverse Variance Weighting." Refers to IVW is a method used in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across multiple genetic instruments. It is not a gene, but a statistical technique. Study focus: The study focuses on the causal relationship between gut microbiota, cytokines, and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia. The aim of this study is to explore whether cytokines mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and dementia using genetic data from GWAS and MR. No mention of the gene IVW: There is no discussion or mention of the gene "IVW" in the context of genetics or molecular biology within the text. Therefore, the text cannot be used to infer an interaction between "IVW" and the dementia gene because "IVW" in this context refers to a mechanism, not a genetic entity. Result misalignment: Because “IVW” refers to a method rather than a gene, the results (causal relationships between microbiota, cytokines, and dementia types) using this method may not be relevant to dementia. do not provide information about gene-specific genetic interactions. In summary, this text is useful for understanding the application of Mendelian randomization in finding causal links between gut microbiota, cytokines, and dementia, but it does not provide any insight into the interaction between dementia and the "IVW" gene. is because "IVW". Not a gene but a statistical method used in the analysis. Thus, the text cannot be used to assess genetic interactions involving genes with this name in relation to dementia.	0
