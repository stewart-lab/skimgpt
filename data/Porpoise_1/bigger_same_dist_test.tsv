47	47	Diabetic bone disease is a complication of type I and type II diabetes, both of which are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. Increased hip and foot fracture rates do not correlate well with changes in bone mineral density (BMD), whereas studies support the importance of collagen structure to bone strength. Extracellular lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of hydroxylysine and lysine residues in collagens resulting in aldehydes that subsequently form critically important biosynthetic crosslinks that stabilize functional collagens. Although LOX-dependent biosynthetic crosslinks in bone collagen are deficient in diabetic bone, the expression and regulation of bone LOXs in diabetes have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we found that LOX is profoundly downregulated in bone in diabetes. Moreover, we have identified a novel metabolic regulatory relationship that is dysregulated in diabetes using mouse models. Data indicate that the incretin (gastric hormone) known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that is anabolic to osteoblasts strongly upregulates LOX, and that this regulation is disrupted in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in mice. In vivo and in vitro studies support that diabetes results in elevated circulating peripheral dopamine, likely also derived from the gut, and is responsible for blocking GIP signaling and LOX levels in osteoblasts. Moreover, peripheral administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist amisulpride to diabetic mice restored trabecular bone structure to near normal and partially reversed downregulation of LOX. Taken together our data identifies a novel metabolic relationship between the gut-derived hormone GIP and bone-derived LOX, and points to the importance of LOX dysregulation in the pathology of diabetic bone disease. © 2019 The Authors. <i>JBMR Plus</i> published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.	0.0	Diabetes	LOX	
122	122	Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a familial heart disease partly caused by impaired desmosome turnover. Thus, stabilization of desmosome integrity may provide new treatment options. Desmosomes, apart from cellular cohesion, provide the structural framework of a signaling hub. Here, we investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cardiomyocyte cohesion. We inhibited EGFR under physiological and pathophysiological conditions using the murine plakoglobin-KO AC model, in which EGFR was upregulated. EGFR inhibition enhanced cardiomyocyte cohesion. Immunoprecipitation showed an interaction of EGFR and desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Immunostaining and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed enhanced DSG2 localization and binding at cell borders upon EGFR inhibition. Enhanced area composita length and desmosome assembly were observed upon EGFR inhibition, confirmed by enhanced DSG2 and desmoplakin (DP) recruitment to cell borders. PamGene Kinase assay performed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes treated with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, revealed upregulation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Erlotinib-mediated desmosome assembly and cardiomyocyte cohesion were abolished upon ROCK inhibition. Thus, inhibiting EGFR and, thereby, stabilizing desmosome integrity via ROCK might provide treatment options for AC.	1.0	Heart Disease		erlotinib
96	96	HIV-induced chronic inflammation, immune activation and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are linked with adverse metabolic changes known to cause cardiovascular adversities. This study evaluates the prevalence of lipodystrophy, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and analyses risk factors in HIV-infected Ethiopians taking cART. A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted at tertiary-level hospitals. Eligible participants attending the HIV clinics were enrolled. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical, HIV treatment variables, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose level, risk factors and components of MetS, also lipodystrophy, were studied. Data were analysed by SPSS statistical package V.25 with descriptive and analytical statistics. For multivariable analysis of risk factors, a logistic regression model was used. Results were presented in frequency and percentages, mean±SD, or median+IQR. Statistical significance was taken as p<0.05. Among 518 studied participants, two-thirds were females, and the mean age of the study population was 45 years (SD=11). The mean duration of cART was 10 years (SD=4). Median CD4 count was 460 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The prevalence of MetS according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (2005) criteria was 37.6%. In multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for MetS were age >45 years (aHR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4), female sex (aHR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8), body mass index (BMI)<u>></u>25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (aHR 2.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.1), efavirenz-based cART (aHR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 4.8) and lopinavir/ritonavir-based cART (aHR 3.7, 95% CI 1.0 to 13.3). The prevalence of lipodystrophy was 23.6%. Prior exposure to a stavudine-containing regimen was independently associated with lipodystrophy (aHR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 6.1). Our study revealed 38% of the participants had MetS indicating considerable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. Independent risk factors for MetS were BMI≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, efavirenz and lopinavir/ritonavir-based cART, female sex and age ≥45 years. In addition to prevention, CVD risk stratification and management will reduce morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection.	0.0		AHR	stavudine
85	85	The aim of this study was to investigate NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox regulation in astrocytes by Ginsenoside Rb1 subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and to reveal the neuroprotective mechanism of ginseng. Neonatal mouse brain was used to culture primary astrocytes. The third generation of the primary astrocytes was used for the experiments. OGD/R was introduced by culturing the cells in a glucose-free media under nitrogen for 6 h followed by a regular culture for 24 h. Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury in a dose-dependent manner. It improved the mitochondrial function of OGD/R astrocytes indicated by improving mitochondrial distribution, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhancing mitochondrial DNA copies and ATP production. Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly lifted intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH, NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>, and GSH/GSSG in OGD/R astrocytes. It inhibited the protein expression of both PARP1 and CD38, while attenuating the SIRT1 drop in OGD/R cells. In line with its effects on PARP1, Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced the expression of poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) proteins in OGD/R cells. Ginsenoside Rb1 also significantly increased the expression of NAMPT and NMNAT2, both of which are key players in NAD/NADH synthesis. The results suggest that the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox involves the protective effects of ginsenoside Rb1 against OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury.	1.0		NAMPT	ginsenoside rb1
134	134	To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and their association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected adults in a rural sub-county hospital in Kenya. This was a descriptive survey of patient charts characterising cardiovascular risk among adult patients (> 18 years) at Ukwala sub-county hospital between June 2013 and January 2015. Post-stratification survey weights were applied to obtain prevalence levels. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for each variable related to cardiovascular risk factors were calculated using logistic regression models. Overall, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 0.4%, 0.3% of patients had had a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), 40.4% had pre-hypertension, while 10.4% had stage 1 and 2.9% stage 2 hypertension. Up to 14% of patients had elevated non-fasting total cholesterol levels. Factors associated with hypertension were male gender (AOR 1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), being over 40 years of age (AOR 1.78, <i>p</i> = 0.0001) and having an increased waist circumference (OR 2.56, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). Raised total cholesterol was more likely in those on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (AOR 2.2, p = 0.0042), azidothymidine (AZT) (AOR 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0004) and stavudine (D4T) -containing regimens (AOR 3.13, <i>p</i> = 0.0002). An elevated prevalence of undiagnosed cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and raised total cholesterol levels was found among people living with HIV. There was an association between raised total cholesterol and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) -based ART regimens. Our findings provide further rationale for integrating routine cardiovascular risk-factor screening into HIV-care services.	0.0	Diabetes		stavudine
140	140	Due to potential ethnic differences in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, new therapeutics need to be evaluated in Japanese patients. We aimed to assess the safety and glycaemic efficacy of tirzepatide as an add-on treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with stable doses of various oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapies. This multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial was conducted at 34 medical research centres and hospitals in Japan. Eligible participants were aged 20 years or older with inadequately controlled (HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥7·0% to <11·0%) type 2 diabetes and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy (sulfonylureas, biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinedione, glinides, or SGLT2 inhibitors) for at least 3 months (stable dose for ≥8 weeks before screening), had a BMI of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, and stable bodyweight (±5%) for at least 3 months before screening. After a 2-week screening and 2-week lead-in period, all participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 5, 10, or 15 mg of tirzepatide, administered once per week subcutaneously for 52 weeks followed by a 4 week safety follow-up period, using a computer-generated random sequence and interactive web response system, stratified by oral antihyperglycaemic medication group. All participants started receiving 2·5 mg tirzepatide and doses were escalated by 2·5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability during 52 weeks of treatment, assessed as incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861039. Between March 30, 2019, and Feb 16, 2021, with recruitment and enrolment continuing until Feb 4, 2020, 484 participants were assessed for eligibility and 443 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of tirzepatide (148 [33%] in the 5 mg group, 147 [33%] in the 10 mg group, and 148 [33%] in the 15 mg group). 398 (90%) participants completed the study and treatment. Most participants (343 [77%] of 443) had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent in the tirzepatide 15 mg group (125 [84%] of 148) than the 5 mg (109 [74%] of 148) and 10 mg groups (109 [74%] of 147). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events with tirzepatide were mild or moderate nasopharyngitis (75 [17%]), nausea (74 [17%]), constipation (54 [12%]), diarrhoea (51 [12%]), and decreased appetite (44 [10%]). At week 52, mean changes from baseline in bodyweight were -3·8 kg (SE 0·5; -5·1% reduction) in the 5 mg group, -7·5 kg (0·5; -10·1% reduction) in the 10 mg group, and -10·2 kg (0·5; -13·2% reduction) in the 15 mg group. Least squares mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline reduced from 8·5% (SE 0·1) to 6·0% (0·1) in the 5 mg tirzepatide group, from 8·6% (0·1) to 5·6% (0·1) in the 10 mg group, and from 8·6% (0·1) to 5·6% (0·1) in the 15 mg group at week 52. No adjudication-confirmed deaths were reported. Tirzepatide was well tolerated as an add-on to oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes and showed improvement in glycaemic control and bodyweight, irrespective of background oral antihyperglycaemic medication. Tirzepatide is a potential new treatment option for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with single oral antihyperglycaemic medication. Eli Lilly and Company.

98	98	Increased expression of eicosanoids in cancer has been associated with adverse prognosis. We performed a randomized phase II trial to test the hypothesis that inhibitors of two eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], celecoxib and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX], zileuton) added to chemotherapy would improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC, a performance status of 0 to 2, and no prior therapy were eligible. All patients received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 mg/mL x min day 1 + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) days 1 and 8. Patients were randomly assigned to (a) zileuton 600 mg PO qid, (b) celecoxib 400 mg PO bid, or (c) celecoxib and zileuton at the same doses. Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and 5-LOX was performed without knowledge of outcomes. One hundred forty patients were entered and 134 were eligible and treated. There was no survival difference between the arms. COX-2 expression was a negative prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.51, P = .019 for index >or= 4; HR = 4.16, P = .005 for index = 9) for patients not receiving celecoxib. Patients with increased COX-2 expression (index >or= 4), receiving celecoxib had better survival than did COX-2-expressing patients not receiving drug (HR = .342, P = .005 for OS; HR = .294, P = .002 for failure-free survival). Multivariate analysis confirmed the interaction of COX-2 and celecoxib on survival. 5-LOX expression was neither prognostic nor predictive. This study failed to demonstrate the value of dual eicosanoid inhibition or benefit from either agent alone in addition to chemotherapy. However, a prospectively defined subset analysis suggests an advantage for celecoxib and chemotherapy for patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression.	1.0		LOX	zileuton
67	67	Protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) is upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and expression levels correlate with the grade of malignancy in gliomas. A similar correlation was reported for its interacting partner 14-3-3β, which has been shown to facilitate the interaction of PTPIP51 with cRAF (Raf1). Since the interaction of these signalling partners stimulates growth factor signalling downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a major drug target in GBM, we here investigated the impact of EGFR inhibition by small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibody on PTPIP51. The effect of EGFR inhibition on PTPIP51 mRNA, protein expression and its interaction profile in GBM was analyzed using the U87 cell line as model system. The transferability of the results to in vivo conditions was evaluated in cultured tumour cells from GBM patients. Cells were treated either to the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR Gefitinib or the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab in a time and dose dependent manner. Gefitinib treatment decreased the proliferation rate and induced apoptosis in U87 and primary tumour cells. The PTPIP51 interaction profile changed in correlation to the applied Gefitinib. Despite unchanged mRNA levels PTPIP51 protein was reduced. In contrast, treatment with Cetuximab had no effects on PTPIP51 expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the impact of EGFR inhibition by Gefitinib on PTPIP51 protein expression, a downstream regulator of MAPK signalling. These data will serve as a basis to unravel the precise role of PTPIP51-mediated signalling in GBM and its potential implications for Gefitinib-mediated therapy in future studies.	1.0		RAF1	gefitinib
66	66	Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The ability of miR-7 to enhance gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was evaluated in this study. We found that miR-7 significantly decreased the IC50 of gefitinib and inhibited cell growth. G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were increased after the treatment of gefitinib coupled with miR-7 transfection. In addition, levels of Raf1, IGF1R, and PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK were also significantly decreased. Our results suggest that miR-7 may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLCs.	1.0		RAF1	gefitinib
53	53	Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has a role in controlling postprandial metabolic tone. In humans, a GIP receptor (GIPR) variant (Q354, rs1800437) is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and increased risk for Type 2 Diabetes. To better understand the impacts of GIPR-Q354 on metabolism, it is necessary to study it in an isogeneic background to the predominant GIPR isoform, E354. To accomplish this objective, we used CRISPR-CAS9 editing to generate mouse models of GIPR-Q354 and GIPR-E354. Here we characterize the metabolic effects of GIPR-Q354 variant in a mouse model (GIPR-Q350). We generated the GIPR-Q350 mice for in vivo studies of metabolic impact of the variant. We isolated pancreatic islets from GIPR-Q350 mice to study insulin secretion ex vivo. We used a β-cell cell line to understand the impact of the GIPR-Q354 variant on the receptor traffic. We found that female GIPR-Q350 mice are leaner than littermate controls, and male GIPR-Q350 mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, in line with the association of the variant with reduced BMI in humans. GIPR-Q350 mice of both sexes are more glucose tolerant and exhibit an increased sensitivity to GIP. Postprandial GIP levels are reduced in GIPR-Q350 mice, revealing feedback regulation that balances the increased sensitivity of GIP target tissues to secretion of GIP from intestinal endocrine cells. The increased GIP sensitivity is recapitulated ex vivo during glucose stimulated insulin secretion assays in islets. Generation of cAMP in islets downstream of GIPR activation is not affected by the Q354 substitution. However, post-activation traffic of GIPR-Q354 variant in β-cells is altered, characterized by enhanced intracellular dwell time and increased localization to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN). Our data link altered intracellular traffic of the GIPR-Q354 variant with GIP control of metabolism. We propose that this change in spatiotemporal signaling underlies the physiologic effects of GIPR-Q350/4 and GIPR-E350/4 in mice and humans. These findings contribute to a more complete understanding of the impact of GIPR-Q354 variant on glucose homeostasis that could perhaps be leveraged to enhance pharmacologic targeting of GIPR for the treatment of metabolic disease.	1.0	Diabetes	GIPR	
2	2	In current research, two functional components, <i>i.e.</i>, hydrazone and bisphenol sulfide were combined to get useful supramolecules in medicinal chemistry. Herein 25 new 4,4'-thiodiphenol bis-acylhydrazones were synthesized in good to excellent yields. Initially ethyl-2-chloroacetate was reacted with 4,4'-thiodiphenol, which was further reacted with excess hydrazine hydrate to produce 2,2'-((thiobis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))di(acetohydrazide), which was then combined with various aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to get the desired products (hydrazones, 4a-4y). The synthesized supramolecules were characterized by contemporary spectroscopic techniques such as <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The synthetic compound's cholinesterase blocking activity was tested against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes where compounds 4n, and 4h showed excellent inhibitory potential for AChE, while 4b, and 4h, demonstrated most potent inhibition of BChE. The starting compound (SM3) and compounds 4h and SM3 depicted excellent dual inhibitory capabilities for both enzymes. The chemical basis of anticholinesterase activity was investigated using a structure-based molecular docking approach. The biological significance and the ease of synthesis of this class of compounds should be considered in therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease treatments.	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
130	130	Hedgehog signals are transduced through Patched receptors to the Smoothened (SMO)-SUFU-GLI and SMO-Gi-RhoA signaling cascades. MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as <i>BCL2, FOXA2, FOXE1, FOXF1, FOXL1, FOXM1, GLI1, HHIP, PTCH1</i> and <i>WNT2B</i>, in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis, immune evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired <i>SMO</i> mutations, <i>SUFU</i> deletions, <i>GLI2</i> amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/β-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione B and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
127	127	Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the most widely characterized of the three vertebrate Hedgehog homologs, and is essential for proper embryonic development. Shh binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptch1), resulting in the de-repression of Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the activation of Gli2, which regulates the transcription of target genes that include Gli1 and Ptch1. Several synthetic and naturally occurring small-molecule modulators of Smo have been discovered. Shh-signaling antagonists that bind to Smo include cyclopamine, SANT1, and Cur-61414. Shh signaling agonists that bind to Smo include the synthetic small molecules purmorphamine and SAG. Small molecules that inhibit Shh signaling downstream of Smo, GANT58 and GANT61 have also been reported. Robotnikinin inhibits the Shh pathway by directly targeting Shh. Although progress has been made in understanding and modulating Shh signaling, fundamental aspects of Shh signal transduction remain obscure, including the mechanism(s) whereby Ptch1 regulates Smo activity. Small-molecule modulators of Shh signaling provide a means to regulate the activity of a pathway implicated in medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and developmental disorders. Several Shh inhibitors have not succeeded in the clinic for unknown reasons, but clinical trials in BCC and pancreatic cancer with the promising Smo antagonists GDC-0449 and IPI-926 are currently underway.	0.0	Pancreatic cancer		gant61
0	0	Several cholinesterase inhibitors are either being utilized for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease or are in advanced clinical trials. E2020, marketed as Aricept, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range. Our experimental structure of the E2020-TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the 'oxyanion hole', but only indirectly via solvent molecules. Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.	0.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE	
25	25	In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and involved mechanisms of resveratrol on an established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) murine model. Wild-type and autophagic mediator ULK1 heterozygous knockout mice were induced to have NAFLD by high-fat diet for 8weeks. After that, resveratrol treatment was applied with the high-fat diet feeding for another 4weeks. Typical features of NAFLD, including histological changes, fibrosis, insulin resistance, oxidative status, and inflammation were characterized. After-treatment with resveratrol showed ameliorative effects on all measured features of NAFLD, from histology, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance to oxidative stress and inflammation. resveratrol treatment also reduced the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through the restoration of its inhibitor IκBα. Partial inhibition of ULK1 expression impaired the ameliorative effects of resveratrol on hepatic histology, fibrosis, oxidative status, inflammation, and NF-κB activity. In conclusion, resveratrol improved NAFLD-caused hepatic injury partially through regulating autophagic and IκBα-NF-κB pathways.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
1	1	Like acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and is hence a viable therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by a cholinergic deficit. Potent, reversible, and brain-targeted BChE inhibitors (cymserine analogs) were developed based on binding domain structures to help elucidate the role of this enzyme in the central nervous system. In rats, cymserine analogs caused long-term inhibition of brain BChE and elevated extracellular ACh levels, without inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase. In rat brain slices, selective BChE inhibition augmented long-term potentiation. These compounds also improved the cognitive performance (maze navigation) of aged rats. In cultured human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid precursor protein, and secreted beta-amyloid peptide levels were reduced without affecting cell viability. Treatment of transgenic mice that overexpressed human mutant amyloid precursor protein also resulted in lower beta-amyloid peptide brain levels than controls. Selective, reversible inhibition of brain BChE may represent a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, improving cognition and modulating neuropathological markers of the disease.	1.0	Alzheimer’s	BCHE

81	81	mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 target--ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin, pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, short-term pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria, which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles (mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death. Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell--survival or cell death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy.	1.0		ULK1	pp242
6	6	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. It has emerged that Abeta toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Deltatau) and absence of tau in tau(-/-) mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Abeta toxicity. Deltatau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Abeta-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Abeta toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD.	1.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
14	14	Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by distinctive craniofacial appearance, short stature, and congenital heart disease. Approximately 80% of individuals with NS harbor mutations in genes whose products are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the underlying genetic causes in nearly 20% of individuals with NS phenotype remain unexplained. Here, we report four de novo RRAS2 variants in three individuals with NS. RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A>T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A>T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly. The same dose injection of mRNA encoding c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu) caused severe developmental impairments and low dose overexpression of this variant induced craniofacial defects. In contrast, the RRAS2 c.224T>G (p.Phe75Cys) change, located on the same allele with p.Gln72His in an individual with NS, resulted in no aberrant in vitro or in vivo phenotypes by itself. Together, our findings suggest that activating RRAS2 mutations can cause NS and expand the involvement of RRAS2 proto-oncogene to rare germline disorders.	1.0	Heart Disease	RAF1	
105	105	The incretin system is an essential metabolic axis that regulates postprandial metabolism. The two incretin peptides that enable this effect are the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which have cognate receptors (GIPR and GLP-1R) on islet β cells as well as in other tissues. Pharmacologic engagement of the GLP-1R is a proven strategy for treating hyperglycemia in diabetes and reducing body weight. Tirzepatide is the first monomeric peptide with dual activity at both incretin receptors now available for clinical use, and in clinical trials it has shown unprecedented effects to reduce blood glucose and body weight. Here, we discuss the foundational science that led to the development of monomeric multi-incretin receptor agonists, culminating in the development of tirzepatide. We also look to the future of this field and comment on how the concept of multi-receptor agonists will continue to progress for the treatment of metabolic disease.	1.0		GIPR	tirzepatide
43	43	Cancer is a major health problem in the U.S and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is known to increase the risk for the development of many cancers. Metformin, a first-line therapy for treating T2DM, is increasingly being used for its anticancer effects; however, the literature is limited on the effect of metformin dose on overall survival in patients with stage IV cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to the last known follow-up or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive on December 31, 2016 were censored. In this cohort study we examined the relationship between metformin dose and overall survival in persons with both T2DM and stage IV lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreas cancers. We used a retrospective study design with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 2007-2016 of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER) dataset. Of the 7,725 patients, 2,981(38.5%) had been prescribed metformin. Patients who used metformin had significantly better overall survival in both unadjusted (Unadjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76; p < 0.001) and adjusted models (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.81; p < 0.001). The overall survival between patients who took metformin with average daily dose ≥ 1000mg or < 1000mg were not statistically significant (aHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.08; p = 0.90). Metformin use regardless of dose is associated with increased overall survival in older adults with stage IV cancer.	0.0	Diabetes	AHR	
28	28	Irbesartan has shown significant therapeutic effects in hypertensive patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To determine the underlying mechanisms of its action, we established an <i>in vitro</i> model of NAFLD by treating human and mouse hepatocytes with free fatty acids (FFAs) and angiotensin (Ang) II. Irbesartan significantly reversed AngII/FFA-induced lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers. In addition, irbesartan also increased the autophagy flux, in terms of increased numbers of autolysosomes and autophagosomes, and the upregulation and mitochondrial localization of the autophagic proteins Atg5 and LC3BII/I. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of the autophagic flux exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in the steatotic hepatocytes. Furthermore, AngII upregulated PKC which inhibited AMPK phosphorylation via direct interaction with the AngII receptor AT1-R. Irbesartan inhibited PKC and activated AMPK and its downstream effector ULK1, thereby inducing autophagy, decreasing lipid deposition, and restoring mitochondrial function. Taken together, irbesartan triggers autophagy via the PKC/AMPK/ULK1 axis to ameliorate the pathological changes in the steatotic hepatocytes.	1.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	ULK1	
63	63	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumour in the central nervous system (CNS). As the ideal targets for GBM treatment, Src family kinases (SFKs) have attracted much attention. Herein, a new series of imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2-one derivatives were designed and synthesised as SFK inhibitors. Compounds <b>1d</b>, <b>1e</b>, <b>1q</b>, <b>1s</b> exhibited potential Src and Fyn kinase inhibition in the submicromolar range, of which were next tested for their antiproliferative potency on four GBM cell lines. Compound <b>1s</b> showed effective activity against U87, U251, T98G, and U87-EGFRvIII GBM cell lines, comparable to that of lead compound PP2. Molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation revealed the possible binding patterns of the most active compound <b>1s</b> in ATP binding site of SFKs. ADME prediction suggested that <b>1s</b> accord with the criteria of CNS drugs. These results led us to identify a novel SFK inhibitor as candidate for GBM treatment.	1.0		FYN	PP2
49	49	Lipids are an essential constituent of the cell membrane of which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the most important component. Activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) induces the release of PUFAs from the cell membrane that form precursors to both pro- and ant-inflammatory bioactive lipids that participate in several cellular processes. PUFAs GLA (gamma-linolenic acid), DGLA (dihomo-GLA), AA (arachidonic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are derived from dietary linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) by the action of desaturases whose activity declines with age. Consequently, aged cells are deficient in GLA, DGLA, AA, AA, EPA and DHA and their metabolites. LA, ALA, AA, EPA and DHA can also be obtained direct from diet and their deficiency (fatty acids) may indicate malnutrition and deficiency of several minerals, trace elements and vitamins some of which are also much needed co-factors for the normal activity of desaturases. In many instances (patients) the plasma and tissue levels of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA are low (as seen in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus) but they do not have deficiency of other nutrients. Hence, it is reasonable to consider that the deficiency of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA noted in these conditions are due to the decreased activity of desaturases and elongases. PUFAs stimulate SIRT1 through protein kinase A-dependent activation of SIRT1-PGC1α complex and thus, increase rates of fatty acid oxidation and prevent lipid dysregulation associated with aging. SIRT1 activation prevents aging. Of all the SIRTs, SIRT6 is critical for intermediary metabolism and genomic stability. SIRT6-deficient mice show shortened lifespan, defects in DNA repair and have a high incidence of cancer due to oncogene activation. SIRT6 overexpression lowers LDL and triglyceride level, improves glucose tolerance, and increases lifespan of mice in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects at the transcriptional level. PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory metabolites influence the activity of SIRT6 and other SIRTs and thus, bring about their actions on metabolism, inflammation, and genome maintenance. GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (pro- and anti-inflammatory metabolites of AA respectively) activate/suppress various SIRTs (SIRt1 SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6), PPAR-γ, PARP, p53, SREBP1, intracellular cAMP content, PKA activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). This implies that changes in the metabolism of bioactive lipids as a result of altered activities of desaturases, COX-2 and 5-, 12-, 15-LOX (cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenases respectively) may have a critical role in determining cell age and development of several aging associated diseases and genomic stability and gene and oncogene activation. Thus, methods designed to maintain homeostasis of bioactive lipids (GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA, DHA, PGE2, LXA4) may arrest aging process and associated metabolic abnormalities.	0.0	Diabetes	LOX	
97	97	Lipid signaling is dysregulated in many diseases with vascular pathology, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-α. To better understand the protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. ω-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary ω-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the ω-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that ω-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of ω-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation. It also suggests that cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen (but not lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton) might be used without losing the beneficial effect of dietary ω-3 PUFA.	1.0		LOX	zileuton
115	115	The activity of Ras, a small GTPase protein, is increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> on the activation of Ras, and the involvement of the Ras hyperactivity in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced deficits in spatial cognition and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in mice (Aβ-mice) enhanced hippocampal Ras activation and expression, while 60 min incubation of hippocampal slices in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ-slices) only elevated Ras activity. Aβ-mice showed deficits in spatial cognition and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, but basal synaptic transmission was enhanced. The above effects of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> were corrected by the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS). ERK2 phosphorylation increased, and Src phosphorylation decreased in Aβ-mice and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices. Both were corrected by FTS. In CA1 pyramidal cells of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, the response of AMPA receptor and phosphorylation of GluR1 were enhanced with dependence on Ras activation rather than ERK signaling. In contrast, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function and GluN2A/2B phosphorylation were downregulated in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-slices, which was recovered by application of FTS or the Src activator ouabain, and mimicked in control slices treated with the Src inhibitor PP2. The administration of PP2 impaired the spatial cognition and LTP induction in control mice and FTS-treated Aβ-mice. The treatment of Aβ-mice with ouabain rescued Aβ-impaired spatial cognition and LTP. Overall, the results indicate that the oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> hyperactivates Ras and thereby causes the downregulation of Src which impedes NMDAR-dependent LTP induction resulting in cognitive deficits.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
5	5	Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.	1.0	Alzheimer’s	FYN	
56	56	Current antidotal regimens for organophosphorus compound (OP) poisoning consist of a combination of pretreatment with a spontaneously reactivating AChE inhibitor such as pyridostigmine bromide, and postexposure therapy with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine sulfate and oximes such as 2-PAM chloride (Gray, 1984). Although these antidotal regimens are effective in preventing lethality of animals from OP poisoning, they do not prevent postexposure incapacitation, convulsions, performance deficits, or, in many cases, permanent brain damage (Dunn and Sidell, 1989). These problems stimulated the development of enzyme bioscavengers as a pretreatment to sequester highly toxic OPs before they reach their physiological targets. Several studies over the last two decades have demonstrated that exogenously administered human serum butyrylcholinesterase (Hu BChE) can be used successfully as a safe, efficacious, and single prophylactic treatment to counteract the toxicity of OPs. It also has potential use for first responders (civilians) reacting to terrorist nerve gas release, pesticide overexposure, or succinylcholine-induced apnea. A dose of 200 mg of Hu BChE in humans is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment that can protect from exposure of 2-5 x LD50 of nerve agents (Ashani, 2000).	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
18	18	Shixiao San (SXS) is a traditional Chinese formula that has been widely used in clinical practice to treat blood stasis syndromes, such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic, thrombosis and coronary heart disease. However, the effectiveness and mechanism of SXS have not been studied in detail yet. Current study aimed to identify the compounds in SXS, evaluate the formula efficacies using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and verify the pharmacological effects by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The compounds in SXS were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF-MS. Potential target genes for identified compounds were obtained from three databases. DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. PPI network was constructed to screen core targets. Molecular docking was used to examine interactions between active compounds and potential targets. The mechanism was also verified by model of acute blood stasis rats and human umbilical vein cells. In total, 45 compounds were identified from SXS. Among the detected phytochemicals, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, D-catechin, naringenin and amentoflavone were identified as the active constituents. SXS is primarily involved in the modulation of hypoxic state, vascular regulation, and inflammation response, according to GO and KGG pathway enrichment analysis. A network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was constructed and five core targets were identified as VEGFA, AKT1, EGFR, PTGS2, and MMP9. Molecular docking simulation revealed good binding affinity of the five putative targets with the corresponding compounds. SXS reduced HIF-1α and COX-2 levels and increased the eNOS expression levels in hypoxic HUVECs. SXS can reduce the whole blood viscosity in adrenaline induced acute blood stasis rats and relieve blood stasis. SXS removes blood stasis might through VEGFA/AKT/eNOS/COX-2 pathway and flavonoids are the main active components in the formula.	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR	
116	116	Although amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the mechanisms of Aβ neurotoxicity remain to be clarified. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Aβ on postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) tyrosine phosphorylation. Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying it may be a promising therapy in AD. Aβ25-35 oligomers (20 μg/rat) were administered intracerebroventricularly in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot was applied for measuring the protein levels of PSD-95 and β-actin. Following 3, 7, 14, 21 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 increased significantly, and peaked at 3 days after oligomeric Aβ25-35 treatment in hippocampal CA1 subfield. Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SrcPTKs) specific inhibitor PP2 attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 induced by Aβ25-35. Amantadine [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor noncompetitive antagonist], NVP-AAM077 (GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) and Ro25-6981 (GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor selective inhibitor) also suppressed the Aβ25-35-induced PSD-95 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that Aβ oligomers induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-95 by SrcPTKs, which is mediated by the activation of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors.	1.0	Alzheimer’s		PP2
73	73	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of cases. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are observed in approximately 40% and 20% of patients with NSCLC in Asian and non-Asian populations, respectively. First-generation (gefitinib, erlotinib) and second-generation (afatinib, dacomitinib) EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been standard-of-care (SoC) first-line treatment for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation positive advanced NSCLC following Phase III trials versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. However, most patients treated with first-line first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs develop resistance. Osimertinib, a third-generation, central nervous system active EGFR-TKI which potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI sensitizing (EGFRm) and the most common EGFR T790 M resistance mutations, has shown superior efficacy versus first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib / erlotinib). Osimertinib is now a treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFRm in the first-line setting, and treatment of choice for patients with T790 M positive NSCLC following disease progression on first-line EGFR-TKIs. The second-generation EGFR-TKI dacomitinib has also recently been approved for the first-line treatment of EGFRm positive metastatic NSCLC. There remains a need to determine appropriate sequencing of EGFR-TKIs in this setting, including EGFR-TKIs as monotherapy or in combination with other TKIs / signaling pathway inhibitors. This review considers the evolving role of sequencing treatments to maximize benefits for patients with EGFRm positive advanced NSCLC.	1.0		EGFR	erlotinib
92	92	To evaluate the incidence and determinants of diabetes in a cohort of HIV-infected adults initiated with combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) in 1997-1999 and followed up to 2009. Prospective study of 1046 patients at 47 French clinical sites. Potential determinants of diabetes occurrence, defined by confirmed increased glycemia and/or initiation of antidiabetic treatment, were assessed by a proportional hazards model, including time-updated metabolic parameters and ART exposure. Among the cohort, representing 7846 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 54% received indinavir, 75% stavudine and 52% didanosine. Overall, 111 patients developed diabetes, with an incidence of 14.1/1000 PYFU (14.6 in men, 12.6 in women). Incidence peaked in 1999-2000 (23.2/1000 PYFU) and decreased thereafter. The incidence of diabetes was associated [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), all P<0.02] with older age (hazard ratio = 2.13 when 40-49 years, hazard ratio = 3.63 when ≥50 years), overweight (hazard ratio = 1.91 for a BMI 25-29 kg/m(2), hazard ratio = 2.85 >30 kg/m(2)), waist-to-hip ratio (hazard ratio = 3.87 for ≥0.97 male/0.92 female), time-updated lipoatrophy (hazard ratio = 2.14) and short-term exposure to indinavir (0-1 year hazard ratio = 2.53), stavudine (0-1 year hazard ratio = 2.56, 1-2 years hazard ratio = 2.65) or didanosine (2-3 years hazard ratio = 3.16). Occurrence of diabetes was not associated with HIV-related markers, hepatitis C, hypertension or family history of diabetes. Insulin resistance was predictive for incident diabetes. In this nationwide cohort, followed for 10 years after cART initiation, diabetes incidence peaked in 1990-2000, was markedly higher than that reported for European uninfected or other HIV-infected populations (4-6/1000 PYFU) and linked with age and adiposity. Adiposity and glycemic markers should be monitored in aging HIV-infected patients.	0.0		AHR	stavudine
21	21	The protective effect of statins in cirrhosis and its decompensation in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients remains unknown. We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2009. A total of 298,761 CHB patients were identified. CHB patients using statins (n=6,543; defined as ≥28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD)) and a 1:1 ratio propensity score and inception point (the date of first use of statins)-matched non-statins (<28 cDDD) were followed up from the inception point until the development of cirrhosis or its decompensation or until withdrawal from insurance or December 2009. After adjustment for competing mortality, CHB patients using statins had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cirrhosis (relative risk)=0.433; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.344-0.515; modified log-rank test, P<0.001) and decompensated cirrhosis (relative risk=0.468; 95% CI=0.344-0.637; P<0.001) compared with patients not using statins. After adjustment for age, gender, comorbidity index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, aspirin use, diabetes medication, CHB treatment, non-statin lipid-lowering drugs, and triglyceride lipid-lowering drugs using the Cox proportional hazard model, statins were still an independent protector against cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=0.512; 95% CI=0.413-0.634; P<0.001) and its decompensation (AHR=0.534; 95% CI=0.433-0.659; P<0.001). The AHRs for cirrhosis were 0.467 and 0.200, and the AHRs for decompensated cirrhosis were 0.611 and 0.231 with 91-365 and >365 cDDD of statins, respectively. CHB patients who receive statin therapy have a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of cirrhosis and its decompensation.	0.0	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	AHR	
133	133	Lipodystrophy is common in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs), stavudine, and zidovudine. Adipocytokines may be altered in lipodystrophy. We evaluated risk factors, adipocytokine levels, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles in HIV-infected adolescents with different lipodystrophy types. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 80 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents receiving PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy for ≥ 6 months. Patients underwent oral glucose tolerance tests and measurements of high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, resistin, insulin, and lipids. They were classified into 3 groups based on the clinical findings no lipodystrophy, isolated lipoatrophy, and any lipohypertrophy (isolated lipohypertrophy or combined type). Of the 80 patients (median age, 16.7 years), 18 (22.5%) had isolated lipoatrophy, while 8 (10%) had any lipohypertrophy (four with isolated lipohypertrophy, and four with the combined type). In a multivariate analysis, longer exposure to stavudine (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p = 0.005) and indinavir (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p = 0.012) were associated with lipoatrophy, while longer exposure to didanosine (OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.017) and indinavir (OR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21; p = 0.045) were associated with any lipohypertrophy. Leptin levels were highest in the any-lipohypertrophy group and lowest in the isolated-lipoatrophy group (p = 0.013). HMW adiponectin levels were significantly lowest in the any-lipohypertrophy group and highest in the no-lipodystrophy group (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in the levels of resistin among the three groups (p = 0.234). The prevalence of insulin resistance (p = 0.002) and prediabetes/diabetes (p < 0.001) were significantly highest in the any-lipohypertrophy group. Patients with lipoatrophy and those without lipodystrophy had comparable degrees of insulin resistance (p = 0.292). In multiple linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and waist-height ratio, HMW adiponectin levels were associated with Matsuda index (β = 0.5; p = 0.003) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (β = 40.1; p = 0.010) and almost significantly associated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.054). Leptin and resistin levels were not associated with HOMA-IR, Matsuda index, or QUICKI (all p > 0.05). Abnormal glucose metabolism and dysregulation of adipocytokines were common in the HIV-infected adolescents with lipohypertrophy and the combined type. Preventive screening for cardiovascular diseases caused by metabolic alterations should be routinely performed.	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
34	34	The nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is considered a very promising therapeutic target because it is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Although many inhibitors have been prepared and tested, clinical trials have shown that NAMPT inhibition may result in severe haematological toxicity. Therefore, the development of conceptually new inhibitors is an important and challenging task. We synthesized ten β-d-iminoribofuranosides bearing various heterocycle-based chains carbon-linked to the anomeric position starting from non-carbohydrate derivatives. They were then submitted to NAMPT inhibition assays, as well as to pancreatic tumor cells viability and intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion evaluation. The biological activity of the compounds was compared to that of the corresponding analogues lacking the carbohydrate unit to assess, for the first time, the contribution of the iminosugar moiety to the properties of these potential antitumor agents.	1.0	Pancreatic cancer	NAMPT	
135	135	<b>Introduction</b> Efficient antiretroviral-treatment (ART) generally allows control of HIV infection. However, persons-living-with-HIV (PLWH), when aging, present a high prevalence of metabolic diseases. <b>Area covered</b> Altered adiposity, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, diabetes, and their consequences are prevalent in PLWH and could be partly related to ART. <b>Expert opinion</b> At first, personal and lifestyle factors are involved in the onset of these complications. The persistence of HIV in tissue reservoirs could synergize with some ART and enhance metabolic disorders. Altered fat repartition, diagnosed as lipodystrophy, has been related to first-generation nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors (NRTIs) (stavudine zidovudine) and some protease inhibitors (PIs). Recently, use of some integrase-inhibitors (INSTI) resulted in weight/fat gain, which represents a worrisome unresolved situation. Lipid parameters were affected by some first-generation NRTIs, non-NRTIs (efavirenz) but also PIs boosted by ritonavir, with increased total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Insulin resistance is common associated with abdominal obesity. Diabetes incidence, high with first-generation-ART (zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine, indinavir) has declined with contemporary ART close to that of the general population. Metabolic syndrome, a dysmetabolic situation with central obesity and insulin resistance, and liver steatosis are common in PLWH and could indirectly result from ART-associated fat gain and insulin resistance. All these dysmetabolic situations increase the atherogenic cardiovascular risk.	1.0	Diabetes		stavudine
15	15	Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension, inflammation, renal disease progression, and cardiovascular disease. However, no data are available regarding the effect of allopurinol in patients with chronic kidney disease. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of 113 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) <60 ml/min. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with allopurinol 100 mg/d (n = 57) or to continue the usual therapy (n = 56). Clinical, biochemical, and inflammatory parameters were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment. The objectives of study were (1) renal disease progression; (2) cardiovascular events; and (3) hospitalizations of any causes. Serum uric acid and C-reactive protein levels were significantly decreased in subjects treated with allopurinol. In the control group, eGFR decreased 3.3 +/- 1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and in the allopurinol group, eGFR increased 1.3 +/- 1.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) after 24 months. Allopurinol treatment slowed down renal disease progression independently of age, gender, diabetes, C-reactive protein, albuminuria, and renin-angiotensin system blockers use. After a mean follow-up time of 23.4 +/- 7.8 months, 22 patients suffered a cardiovascular event. Diabetes mellitus, previous coronary heart disease, and C-reactive protein levels increased cardiovascular risk. Allopurinol treatment reduces risk of cardiovascular events in 71% compared with standard therapy. Allopurinol decreases C-reactive protein and slows down the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, allopurinol reduces cardiovascular and hospitalization risk in these subjects.	0.0	Heart Disease	EGFR	
36	36	The function of a new long non-coding RNA linc00673 remains unclear. While identified as an oncogenic player in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), linc00673 was found to be anti-oncogenic in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However whether linc00673 regulated malignancy and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has not been characterized. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch assays and transwell invasion assays. Epithelial mesenchymal transition was examined using western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Interaction between miRNA and linc00673 was determined using luciferase reporter assays. In vivo experiments were performed to assess tumor formation. In addition, the expression data of NSCLC specimens of TCGA and patient survival data were utilized to explore the prognostic significance of linc00673. In the present study, we found high linc00673 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. In vitro experiments showed linc00673 knockdown reversed TGF-β induced EMT, and miR-150-5p was predicted to target linc00673 through bioinformatics tools. Overexpression of miR-150-5p suppressed lin00673's expression while inhibition of miR-150-5p led to significant upregulation of lin00673, suggesting that linc00673 could be negatively regulated by miR-150-5p, which was further confirmed by the inverse correlation between linc00673 and miR-150-5p in NSCLC patients' specimen. Furthermore, we proved that miR-150-5p could directly target linc00673 through luciferase assay, so linc00673 could sponge miR-150-5p and modulate the expression of a key EMT regulator ZEB1 indirectly. In addition, miR-150-5p inhibition abrogated linc00673 silence mediated proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT suppressing effect. Moreover, the inhibition of linc00673 significantly attenuated the tumorigenesis ability of A549 cells in vivo. We validated linc00673 as a novel oncogenic lncRNA and demonstrated the molecular mechanism by which it promotes NSCLC, which will advance our understanding of its clinical significance.	0.0	Pancreatic cancer	CCK	
59	59	Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is a stoichiometric bioscavenger that protects from the toxicity of nerve agents. Non-human primates are suitable models for toxicity studies that cannot be performed in humans. We evaluated the biochemical properties of native macaque (MaBChE) tetramers, compared to recombinant MaBChE monomers, PEGylated recombinant MaBChE tetramers and monomers, and native HuBChE tetramers. K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values for butyrylthiocholine were independent of subunit assembly status. The K<sub>m</sub> for all forms of MaBChE was about 70 μM, compared to 13 μM for HuBChE. The k<sub>cat</sub> was about 100,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for MaBChE and 30,000 min<sup>-1</sup> for HuBChE. The reversible inhibitor ethopropazine had similar K<sub>i</sub> values of 0.05 μM for all MaBChE forms and HuBChE. The bimolecular rate constant, ki, for inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog of sarin, was 2.2 to 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> for all MaBChE forms and for HuBChE. A major difference between MaBChE and HuBChE was the rate of reactivation by 2-PAM. The second order rate constant for reactivation of DFP-inhibited MaBChE by 2-PAM was 1.4 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, but was 380 fold faster for DFP-inhibited HuBChE (k<sub>r</sub> 531 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>). The acyl pocket of MaBChE has Leu285 in place of Pro285 in HuBChE. The reactivation rate of DFP-inhibited HuBChE mutant P285L by 2-PAM was reduced 5.8-fold (k<sub>r</sub> 92 M<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) indicating that P285 determines whether 2-PAM binds in an orientation that favors release of diisopropylphosphate. DFP-inhibited MaBChE treated with 0.2 M 2-PAM recovered 10% of its original activity, whereas DFP-inhibited HuBChE recovered 80% activity. It was concluded that the biochemical properties of MaBChE are similar to those of HuBChE except for the reactivation of DFP-inhibited BChE.	1.0		BCHE	2 pam
60	60	Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against beta-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the alpha7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD.	1.0		FYN	PP2
93	93	In Mozambique during 2004-2007 numbers of adult patients (≥15 years old) enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) increased about 16-fold, from <5,000 to 79,500. All ART patients were eligible for co-trimoxazole. ART program outcomes, and determinants of outcomes, have not yet been reported. In a retrospective cohort study, we investigated rates of mortality, attrition (death, loss to follow-up, or treatment cessation), immunologic treatment failure, and regimen-switch, as well as determinants of selected outcomes, among a nationally representative sample of 2,596 adults initiating ART during 2004-2007. At ART initiation, median age of patients was 34 and 62% were female. Malnutrition and advanced disease were common; 18% of patients weighed <45 kilograms, and 15% were WHO stage IV. Median baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was 153/µL and was lower for males than females (139/µL vs. 159/µL, p<0.01). Stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine or efavirenz were prescribed to 88% of patients; only 31% were prescribed co-trimoxazole. Mortality and attrition rates were 3.4 deaths and 19.8 attritions per 100 patient-years overall, and 12.9 deaths and 57.2 attritions per 100 patient-years in the first 90 days. Predictors of attrition included male sex [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-1.8], weight <45 kg (AHR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9, reference group >60 kg), WHO stage IV (AHR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4, reference group WHO stage I/II), lack of co-trimoxazole prescription (AHR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), and later calendar year of ART initiation (AHR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8). Rates of immunologic treatment failure and regimen-switch were 14.0 and 0.6 events per 100-patient years, respectively. ART initiation at earlier disease stages and scale-up of co-trimoxazole among ART patients could improve outcomes. Research to determine reasons for low regimen-switch rates and increasing rates of attrition during program expansion is needed.	0.0		AHR	stavudine
61	61	The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system to inject the bacterial CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells. Within the host cell, CagA becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and initiates cytoskeletal rearrangements. We demonstrate here that Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases mediate CagA phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. First, the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 specifically blocks CagA phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangements thereby inhibiting the CagA-induced hummingbird phenotype of gastric epithelial cells. Second, CagA is in vivo phosphorylated by transiently expressed c-Src. Third, recombinant c-Src and lysates derived from c-Src-expressing fibroblasts but not lysates derived from Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells phosphorylated CagA in vitro. Fourth, a transfected CagA-GFP fusion protein is phosphorylated in vivo in Src-positive fibroblasts but not in Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells. Because a CagA-GFP fusion protein mutated in an EPIYA motif is not efficiently phosphorylated in any of these fibroblast cells, the CagA EPIYA motif appears to constitute the major c-Src phosphorylation site conserved among CagA-positive Helicobacter strains.	1.0		FYN	PP2
