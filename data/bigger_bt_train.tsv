26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, which is a first-in-class agent to be approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, likely because of solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluations, with dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily being allowed for specific toxicities. Idelalisib may be administered without regard to food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant food effects, and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79 % increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Administration with the potent inducer rifampin resulted in a 75 % decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and, as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice-daily dosing increases the midazolam AUC 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no meaningful impact on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was noted for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60 % higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment; no relevant changes were observed with severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology programme, including drug-drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, which has allowed a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and their impact on clinical safety and efficacy.	Breast Cancer		Idelalisib	Understanding the potential application of Idelalisib in breast cancer would require data or studies that specifically address its impact on the pathogenic mechanisms or therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer models or patients. Without such information, one cannot conclusively evaluate its usefulness against breast cancer based on the provided text alone. The text is valuable for understanding Idelalisib's general pharmacological profile but not sufficient to assess its potential benefits in breast cancer therapy.	0
27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare ocular diseases, which are commonly associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate clinical and laboratory features of SLE-associated episcleritis and scleritis, we now report 4 cases of inpatients who were diagnosed with episcleritis or scleritis secondary to SLE from September 2005 to July 2016 in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology in Peking University People's Hospital. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarized together with the treatment regimen and the prognosis; the literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patients. The average age was (49.0±23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1±1.4) years. In addition to the eye involvement, the patients had mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis and interstitial pneumonia simultaneously; in the past, 1 patient experienced arthritis, 2 presented Raynaud's phenomenon, and 2 had hematologic involvement. All the patients had antinuclear antibody (ANA) of high titer. The anti double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were increased in 2 patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other 1 patient did not test it. The complement levels were decreased in 3 patients. The systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores were more than 4 points in all the patients (ranging from 7-16), suggesting active disease. Ocular symptoms included pain, redness of the eye and tears. Ophthalmic examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Among the 4 patients, 2 patients experienced ocular complications including decrease in vision and uveitis. All the patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with hydroxycloroquine; 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All of the 4 patients received topical steroid and 1 patient received periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide; 1 patient received topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during the follow-ups. As a conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including SLE. The occurrence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active disease of SLE. Ocular complications need to be aware of in the patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment was associated with good visual outcomes in the follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	While leflunomide is mentioned as part of the treatment regimen for one of the patients, the text does not delve into its effectiveness or mechanism of action specifically in the context of treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is noted as a condition experienced by some of the patients in the past, but there is no detailed analysis or discussion on whether leflunomide—or any other treatment mentioned—was directly aimed at alleviating or targeting the key pathogenic mechanisms of Raynaud's.    To evaluate whether leflunomide could be effective for Raynaud's, one would look for specific discussions on its impact on vascular function, endothelial health, or other relevant pathophysiological aspects of Raynaud's. Such details would provide insight into whether leflunomide could offer therapeutic benefits or slow disease progression for Raynaud's patients.    In conclusion, while the text is informative regarding the treatment of ocular manifestations in SLE patients and mentions leflunomide as part of a treatment regimen, it does not offer sufficient evidence or discussion to evaluate leflunomide's efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Further research or texts focusing specifically on Raynaud's and the use of leflunomide in that context would be necessary for such an evaluation.	0
21701167	Prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been tested for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert their benefit via inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Thirty patients with documented CAD and triglycerides over 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/daily) and statins (simvastatin equivalence dose: 5-40 mg/daily) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor™ 1 g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or a placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks following PO-3A therapy. ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), formation of platelet-monocyte microparticles (p = 0.19) and the VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) only exhibited nonsignificant trends suggestive of reduced platelet activity. Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, closure time with the PFA-100 device and expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40-ligand (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Independently of the dose and already at 1 week, short-term therapy with PO-3A provided a modest reduction of platelet activity biomarkers, despite concomitant aspirin and statin therapy, when compared to a placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests potential pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data call for confirmation in prospective studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	The results indicate that short-term therapy with PO-3A leads to a modest reduction in certain markers of platelet activity, suggesting that these omega-3-acid ethyl esters have a unique effect on platelet function beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. The significant reductions observed in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, GP IIb/IIIa antigen and activity, and P-selectin after PO-3A therapy, compared to a placebo, highlight a potential mechanism through which PO-3A could offer benefits in the context of heart disease.    Platelets play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are central to the development and progression of CAD. By reducing platelet activation and aggregation, PO-3A might help to lower the risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction, thereby potentially slowing the progression of heart disease.    The text mentions that the effects observed call for confirmation in prospective studies, indicating that while the findings are promising, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential and implications of PO-3A in heart disease. Nonetheless, this study contributes valuable evidence to the discussion on the benefits of omega-3-acid ethyl esters in heart disease, especially regarding their unique antiplatelet properties and potential role in therapeutic strategies beyond conventional treatments.	1
12676734	This review outlines recent advances related to the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be interpreted by different cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, in both regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking events can also lead to AQP2 membrane accumulation via cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and l-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and by membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 recycles constitutively in epithelial cells, it can be inserted into different membrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and these pathways can be modulated by factors including hypertonicity. The roles of accessory proteins, including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion, are also being uncovered. Understanding cAMP-independent mechanisms for membrane insertion of AQP2 is especially relevant to the therapeutic bypassing of the mutated, dysfunctional vasopressin receptor in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.		AQP2	sodium	While sodium nitroprusside is mentioned, it serves as a nitric oxide donor rather than directly illustrating an interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression or trafficking. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence or discussion specifically related to sodium modulating AQP2 expression directly.    To evaluate the original question regarding sodium's interaction with AQP2 expression, one would look for research directly investigating the impact of sodium levels on AQP2 expression, trafficking, or function. This could include studies on how sodium concentration affects AQP2's cellular localization, stability, or activity, none of which are directly addressed in the given text.	0
29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30-40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.		DPP4	metformin	To evaluate whether there exists an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4, information is needed on pharmacogenetic studies, biochemical interactions, or clinical trials that specifically investigate how metformin might influence DPP4 gene expression or enzyme functionality. Such information would involve detailed discussions on the mechanisms of action of metformin that could potentially impact the DPP4 pathway.  In conclusion, while the text is useful for understanding the broader clinical implications of using various diabetes treatments in heart failure patients, it does not address the specific query about an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4. For that, a different source or text focusing specifically on pharmacogenetic interactions or the molecular effects of metformin on DPP4 would be required.	0
38574433	Doxorubicin is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent for cancer, whose use is limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a novel analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has received widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggested that Bnip3 is the candidate gene that impaired the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter was injected into tail vein of C57/BL6J mice to overexpress BNIP3, specifically in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented the improvement in cardiac function caused by semaglutide. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide, via PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced BNIP3 expression in the mitochondria, improving mitochondrial function. Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction via PI3K/AKT pathway, by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. The improvement in mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential therapy to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.		BNIP3	Semaglutide	The text provided is indeed useful for evaluating the interaction between the drug semaglutide and the gene BNIP3. It describes a study focused on the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, in ameliorating cardiotoxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Key findings include:  Evidence of Interaction: RNA sequencing identified BNIP3 as a candidate gene that may impair the protective effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This suggests a genetic interaction where BNIP3 expression potentially modifies the effectiveness of semaglutide in this context.  Experimental Verification: Further experiments involving overexpression of BNIP3 in mice showed that increased levels of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide from improving cardiac function, which indicates that BNIP3 expression is inversely related to the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide.  Mechanistic Insights: The text also mentions that semaglutide, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduces BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, which in turn improves mitochondrial function. This reduction in BNIP3 expression is directly linked to semaglutide's ability to mitigate mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction.  Therapeutic Implications: The conclusion that semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via a pathway that includes modulation of BNIP3 expression offers valuable insights into both the therapeutic mechanism of semaglutide and the role of BNIP3 in cardiac health.  Overall, the text clearly demonstrates that there is an interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene, with semaglutide modulating the expression of BNIP3 to exert its therapeutic effects. This interaction is relevant for understanding how semaglutide can be used to potentially mitigate cardiac injury in clinical settings involving doxorubicin treatment. The study details provided would be critical for any further research into the pharmacodynamics of semaglutide and its broader applications in cardiac therapeutics.	1
35455941	The <i>GBA</i> gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. Approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Clinically, <i>GBA</i>-associated PD is identical to sporadic PD, aside from the earlier age at onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment and more rapid progression. Mutations in <i>GBA</i> can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies, which are made up primarily of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene may lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which may impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate dysfunction of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to aberrant lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Certain mutations cause GCase to be misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, a GCase deficiency has also been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with <i>GBA</i>-PD and highlights potential treatments which may act to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gene GBA. Here are several reasons supporting its usefulness:  Clear Connection Between GBA Mutations and PD: The text specifies that approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, establishing it as a significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. This direct association underlines the importance of the GBA gene in the context of PD.  Detailed Mechanistic Insights: The text describes how mutations in the GBA gene may lead to loss of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. This dysfunction is crucial as it impairs alpha-synuclein metabolism, a key process in the pathogenesis of PD. Alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of PD. This provides a mechanistic link between GBA mutations and the pathological features observed in PD.  Biological Consequences of GBA Mutations: The review further explains that GBA mutations can result in both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. It details how these mutations can cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. This expands on the ways in which GBA mutations can influence cellular health and PD pathology.  Association with Clinical Features of PD: It is mentioned that GBA-associated PD is clinically similar to sporadic PD but with distinct features like an earlier age at onset, more rapid progression, and more frequent cognitive impairment. This differentiation is critical for understanding the clinical impact of GBA mutations in PD patients.  Therapeutic Implications: The text highlights potential treatments targeting GCase to prevent neurodegeneration, which not only underscores the interaction between GBA and PD but also suggests practical applications of this knowledge in developing therapeutic strategies.	1
37850885	Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it features abnormal epidermal proliferation, infiltrating inflammatory cells and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis. Gene expression and protein levels were evaluated with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model, as well as from cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination and degradation were examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and a cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein ECs. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, the Matrigel plug assay and quantification of vasculature in the mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelial-specific conditional KO mice were used. Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-triggered PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination depended on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In the mouse model, Skp2 gene deficiency alleviated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelial-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly ameliorated psoriasis with diminished angiogenesis of papillae. Furthermore, topical use of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented the experimental psoriasis. The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach to treating psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease psoriasis and the gene SKP2. Here's an argument supporting its usefulness:  Direct Investigation of Skp2 in Psoriasis: The study's objectives clearly focus on examining the role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Skp2 is studied in both human and animal models, providing a comprehensive view of its function and effects in the context of this disease.  Increased Expression in Disease Context: The results show that Skp2 expression is increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis as well as in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis. This upregulation in disease contexts suggests a potential pathogenic role of Skp2 in psoriasis.  Link to Psoriasis-Associated Angiogenesis: Skp2 is associated with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae, indicating a specific role in the angiogenic aspect of psoriasis pathology. The text details how Skp2 overexpression enhances endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, which are key components of angiogenesis.  Mechanistic Insights Involving Skp2 and PTEN: The study identifies PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction leads to the degradation of PTEN, further implicating Skp2 in the molecular pathways that exacerbate psoriasis, particularly through the modulation of angiogenic processes.  Therapeutic Implications and Genetic Confirmation: Use of Skp2 inhibitors and genetic knockout models (both global and endothelial-specific) demonstrate that reducing Skp2 activity or expression can significantly ameliorate psoriasis symptoms and reduce disease-associated angiogenesis. These findings not only support the role of Skp2 in psoriasis but also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.  Broad Experimental Approaches: The combination of gene expression analysis, protein interaction studies, and functional assays in cell culture and in vivo, along with the use of both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models, provides a robust set of evidence linking Skp2 with psoriasis pathology.  In conclusion, the text is not only useful but also critical in providing detailed evidence of an interaction between psoriasis and the gene SKP2. It elucidates a specific biological pathway involving Skp2 that contributes to disease mechanisms, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The clear demonstration of increased Skp2 activity in psoriasis lesions and its role in promoting pathological angiogenesis via PTEN degradation underlines the importance of Skp2 as a molecular link in the progression of psoriasis.	1
38178103	Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear. Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.	Dementia	IVW		The piece of text provided is not useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease dementia and the gene "IVW". Here are several points that clarify why the text does not serve this purpose:  Misinterpretation of "IVW": The text uses the term "IVW" in the context of statistical analysis, specifically referring to "Inverse Variance Weighting". IVW is a method used in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across multiple genetic instruments. It is not a gene, but rather a statistical technique.  Focus of the Study: The primary focus of the study is on the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia. The study aims to explore if cytokines mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and dementia, using genetic data from GWAS and MR.  No Mention of Gene IVW: There is no discussion or mention of a gene called "IVW" in the context of genetics or molecular biology within the text. Therefore, the text cannot be used to assess any interaction involving a gene named "IVW" and dementia because "IVW" in this context refers to a methodological approach, not a genetic entity.  Conclusion Misalignment: Since "IVW" refers to a method rather than a gene, the conclusions drawn from using this method (causal relationships between microbiota, cytokines, and dementia types) do not provide information about genetic interactions specific to a gene influencing dementia.  In summary, the text is useful for understanding the application of Mendelian randomization in exploring causal links between gut microbiota, cytokines, and dementia but it does not provide any insight into interactions between dementia and a gene called "IVW" simply because "IVW" is not a gene but a statistical method used in the analysis. Thus, the text cannot be used to evaluate genetic interactions involving a gene with that name in relation to dementia.	0
15201414	An open-label study indicated that selective depletion of B cells with the use of rituximab led to sustained clinical improvements for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To confirm these observations, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. We randomly assigned 161 patients who had active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate to receive one of four treatments: oral methotrexate (> or =10 mg per week) (control); rituximab (1000 mg on days 1 and 15); rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (750 mg on days 3 and 17); or rituximab plus methotrexate. Responses defined according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) were assessed at week 24 (primary analyses) and week 48 (exploratory analyses). At week 24, the proportion of patients with 50 percent improvement in disease symptoms according to the ACR criteria, the primary end point, was significantly greater with the rituximab-methotrexate combination (43 percent, P=0.005) and the rituximab-cyclophosphamide combination (41 percent, P=0.005) than with methotrexate alone (13 percent). In all groups treated with rituximab, a significantly higher proportion of patients had a 20 percent improvement in disease symptoms according to the ACR criteria (65 to 76 percent vs. 38 percent, P< or =0.025) or had EULAR responses (83 to 85 percent vs. 50 percent, P< or =0.004). All ACR responses were maintained at week 48 in the rituximab-methotrexate group. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first rituximab infusion: at 24 weeks, serious infections occurred in one patient (2.5 percent) in the control group and in four patients (3.3 percent) in the rituximab groups. Peripheral-blood immunoglobulin concentrations remained within normal ranges. In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment, a single course of two infusions of rituximab, alone or in combination with either cyclophosphamide or continued methotrexate, provided significant improvement in disease symptoms at both weeks 24 and 48.

20870100	Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by persistent synovitis, systemic inflammation, and autoantibodies (particularly to rheumatoid factor and citrullinated peptide). 50% of the risk for development of rheumatoid arthritis is attributable to genetic factors. Smoking is the main environmental risk. In industrialised countries, rheumatoid arthritis affects 0·5-1·0% of adults, with 5-50 per 100 000 new cases annually. The disorder is most typical in women and elderly people. Uncontrolled active rheumatoid arthritis causes joint damage, disability, decreased quality of life, and cardiovascular and other comorbidities. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the key therapeutic agents, reduce synovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function. The leading DMARD is methotrexate, which can be combined with other drugs of this type. Biological agents are used when arthritis is uncontrolled or toxic effects arise with DMARDs. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were the first biological agents, followed by abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab. Infections and high costs restrict prescription of biological agents. Long-term remission induced by intensive, short-term treatment selected by biomarker profiles is the ultimate goal.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Rituximab		1
28264816	Recent insights in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) necessitated updating the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) RA management recommendations. A large international Task Force based decisions on evidence from 3 systematic literature reviews, developing 4 overarching principles and 12 recommendations (vs 3 and 14, respectively, in 2013). The recommendations address conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GC); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, clazakizumab, sarilumab and sirukumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and the targets of sustained clinical remission (as defined by the American College of Rheumatology-(ACR)-EULAR Boolean or index criteria) or low disease activity are discussed. Cost aspects were taken into consideration. As first strategy, the Task Force recommends MTX (rapid escalation to 25 mg/week) plus short-term GC, aiming at >50% improvement within 3 and target attainment within 6 months. If this fails stratification is recommended. Without unfavourable prognostic markers, switching to-or adding-another csDMARDs (plus short-term GC) is suggested. In the presence of unfavourable prognostic markers (autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions, failure of 2 csDMARDs), any bDMARD (current practice) or Jak-inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD or tsDMARD is recommended. If a patient is in sustained remission, bDMARDs can be tapered. For each recommendation, levels of evidence and Task Force agreement are provided, both mostly very high. These recommendations intend informing rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies, hospital officials, social security agencies and regulators about EULAR's most recent consensus on the management of RA, aimed at attaining best outcomes with current therapies.

24161836	In this article, the 2010 European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs and bDMARDs, respectively) have been updated. The 2013 update has been developed by an international task force, which based its decisions mostly on evidence from three systematic literature reviews (one each on sDMARDs, including glucocorticoids, bDMARDs and safety aspects of DMARD therapy); treatment strategies were also covered by the searches. The evidence presented was discussed and summarised by the experts in the course of a consensus finding and voting process. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendations were derived and levels of agreement (strengths of recommendations) were determined. Fourteen recommendations were developed (instead of 15 in 2010). Some of the 2010 recommendations were deleted, and others were amended or split. The recommendations cover general aspects, such as attainment of remission or low disease activity using a treat-to-target approach, and the need for shared decision-making between rheumatologists and patients. The more specific items relate to starting DMARD therapy using a conventional sDMARD (csDMARD) strategy in combination with glucocorticoids, followed by the addition of a bDMARD or another csDMARD strategy (after stratification by presence or absence of adverse risk factors) if the treatment target is not reached within 6 months (or improvement not seen at 3 months). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, biosimilars), abatacept, tocilizumab and, under certain circumstances, rituximab are essentially considered to have similar efficacy and safety. If the first bDMARD strategy fails, any other bDMARD may be used. The recommendations also address tofacitinib as a targeted sDMARD (tsDMARD), which is recommended, where licensed, after use of at least one bDMARD. Biosimilars are also addressed. These recommendations are intended to inform rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies and other stakeholders about EULAR's most recent consensus on the management of RA with sDMARDs, glucocorticoids and bDMARDs. They are based on evidence and expert opinion and intended to improve outcome in patients with RA.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Rituximab		1
10979111	Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown. To determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. The Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. Three hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted. Incidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period. For all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use. In this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Aspirin		0
12835414	Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is a potent mediator of pain and inflammation, and high levels of this lipid mediator are observed in numerous disease states. The inhibition of PGE2 production to control pain and to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis to date has depended on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as aspirin. However, these agents inhibit the synthesis of all prostanoids. To produce biologically active PGE2, PGE synthases catalyze the isomerization of PGH2 into PGE2. Recently, several PGE synthases have been identified and cloned, but their role in inflammation is not clear. To study the physiological role of the individual PGE synthases, we have generated by targeted homologous recombination a mouse line deficient in microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) on the inbred DBA/1lacJ background. mPGES1-deficient (mPGES1-/-) mice are viable and fertile and develop normally compared with wild-type controls. However, mPGES1-/- mice displayed a marked reduction in inflammatory responses compared with mPGES1+/+ mice in multiple assays. Here, we identify mPGES1 as the PGE synthase that contributes to the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis, a disease model of human rheumatoid arthritis. We also show that mPGES1 is responsible for the production of PGE2 that mediates acute pain during an inflammatory response. These findings suggest that mPGES1 provides a target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain associated with inflammatory states.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Aspirin		1
9751091	To investigate the efficacy and safety of SC-58635 (celecoxib), an antiinflammatory and analgesic agent that acts by selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition and is not expected to cause the typical gastrointestinal (GI), renal, and platelet-related side effects associated with inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme. Four phase II trials were performed: a 2-week osteoarthritis efficacy trial, a 4-week rheumatoid arthritis efficacy trial, a 1-week endoscopic study of GI mucosal effects, and a 1-week study of effects on platelet function. The 2 arthritis trials identified SC-58635 dosage levels that were consistently effective in treating the signs and symptoms of arthritis and were distinguished from placebo on standard arthritis scales. In the upper GI endoscopy study, 19% of subjects receiving naproxen (6 of 32) developed gastric ulcers, whereas no ulcers occurred in subjects receiving SC-58635 or placebo. The study of platelet effects revealed no meaningful effect of SC-58635 on platelet aggregation or thromboxane B2 levels, whereas aspirin caused significant decreases in 2 of 3 platelet aggregation measures and thromboxane B2 levels. In all 4 trials, SC-58635 was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. SC-58635 achieves analgesic and antiinflammatory efficacy in arthritis through selective COX-2 inhibition, without showing any evidence of 2 of the toxic effects of COX-1 inhibition associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

8618582	Acid suppression with famotidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, provides protection against gastric injury in normal subjects receiving short courses of aspirin or naproxen. The efficacy of famotidine in preventing peptic ulcers in patients receiving long-term therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is not known. We studied the efficacy of two doses of famotidine (20 mg and 40 mg, each given orally twice daily), as compared with placebo, in preventing peptic ulcers in 285 patients without peptic ulcers who were receiving long-term NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (82 percent) or osteoarthritis (18 percent). The patients were evaluated clinically and by endoscopy at base line and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. The evaluators were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of gastric or duodenal ulceration at 24 weeks. The cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers was 20 percent in the placebo group, 13 percent in the group of patients receiving 20 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.24 for the comparison with placebo), and 8 percent in the group receiving 40 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.03 for the comparison with placebo). The proportion of patients in whom duodenal ulcers developed was significantly lower with both doses of famotidine than with placebo (13 percent in the placebo group, 4 percent in the low-dose famotidine group [P = 0.04], and 2 percent in the high-dose famotidine group [P = 0.01]). Both doses of famotidine were well tolerated. Treatment with high-dose famotidine significantly reduces the cumulative incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients with arthritis receiving long-term NSAID therapy.

21870978	Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin. In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P<0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P=0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P<0.001), and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P=0.42). In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality.

11519503	Despite current treatments, patients who have acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation have high rates of major vascular events. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel when given with aspirin in such patients. We randomly assigned 12,562 patients who had presented within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms to receive clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, followed by 75 mg once daily) (6259 patients) or placebo (6303 patients) in addition to aspirin for 3 to 12 months. The first primary outcome--a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--occurred in 9.3 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 11.4 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk with clopidogrel as compared with placebo, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). The second primary outcome--the first primary outcome or refractory ischemia--occurred in 16.5 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 18.8 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94; P<0.001). The percentages of patients with in-hospital refractory or severe ischemia, heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also significantly lower with clopidogrel. There were significantly more patients with major bleeding in the clopidogrel group than in the placebo group (3.7 percent vs. 2.7 percent; relative risk, 1.38; P=0.001), but there were not significantly more patients with episodes of life-threatening bleeding (2.2 percent [corrected] vs. 1.8 percent; P=0.13) or hemorrhagic strokes (0.1 percent vs. 0.1 percent). The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has beneficial effects in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. However, the risk of major bleeding is increased among patients treated with clopidogrel.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
11786451	To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events. Collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews). Randomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen. 287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens. "Serious vascular event": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. Overall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000. Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
8918275	Many clinical trials have evaluated the benefit of long-term use of antiplatelet drugs in reducing the risk of clinical thrombotic events. Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have potentially serious adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate. CAPRIE was a randomised, blinded, international trial designed to assess the relative efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome cluster of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; their relative safety was also assessed. The population studied comprised subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease manifested as either recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years. 19,185 patients, with more than 6300 in each of the clinical subgroups, were recruited over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1.91 years. There were 1960 first events included in the outcome cluster on which an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with clopidogrel had an annual 5.32% risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5.83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statistically significant (p = 0.043) relative-risk reduction of 8.7% in favour of clopidogrel (95% Cl 0.3-16.5). Corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative-risk reduction of 9.4%. There were no major differences in terms of safety. Reported adverse experiences in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups judged to be severe included rash (0.26% vs 0.10%), diarrhoea (0.23% vs 0.11%), upper gastrointestinal discomfort (0.97% vs 1.22%), intracranial haemorrhage (0.33% vs 0.47%), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0.52% vs 0.72%), respectively. There were ten (0.10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with significant reductions in neutrophils (< 1.2 x 10(9)/L) and 16 (0.17%) in the aspirin group. Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The overall safety profile of clopidogrel is at least as good as that of medium-dose aspirin.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
12114036	Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.	Stroke		Simvastatin		1
26039521	Statin therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events, but whether the addition of ezetimibe, a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can reduce the rate of cardiovascular events further is not known. We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial involving 18,144 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) if they were receiving lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if they were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 6 years. The median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary end point at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.016). Rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. When added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provided additional benefit. (Funded by Merck; IMPROVE-IT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00202878.).	Stroke		Simvastatin		1
12814710	Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although typically their plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol are similar to those in the general population. Previous evidence about the effects of lowering cholesterol in people with diabetes has been limited, and most diabetic patients do not currently receive cholesterol-lowering therapy despite their increased risk. 5963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) known to have diabetes, and an additional 14573 with occlusive arterial disease (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Prespecified analyses in these prior disease subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, were of first major coronary event (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and of first major vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke or revascularisation). Analyses were also conducted of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, intention to treat), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Both among the participants who presented with diabetes and among those who did not, there were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for major coronary events, for strokes, and for revascularisations. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%] placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40, p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period. The present study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.

22085343	In patients with established cardiovascular disease, residual cardiovascular risk persists despite the achievement of target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with statin therapy. It is unclear whether extended-release niacin added to simvastatin to raise low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is superior to simvastatin alone in reducing such residual risk. We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive extended-release niacin, 1500 to 2000 mg per day, or matching placebo. All patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe, 10 mg per day, if needed, to maintain an LDL cholesterol level of 40 to 80 mg per deciliter (1.03 to 2.07 mmol per liter). The primary end point was the first event of the composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome, or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization. A total of 3414 patients were randomly assigned to receive niacin (1718) or placebo (1696). The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. At 2 years, niacin therapy had significantly increased the median HDL cholesterol level from 35 mg per deciliter (0.91 mmol per liter) to 42 mg per deciliter (1.08 mmol per liter), lowered the triglyceride level from 164 mg per deciliter (1.85 mmol per liter) to 122 mg per deciliter (1.38 mmol per liter), and lowered the LDL cholesterol level from 74 mg per deciliter (1.91 mmol per liter) to 62 mg per deciliter (1.60 mmol per liter). The primary end point occurred in 282 patients in the niacin group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the placebo group (16.2%) (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.21; P=0.79 by the log-rank test). Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.81 mmol per liter), there was no incremental clinical benefit from the addition of niacin to statin therapy during a 36-month follow-up period, despite significant improvements in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

12814710	Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although typically their plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol are similar to those in the general population. Previous evidence about the effects of lowering cholesterol in people with diabetes has been limited, and most diabetic patients do not currently receive cholesterol-lowering therapy despite their increased risk. 5963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) known to have diabetes, and an additional 14573 with occlusive arterial disease (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Prespecified analyses in these prior disease subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, were of first major coronary event (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and of first major vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke or revascularisation). Analyses were also conducted of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, intention to treat), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Both among the participants who presented with diabetes and among those who did not, there were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for major coronary events, for strokes, and for revascularisations. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%] placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40, p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period. The present study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.

15016485	Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed. 3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first "major vascular event" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, "intention-to-treat"), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.

11815421	Previous studies have demonstrated that experimental hypercholesterolemia leads to neovascularization in the coronary artery vasa vasorum (VV). Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have beneficial effects independent of lipid lowering. We aimed to determine the effect of simvastatin on coronary VV neovascularization, in the absence of cholesterol lowering. Pigs were randomized to 3 groups fed a normal (N), high cholesterol (HC), or HC+simvastatin (HC+S) diet for 12 weeks. The proximal left anterior descending artery was isolated, scanned with micro-CT, and reconstructed. Quantification of the VV density in serial cross-sections along the vessel was then performed. LDL cholesterol was similarly increased in HC and HC+S compared with N. There was an increase in both VV density (4.7+/-0.3 versus 2.7+/-0.2 n/mm(2); P<0.05) and vessel wall area (3.1+/-0.2 versus 1.8+/-0.1 mm(2); P<0.05) in HC compared with N. The VV density in HC+S was preserved compared with HC (3.0+/-0.2 n/mm(2); P<0.05), despite similar increase in vessel wall area compared with N (2.5+/-0.1 mm(2); P<0.05). Coronary artery tissue expression of VEGF was increased in HC but not in HC+S compared with N. In parallel, immunoreactivity for HIF-1alpha, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was accentuated in the outer media in HC but not in HC+S compared with N. This study demonstrates that simvastatin attenuates hypoxia in the coronary artery wall and VV neovascularization in experimental hypercholesterolemia, despite no change in plasma lipids. These data are consistent with an additional mechanism for the vascular effects of the statins, independent of cholesterol lowering.	High Cholesterol		Simvastatin		0
11382730	Simvastatin attenuates ischemia and reperfusion in normocholesterolemic animals by stabilizing endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and inhibiting neutrophil-mediated injury. Because endothelial dysfunction is a detrimental effect of hypercholesterolemia, we examined whether short-term treatment with simvastatin could inhibit leukocyte-endothelium interaction and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. We studied leukocyte-endothelium interactions in apoE(-/-) mice fed a normal or a high-cholesterol diet after short-term (ie, 18 hours) simvastatin treatment. We also studied simvastatin treatment in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by subjecting apoE(-/-) mice to 30 minutes of ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet exhibited higher blood cholesterol levels, which were not affected by short-term simvastatin treatment. However, the increased leukocyte rolling and adherence that occurred in cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice (P<0.001 versus control diet) were significantly attenuated by simvastatin treatment (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion also experienced increased myocardial necrosis (P<0.01 versus control diet), which was significantly attenuated by simvastatin (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Simvastatin therapy also significantly increased vascular nitric oxide production in apoE(-/-) mice. Simvastatin attenuates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and ameliorates ischemic injury in hypercholesterolemic mice independently of lipid-lowering actions.	High Cholesterol		Simvastatin		0
9880379	From a physiological perspective, physical activity might be expected to decrease the risk of developing stroke. However, epidemiological studies of physical activity and stroke risk have yielded divergent findings. We therefore sought to examine the association between exercise and stroke risk. This was a prospective cohort study of 21 823 men, followed up for an average of 11.1 years. Participants were from the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene. Men, aged 40 to 84 years at baseline, were free of self-reported myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cancer. At baseline, they reported on the frequency of exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat. Stroke occurrence was reported by participants and confirmed after medical record review (n=533). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the data. With adjustment for age, treatment assignment, smoking, alcohol intake, history of angina, and parental history of myocardial infarction, the relative risks of total stroke associated with vigorous exercise <1 time, 1 time, 2 to 4 times, and >/=5 times per week at baseline were 1.00 (referent), 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1. 03), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.03), respectively; P for trend=0.04. In subgroup analyses, the inverse association appeared stronger with hemorrhagic than ischemic stroke. When we additionally adjusted for body mass index, history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus, corresponding relative risks for total stroke were 1.00 (referent), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.07), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.10), and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.13), respectively; P for trend=0.25. Exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat is associated with decreased stroke risk in men. In the present study, the inverse association with physical activity appeared to be mediated through beneficial effects on body weight, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and glucose tolerance. Apart from its favorable influences on these variables, physical activity had no significant residual association with stroke incidence.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
11182189	Beneficial effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular events may depend, at least in part, on their anti-inflammatory action. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of simvastatin and aspirin on serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in hypercholesterolemic subjects. In 33 asymptomatic men with total cholesterol (TC) >6.5 mmol l(-1) and in 25 men with coronary heart disease and borderline-high cholesterol levels (between 5.2 and 6.5 mmol l(-1)) chronically treated with low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d), serum levels of CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 were determined before and after a 3-month simvastatin therapy (20-40 mg daily). In the former group, these markers of inflammation were also measured before and after a 2-week treatment with aspirin (300 mg/d), implemented prior to and in combination with simvastatin. A distinct reduction of CRP and TNF-alpha was found in both groups; IL-6 levels were decreased only in subjects with marked hypercholesterolemia. Aspirin had no effect on the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin. In men with hypercholesterolemia simvastatin treatment lowers serum levels of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines. Low-dose aspirin does not add to the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
11171873	Previous studies of diet and coronary heart disease (CHD) have focused on intake of nutrients rather than whole foods. Because of the findings that dietary fibre, folate and antioxidants may be protective for CHD, increased intake of vegetables has been recommended. However, due to the chemical and physical complexity of vegetables, the effects of individual nutrients may differ if eaten as whole foods. Moreover, little is known about the direct association between vegetable intake and risk of CHD. We prospectively evaluated the relation between vegetable intake and CHD risk in the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of aspirin and beta-carotene among 22 071 US male physicians aged 40-84 years in 1982. In this analysis, we included 15 220 men without heart disease, stroke or cancer at baseline who provided information on their vegetable intake at baseline, and in the 2nd, 4th and 6th years of follow-up using a simple semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire including eight vegetables. We confirmed 1148 incident cases of CHD (387 incident cases of myocardial infarction and 761 incident cases of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) during 12 years of follow-up. After adjusting for age, randomized treatment, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, history of high cholesterol, and use of multivitamins, men who consumed at least 2.5 servings/day of vegetables had a relative risk (RR) of 0.77 (95% CI : 0.60-0.98) for CHD, compared with men in the lowest category (<1 serving/day). Adjusting for the same covariates in an analysis of the overall trend that considered intake of vegetables as a continuous variable, we found a RR of 0.83 (95% CI : 0.71-0.98) for risk of CHD for each additional serving/day of vegetables. The inverse relation between vegetable intake and CHD risk was more evident among men with a BMI > or =25 (RR = 0.71, 95% CI : 0.51-0.99) or current smokers (RR = 0.40, 95% CI : 0.18-0.86) comparing highest to the lowest categories of intake. Our results suggest an inverse association between vegetable intake and risk of CHD. These prospective data support current dietary guidelines to increase vegetable intake for the prevention of CHD.

15897342	Homeless people represent an extremely disadvantaged group in North America. Among older homeless men, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death. The objective of this study was to examine cardiovascular risk factors in a representative sample of homeless adults and identify opportunities for improved risk factor modification. Homeless persons were randomly selected at shelters for single adults in Toronto. Response rate was 79%. Participants (n=202) underwent interviews, physical measurements, and blood sampling. The mean age of participants was 42 years, and 89% were men. The prevalence of smoking among homeless subjects (78%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72% to 84%) was significantly higher than in the general population (standardized morbidity ratio [SMR], 254; 95% CI, 216 to 297). Hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes were not more prevalent than in the general population but were often poorly controlled. Homeless men were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than men in the general population (SMR, 79; 95% CI, 63 to 98). Cocaine use in the last year was reported by 29% of subjects (95% CI, 23% to 36%). CVD was reported by 15% of subjects, fewer than one third of whom reported taking aspirin or cholesterol-lowering medication. According to multiple-risk-factor equations, the median estimated 10-year absolute risk of myocardial infarction or coronary death among homeless men aged 30 to 74 years was 5% (interquartile range, 3% to 9%). Cardiovascular risk factor modification is suboptimal among homeless adults in Toronto, despite universal health insurance. Multiple risk factor equations may underestimate true risk in this population because of inadequate accounting for factors such as cocaine use and heavy smoking.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
21128814	Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring. We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study that compared oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study. The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.04; P<0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%], vs. 42 with placebo [7.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001). Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P=0.11). Rivaroxaban offers a simple, single-drug approach to the short-term and continued treatment of venous thrombosis that may improve the benefit-to-risk profile of anticoagulation.

23991658	Whether the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban can be an alternative to warfarin in patients with venous thromboembolism is unclear. In a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study, we randomly assigned patients with acute venous thromboembolism, who had initially received heparin, to receive edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg once daily, or 30 mg once daily (e.g., in the case of patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 ml per minute or a body weight below 60 kg), or to receive warfarin. Patients received the study drug for 3 to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. A total of 4921 patients presented with deep-vein thrombosis, and 3319 with a pulmonary embolism. Among patients receiving warfarin, the time in the therapeutic range was 63.5%. Edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to the primary efficacy outcome, which occurred in 130 patients in the edoxaban group (3.2%) and 146 patients in the warfarin group (3.5%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.13; P<0.001 for noninferiority). The safety outcome occurred in 349 patients (8.5%) in the edoxaban group and 423 patients (10.3%) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.94; P=0.004 for superiority). The rates of other adverse events were similar in the two groups. A total of 938 patients with pulmonary embolism had right ventricular dysfunction, as assessed by measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels; the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism in this subgroup was 3.3% in the edoxaban group and 6.2% in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.98). Edoxaban administered once daily after initial treatment with heparin was noninferior to high-quality standard therapy and caused significantly less bleeding in a broad spectrum of patients with venous thromboembolism, including those with severe pulmonary embolism.

8594425	Patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis are usually treated first in the hospital with intravenous standard (unfractionated) heparin. However, the longer plasma half-life, better bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, and more predictable anticoagulant response of low-molecular-weight heparins make them attractive for possible home use. We compared these two approaches. Patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous standard heparin in the hospital (253 patients) or low-molecular-weight heparin (1 mg of enoxaparin per kilogram of body weight subcutaneously twice daily) administered primarily at home (247 patients). The study design allowed outpatients taking low-molecular-weight heparin to go home immediately and hospitalized patients taking low-molecular-weight heparin to be discharged early. All the patients received warfarin starting on the second day. Thirteen of the 247 patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin (5.3 percent) had recurrent thromboembolism, as compared with 17 of the 253 patients receiving standard heparin (6.7 percent; P=0.57; absolute difference, 1.4 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval, -3.0 to 5.7). Five patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin had major bleeding, as compared with three patients receiving standard heparin. After randomization, the patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin spent a mean of 1.1 days in the hospital, as compared with 6.5 days for the standard-heparin group; 120 patients in the low-molecular-weight- heparin group did not need to be hospitalized at all. Low-molecular-weight heparin can be used safely and effectively to treat patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis at home.	Deep Vein Thrombosis		Warfarin		0
15758007	Prophylaxis against deep-vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients remains underused. We hypothesized that the use of a computer-alert program to encourage prophylaxis might reduce the frequency of deep-vein thrombosis among high-risk hospitalized patients. We developed a computer program linked to the patient database to identify consecutive hospitalized patients at risk for deep-vein thrombosis in the absence of prophylaxis. The program used medical-record numbers to randomly assign 1255 eligible patients to an intervention group, in which the responsible physician was alerted to a patient's risk of deep-vein thrombosis, and 1251 patients to a control group, in which no alert was issued. The physician was required to acknowledge the alert and could then withhold or order prophylaxis, including graduated compression stockings, pneumatic compression boots, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or warfarin. The primary end point was clinically diagnosed, objectively confirmed deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days. More patients in the intervention group than in the control group received mechanical prophylaxis (10.0 percent vs. 1.5 percent, P<0.001) or pharmacologic prophylaxis (23.6 percent vs. 13.0 percent, P<0.001). The primary end point occurred in 61 patients (4.9 percent) in the intervention group, as compared with 103 (8.2 percent) in the control group; the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the likelihood of freedom from deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days were 94.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 92.5 to 95.4 percent) and 90.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88.7 to 92.2 percent), respectively (P<0.001). The computer alert reduced the risk of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days by 41 percent (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81; P=0.001). The institution of a computer-alert program increased physicians' use of prophylaxis and markedly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients at risk.

28902590	Whether closure of a patent foramen ovale reduces the risk of recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients who have had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke is unknown. In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with blinded adjudication of end-point events, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 60 years of age who had a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke to undergo closure of the PFO (PFO closure group) or to receive medical therapy alone (aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin combined with extended-release dipyridamole; medical-therapy group). The primary efficacy end point was a composite of recurrent nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal ischemic stroke, or early death after randomization. The results of the analysis of the primary outcome from the original trial period have been reported previously; the current analysis of data from the extended follow-up period was considered to be exploratory. We enrolled 980 patients (mean age, 45.9 years) at 69 sites. Patients were followed for a median of 5.9 years. Treatment exposure in the two groups was unequal (3141 patient-years in the PFO closure group vs. 2669 patient-years in the medical-therapy group), owing to a higher dropout rate in the medical-therapy group. In the intention-to-treat population, recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 18 patients in the PFO closure group and in 28 patients in the medical-therapy group, resulting in rates of 0.58 events per 100 patient-years and 1.07 events per 100 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio with PFO closure vs. medical therapy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.999; P=0.046 by the log-rank test). Recurrent ischemic stroke of undetermined cause occurred in 10 patients in the PFO closure group and in 23 patients in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.79; P=0.007). Venous thromboembolism (which comprised events of pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis) was more common in the PFO closure group than in the medical-therapy group. Among adults who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke, closure of a PFO was associated with a lower rate of recurrent ischemic strokes than medical therapy alone during extended follow-up.

17337887	Individuals with transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke have a high risk of recurrent stroke and death. While acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is proven and accepted as standard therapy in these patients, recent trials demonstrate that a combination of ASA and dipyridamole (DP) or clopidogrel may be superior to ASA. Blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may also reduce recurrent stroke. The ongoing PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes) trial is designed to evaluate whether ASA + extended-release DP compared to clopidogrel, and whether telmisartan in addition to usual care in individuals after a stroke, will reduce the risk of further strokes. PRoFESS is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involving 695 sites from 35 countries or regions. Patients > or = 50 years presenting with an ischemic stroke < 120 days who were stable were randomized. The primary outcome for the trial is recurrent stroke, using a time-to-event analysis. The most important secondary outcome is the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. Other secondary outcomes include this composite + congestive heart failure, new-onset diabetes, other designated occlusive vascular events (pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion, transient ischemic attack, cerebral venous thrombosis or retinal vascular accident not classified as stroke), any death, stroke subtype by TOAST criteria and Mini Mental State Examination score. Safety is evaluated by assessing the risk of major hemorrhagic events. The comparison between ASA + DP and clopidogrel is based on an initial assessment of noninferiority, followed by evaluation of superiority, while for telmisartan, we will assess its superiority over placebo. With over 20,000 patients randomized, and utilizing a 2 x 2 factorial design, PRoFESS is the largest stroke trial to investigate the prevention of recurrent stroke. The mean age was 66.1 +/- 8.6 years, and 36.0% of the patients were females. The median time from qualifying event to randomization was 15 days with 39.9% of patients randomized within 10 days. According to the TOAST criteria, 28.5% of the strokes were due to large-vessel disease, 52.1% to small-vessel disease, 1.8% to cardioembolism, and 2.0% to other determined etiologies and 15.5% were of undetermined etiology. PRoFESS is the largest secondary stroke prevention trial to date and will directly compare two antiplatelet regimens as well as the benefit of telmisartan versus placebo.

22441640	Risk for bleeding complications during and after early hip fracture surgery for patients taking clopidogrel and other anticoagulants have not been defined. The purpose of this study is to assess the perioperative bleeding risks and clinical outcome after early hip fracture surgery performed on patients taking clopidogrel (Plavix) and other oral anticoagulants. Study design is a retrospective cohort analysis using data extracted from hospital records and state death records. Regional medical center (level II trauma). Data for 1118 patients ≥60 years of age who had surgical treatment for a hip fracture between 2004 and 2008 were reviewed. Eighty-two patients undergoing late surgery (>3 days after admission) were excluded. Patients taking clopidogrel were compared against those not taking clopidogrel. In addition, patients taking clopidogrel only were compared against cohorts of patients taking both clopidogrel and aspirin, aspirin only, warfarin only, or no anticoagulant. Seventy-four of 1036 patients (7%) were taking clopidogrel, although control groups included 253 patients on aspirin alone, 90 patients on warfarin, and 619 taking no anticoagulants. No significant differences were noted between patients taking clopidogrel and those not taking clopidogrel in estimated blood loss, transfusion requirement, final blood count, hematoma evacuation, hospital length of stay (LOS), or mortality while in hospital or at 1 year. A higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score was seen in the clopidogrel and warfarin groups (P = 0.05 each), increased LOS in the clopidogrel group (P = 0.05), and higher rate of deep vein thrombosis seen in those patients taking warfarin (P = 0.05). Clopidogrel only versus aspirin versus both aspirin and clopidogrel, versus no anticoagulant versus warfarin showed no significant differences in estimated blood loss, transfusion requirement, final blood count, bleeding or perioperative complications, or mortality. Patients undergoing early hip fracture surgery who are taking clopidogrel, aspirin, or warfarin (with regulated international normalized ratio) are not at substantially increased risk for bleeding, bleeding complications, or mortality. Comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores were significantly higher in the clopidogrel group, which may have resulted in the increased postoperative LOS in this group.

19838770	Several newer anticoagulants are under clinical development. Recently two of them, Dabigatran etexilate/Pradaxa. and Rivaroxaban/Xarelto obtained marketing authorization in Europe and Canada for the prevention of thromboembolic events following major orthopedic surgery such as total hip and knee replacement. The results of Phase III clinical studies in thromboprophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery are highlighted and discussed in detail. Ongoing Phase II and III clinical trials assess their efficacy in the secondary prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and in the long-term prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Many other small antithrombotic molecules including a new generation of low molecular weight heparins, are currently in different stages of clinical development. In addition to being administered orally, the newer anticoagulant agents have a more balanced benefit/risk ratio and wider therapeutic window. They have a rapid onset of action, a predictable anticoagulant effect that does not require routine laboratory monitoring. They have minor food and drug interactions, including those with cytochrome P450 and P.gp. They are highly specific and targeted to a single coagulation factor, and could carry similar or less hemorrhagic risks compared to the older anticoagulant agents. Finally, they may be used in a broader variety of patients, especially the medically ill patients with advanced cancer, and the elderly without any dosage adjustment, regardless of the patient age, gender, body weight, or in patients with mild renal impairment. Their use in the general world will hopefully confirm the promising results of clinical trials.	Deep Vein Thrombosis		Clopidogrel		0
15743917	Allopurinol, a commonly prescribed medication for gout and hyperuricemia, is a frequent cause of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), which include the drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The adverse events are unpredictable and carry significant morbidity and mortality. To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-SCAR, we carried out a case-control association study. We enrolled 51 patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 control individuals (135 allopurinol-tolerant subjects and 93 healthy subjects from the general population), and genotyped for 823 SNPs in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. The initial screen revealed strong association between allopurinol-SCAR and SNPs in the MHC region, including BAT3 (encoding HLA-B associated transcript 3), MSH5 (mutS homolog 5), and MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B) (P < 10(-7)). We then determined the alleles of HLA loci A, B, C, and DRB1. The HLA-B*5801 allele was present in all (100%) 51 patients with allopurinol-SCAR, but only in 20 (15%) of 135 tolerant patients [odds ratio 580.3 (95% confidence interval, 34.4-9780.9); corrected P value = 4.7 x 10(-24)] and in 19 (20%) of 93 of healthy subjects [393.51 (23.23-6665.26); corrected P value = 8.1 x 10(-18)]. HLA alleles A*3303, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301 were in linkage disequilibrium and formed an extended haplotype with HLA-B*5801. Our results indicated that allopurinol-SCAR is strongly associated with a genetic predisposition in Han Chinese. In particular, HLA-B*5801 allele is an important genetic risk factor for this life-threatening condition.	Gout		Allopurinol		1
16707532	To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout. The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales. 12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5-1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended. 12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.	Gout		Allopurinol		1
16339094	Febuxostat, a novel nonpurine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, is a potential alternative to allopurinol for patients with hyperuricemia and gout. We randomly assigned 762 patients with gout and with serum urate concentrations of at least 8.0 mg per deciliter (480 micromol per liter) to receive either febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg) or allopurinol (300 mg) once daily for 52 weeks; 760 received the study drug. Prophylaxis against gout flares with naproxen or colchicine was provided during weeks 1 through 8. The primary end point was a serum urate concentration of less than 6.0 mg per deciliter (360 micromol per liter) at the last three monthly measurements. The secondary end points included reduction in the incidence of gout flares and in tophus area. The primary end point was reached in 53 percent of patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat, 62 percent of those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, and 21 percent of those receiving allopurinol (P<0.001 for the comparison of each febuxostat group with the allopurinol group). Although the incidence of gout flares diminished with continued treatment, the overall incidence during weeks 9 through 52 was similar in all groups: 64 percent of patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat, 70 percent of those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, and 64 percent of those receiving allopurinol (P=0.99 for 80 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol; P=0.23 for 120 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol). The median reduction in tophus area was 83 percent in patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat and 66 percent in those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, as compared with 50 percent in those receiving allopurinol (P=0.08 for 80 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol; P=0.16 for 120 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol). More patients in the high-dose febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (P=0.003) or the low-dose febuxostat group discontinued the study. Four of the 507 patients in the two febuxostat groups (0.8 percent) and none of the 253 patients in the allopurinol group died; all deaths were from causes that the investigators (while still blinded to treatment) judged to be unrelated to the study drugs (P=0.31 for the comparison between the combined febuxostat groups and the allopurinol group). Febuxostat, at a daily dose of 80 mg or 120 mg, was more effective than allopurinol at the commonly used fixed daily dose of 300 mg in lowering serum urate. Similar reductions in gout flares and tophus area occurred in all treatment groups.	Gout		Allopurinol		1
16507884	The prototypical xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor allopurinol, has been the cornerstone of the clinical management of gout and conditions associated with hyperuricemia for several decades. More recent data indicate that XO also plays an important role in various forms of ischemic and other types of tissue and vascular injuries, inflammatory diseases, and chronic heart failure. Allopurinol and its active metabolite oxypurinol showed considerable promise in the treatment of these conditions both in experimental animals and in small-scale human clinical trials. Although some of the beneficial effects of these compounds may be unrelated to the inhibition of the XO, the encouraging findings rekindled significant interest in the development of additional, novel series of XO inhibitors for various therapeutic indications. Here we present a critical overview of the effects of XO inhibitors in various pathophysiological conditions and also review the various emerging therapeutic strategies offered by this approach.

15457467	To assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in subjects with primary fibromyalgia, with or without current major depressive disorder. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 18 outpatient research centers in the US. A total of 207 subjects meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for primary fibromyalgia were enrolled (89% female, 87% white, mean age 49 years, 38% with current major depressive disorder). After single-blind placebo treatment for 1 week, subjects were randomly assigned to receive duloxetine 60 mg twice a day (n = 104) or placebo (n = 103) for 12 weeks. Co-primary outcome measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score (score range 0-80, with 0 indicating no impact) and FIQ pain score (score range 0-10). Secondary outcome measures included mean tender point pain threshold, number of tender points, FIQ fatigue, tiredness on awakening, and stiffness scores, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) scale, Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) scale, Brief Pain Inventory (short form), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Quality of Life in Depression Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale. Compared with placebo-treated subjects, duloxetine-treated subjects improved significantly more (P = 0.027) on the FIQ total score, with a treatment difference of -5.53 (95% confidence interval -10.43, -0.63), but not significantly more on the FIQ pain score (P = 0.130). Compared with placebo-treated subjects, duloxetine-treated subjects had significantly greater reductions in Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score (P = 0.008), Brief Pain Inventory average interference from pain score (P = 0.004), number of tender points (P = 0.002), and FIQ stiffness score (P = 0.048), and had significantly greater improvement in mean tender point pain threshold (P = 0.002), CGI-Severity (P = 0.048), PGI-Improvement (P = 0.033), and several quality-of-life measures. Duloxetine treatment improved fibromyalgia symptoms and pain severity regardless of baseline status of major depressive disorder. Compared with placebo-treated female subjects (n = 92), duloxetine-treated female subjects (n = 92) demonstrated significantly greater improvement on most efficacy measures, while duloxetine-treated male subjects (n = 12) failed to improve significantly on any efficacy measure. The treatment effect on significant pain reduction in female subjects was independent of the effect on mood or anxiety. Duloxetine was safely administered and well tolerated. In this randomized, controlled, 12-week trial (with a 1-week placebo lead-in phase), duloxetine was an effective and safe treatment for many of the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia in subjects with or without major depressive disorder, particularly for women, who had significant improvement across most outcome measures.

16298061	This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in 354 female patients with primary fibromyalgia, with or without current major depressive disorder. Patients (90% Caucasian; mean age, 49.6 years; 26% with current major depressive disorder) received duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD) (N=118), duloxetine 60 mg twice daily (BID) (N=116), or placebo (N=120). The primary outcome was the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score. Response to treatment was defined as >or=30% reduction in this score. Compared with placebo, both duloxetine-treated groups improved significantly more (P<0.001) on the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score. A significantly higher percentage of duloxetine-treated patients had a decrease of >or=30% in this score (duloxetine 60 mg QD (55%; P<0.001); duloxetine 60 mg BID (54%; P=0.002); placebo (33%)). The treatment effect of duloxetine on pain reduction was independent of the effect on mood and the presence of major depressive disorder. Compared with patients on placebo, patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg QD or duloxetine 60 mg BID had significantly greater improvement in remaining Brief Pain Inventory pain severity and interference scores, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression of Severity, Patient Global Impression of Improvement, and several quality-of-life measures. Both doses of duloxetine were safely administered and well tolerated. In conclusion, both duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID were effective and safe in the treatment of fibromyalgia in female patients with or without major depressive disorder.

18395345	The primary objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine for reducing pain severity in fibromyalgia patients with or without current major depressive disorder. This was a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In total, 520 patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to duloxetine (20 mg/day, 60 mg/day, or 120 mg/day) or placebo, administered once daily, for 6 months (after 3 months, the duloxetine 20-mg/day group titrated to 60 mg/day). The co-primary outcome measures were the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain severity score and Patient Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Safety was assessed via treatment-emergent adverse events, and changes in vital sign, laboratory, and ECG measures. Compared with placebo-treated patients, those patients treated with duloxetine 120 mg/day improved significantly more on the co-primary outcome measures at 3 months (change in BPI score [-2.31 vs -1.39, P<0.001] and PGI-I [2.89 vs 3.39, P=0.004]) and at 6 months (change in BPI [-2.26 vs -1.43, P=0.003] and PGI-I [2.93 vs 3.37, P=0.012]). Compared with placebo, treatment with duloxetine 60 mg/day also significantly improved the co-primary measures at 3 months and BPI at 6 months. Duloxetine was efficacious in patients both with and without major depressive disorder. There were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups in changes in vital signs, laboratory measures, or ECG measures. Study results demonstrated that duloxetine at doses of 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day appears to be safe and efficacious in patients with fibromyalgia.	Fibromyalgia		Duloxetine		1
24385423	Duloxetine is a balanced serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor licensed for the treatment of major depressive disorders, urinary stress incontinence and the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A number of trials have been conducted to investigate the use of duloxetine in neuropathic and nociceptive painful conditions. This is the first update of a review first published in 2010. To assess the benefits and harms of duloxetine for treating painful neuropathy and different types of chronic pain. On 19th November 2013, we searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, DARE, HTA, NHSEED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials in April 2013. We also searched the reference lists of identified publications for trials of duloxetine for the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathy or chronic pain. We selected all randomised or quasi-randomised trials of any formulation of duloxetine, used for the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathy or chronic pain in adults. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We identified 18 trials, which included 6407 participants. We found 12 of these studies in the literature search for this update. Eight studies included a total of 2728 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy and six studies involved 2249 participants with fibromyalgia. Three studies included participants with depression and painful physical symptoms and one included participants with central neuropathic pain. Studies were mostly at low risk of bias, although significant drop outs, imputation methods and almost every study being performed or sponsored by the drug manufacturer add to the risk of bias in some domains. Duloxetine at 60 mg daily is effective in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the short term, with a risk ratio (RR) for ≥ 50% pain reduction at 12 weeks of 1.73 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.08). The related NNTB is 5 (95% CI 4 to 7). Duloxetine at 60 mg daily is also effective for fibromyalgia over 12 weeks (RR for ≥ 50% reduction in pain 1.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.06; NNTB 8, 95% CI 4 to 21) and over 28 weeks (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.27) as well as for painful physical symptoms in depression (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 14). There was no effect on central neuropathic pain in a single, small, high quality trial. In all conditions, adverse events were common in both treatment and placebo arms but more common in the treatment arm, with a dose-dependent effect. Most adverse effects were minor, but 16% of participants stopped the drug due to adverse effects. Serious adverse events were rare. There is adequate amounts of moderate quality evidence from eight studies performed by the manufacturers of duloxetine that doses of 60 mg and 120 mg daily are efficacious for treating pain in diabetic peripheral neuropathy but lower daily doses are not. Further trials are not required. In fibromyalgia, there is lower quality evidence that duloxetine is effective at similar doses to those used in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and with a similar magnitude of effect. The effect in fibromyalgia may be achieved through a greater improvement in mental symptoms than in somatic physical pain. There is low to moderate quality evidence that pain relief is also achieved in pain associated with depressive symptoms, but the NNTB of 8 in fibromyalgia and depression is not an indication of substantial efficacy. More trials (preferably independent investigator led studies) in these indications are required to reach an optimal information size to make convincing determinations of efficacy.Minor side effects are common and more common with duloxetine 60 mg and particularly with 120 mg daily, than 20 mg daily, but serious side effects are rare.Improved direct comparisons of duloxetine with other antidepressants and with other drugs, such as pregabalin, that have already been shown to be efficacious in neuropathic pain would be appropriate. Unbiased economic comparisons would further help decision making, but no high quality study includes economic data.	Fibromyalgia		Duloxetine		1
27959717	Peripheral artery disease is considered to be a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis with associated adverse cardiovascular and limb events. Data from previous trials have suggested that patients receiving clopidogrel monotherapy had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those receiving aspirin. We wanted to compare clopidogrel with ticagrelor, a potent antiplatelet agent, in patients with peripheral artery disease. In this double-blind, event-driven trial, we randomly assigned 13,885 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease to receive monotherapy with ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). Patients were eligible if they had an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.80 or less or had undergone previous revascularization of the lower limbs. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary safety end point was major bleeding. The median follow-up was 30 months. The median age of the patients was 66 years, and 72% were men; 43% were enrolled on the basis of the ABI and 57% on the basis of previous revascularization. The mean baseline ABI in all patients was 0.71, 76.6% of the patients had claudication, and 4.6% had critical limb ischemia. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 751 of 6930 patients (10.8%) receiving ticagrelor and in 740 of 6955 (10.6%) receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.13; P=0.65). In each group, acute limb ischemia occurred in 1.7% of the patients (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.33; P=0.85) and major bleeding in 1.6% (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.43; P=0.49). In patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, ticagrelor was not shown to be superior to clopidogrel for the reduction of cardiovascular events. Major bleeding occurred at similar rates among the patients in the two trial groups. (Funded by AstraZeneca; EUCLID ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01732822 .).

16449620	Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately 20% of adults older than 55 years and is a powerful predictor of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death due to vascular causes. The goals of treatment are to prevent future major coronary and cerebrovascular events and improve leg symptoms. To review the best evidence for medical treatment of PAD. MEDLINE and the Cochrane database were searched from 1990 to November 2005 for randomized trials and meta-analyses of medical treatments for PAD. References from these articles were also searched. Search terms included, singly and in combination: peripheral arterial disease, peripheral artery disease, PAD, randomized controlled trial, controlled trial, randomized, and meta-analysis. Particular attention was directed toward randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of clinically relevant medical treatments for PAD. Outcome measures included leg symptoms (intermittent claudication and walking distance), death, and major coronary and cerebrovascular events. Symptoms of leg claudication, walking distance, and quality of life can be improved by smoking cessation (physician advice, nicotine replacement therapy, and bupropion), a structured exercise program, statin drugs, cilostazol, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The risk of major coronary and cerebrovascular events can be reduced through lowering blood pressure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs, use of statin drugs, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel, and probably by stopping smoking. The substantial and increasing burden of PAD, and its local and systemic complications, can be reduced by lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, exercise) and medical therapies (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, antihypertensive drugs, statins, and antiplatelet drugs).

18838564	Incomplete inhibition of platelet thromboxane generation, as measured by elevated urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) concentrations, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. We aimed to determine the external validity of this association in aspirin-treated patients enrolled in the Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial and to determine whether there are any modifiable factors or interventions that lower urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) concentrations that could thereby reduce cardiovascular risk. Urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) concentrations were measured in 3261 aspirin-treated patients at least 1 month after they had been randomly assigned to placebo or clopidogrel. Baseline urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) concentrations in the highest quartile were associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death compared with the lowest quartile (adjusted hazard ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.61, P=0.03). Increasing age, female sex, history of peripheral artery disease, current smoking, and oral hypoglycemic or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy were independently associated with higher urinary concentrations of 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2), whereas aspirin dose > or =150 mg/d, history of treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, history of hypercholesterolemia, and statin treatment were associated with lower concentrations. Randomization to clopidogrel (versus placebo) did not reduce the hazard of cardiovascular events in patients in the highest quartile of urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) levels. In aspirin-treated patients, urinary concentrations of 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) are an externally valid and potentially modifiable determinant of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death in patients at risk for atherothrombotic events.

22315275	This guideline focuses on antithrombotic drug therapies for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as for the relief of lower-extremity symptoms and critical ischemia in persons with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement. The most important of our 20 recommendations are as follows. In patients aged ≥ 50 years with asymptomatic PAD or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, we suggest aspirin (75-100 mg/d) over no therapy (Grade 2B) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. For secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with symptomatic PAD (including patients before and after peripheral arterial bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), we recommend long-term aspirin (75-100 mg/d) or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). We recommend against the use of warfarin plus aspirin in patients with symptomatic PAD (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing peripheral artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting, we suggest single rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 2C). For patients with refractory claudication despite exercise therapy and smoking cessation, we suggest addition of cilostazol (100 mg bid) to aspirin (75-100 mg/d) or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 2C). In patients with critical limb ischemia and rest pain unable to undergo revascularization, we suggest the use of prostanoids (Grade 2C). In patients with acute limb ischemia due to acute thrombosis or embolism, we recommend surgery over peripheral arterial thrombolysis (Grade 1B). Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in most patients with asymptomatic PAD, symptomatic PAD, and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional therapies for relief of limb symptoms should be considered only after exercise therapy, smoking cessation, and evaluation for peripheral artery revascularization.

In patients with acute limb ischemia due to acute thrombosis or embolism, we recommend surgery over peripheral arterial thrombolysis (Grade 1B). Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in most patients with asymptomatic PAD, symptomatic PAD, and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional therapies for relief of limb symptoms should be considered only after exercise therapy, smoking cessation, and evaluation for peripheral artery revascularization.

21324428	Bleeding, a common complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treatment, is associated with worse outcomes. A contemporary model for major bleeding associated with AMI treatment can stratify patients at elevated risk for bleeding and is needed to risk-adjust AMI practice and outcomes. Using the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) database, an in-hospital major bleeding risk model was developed in a population of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The model used only baseline variables and was developed (n = 72,313) and validated (n = 17,960) in patients with AMI (at 251 United States centers from January 2007 to December 2008). The 12 most statistically and clinically significant variables were incorporated into the final regression model. The calibration plots are shown, and the model discrimination is demonstrated in derivation and validation cohorts, as well as across key subgroups. The rate of major bleeding in the overall population was 10.8%. The 12 factors associated with major bleeding in the model were heart rate, baseline hemoglobin, female gender, baseline serum creatinine, age, electrocardiographic changes, heart failure or shock, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, body weight, systolic blood pressure, and home warfarin use. The risk model discriminated well in the derivation (C-statistic = 0.73) and validation (C-statistic = 0.71) cohorts. A risk score for major bleeding corresponded well with observed bleeding: very low risk (3.9%), low risk (7.3%), moderate risk (16.1%), high risk (29.0%), and very high risk (39.8%). In conclusion, the ACTION Registry-GWTG in-hospital major bleeding model stratifies risk for major bleeding using variables at presentation and enables risk-adjusted bleeding outcomes for quality improvement initiatives and clinical decision making.

17635734	The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for the initial and long-term management of acute coronary syndromes but increases the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy is often combined with oral anticoagulants in patients with an indication for warfarin therapy (e.g. atrial fibrillation) who also have an indication for antiplatelet therapy (e.g. coronary artery disease) but the appropriateness of such an approach is unresolved. Anticoagulation appears to be as effective as antiplatelet therapy for long-term management of acute coronary syndrome and stroke, and possibly peripheral artery disease, but causes more bleeding. Therefore, in such patients who develop atrial fibrillation, switching from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulants might be all that is required. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy has only been proven to provide additional benefit over anticoagulants alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not as effective as oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than oral anticoagulants in patients with coronary stents. Whether the benefits of triple therapy outweigh the risks in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents requires evaluation in randomized trials.	Peripheral Artery Disease		Warfarin		0
24302273	Vascular disease is included in a risk scoring system to predict stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). This post hoc analysis of ROCKET AF aimed to determine the absolute rates of stroke and bleeding, and the relative effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in patients with and without peripheral artery disease (PAD). Peripheral artery disease was defined on the case-report form as the presences of intermittent claudication, amputation for arterial insufficiency, vascular reconstruction, bypass surgery, or percutaneous intervention to the extremities, or previously documented abdominal aortic aneurysm. ROCKET AF was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized-controlled trial comparing rivaroxaban and warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. A total of 839 (5.9%) patients in ROCKET AF had PAD. Patients with and without PAD had similar rates of stroke or systemic embolism [HR: 1.04, 95% CI (0.72, 1.50), P = 0.84] and major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) bleeding [HR: 1.11, 95% CI (0.96, 1.28), P = 0.17], respectively. The efficacy of rivaroxaban when compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism was similar in patients with PAD (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.63-2.22) and without PAD (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-1.02; interaction P = 0.34). There was a significant interaction for major or NMCR bleeding in patients with PAD treated with rivaroxaban compared with warfarin (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.06-1.86) compared with those without PAD (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.95-1.11; interaction P = 0.037). Patients with PAD in ROCKET AF did not have a statistically significant higher risk of stroke or systemic embolism than patients without PAD, and there were similar efficacy outcomes in patients treated with rivaroxaban and warfarin. In PAD patients, there was a higher risk of major bleeding or NMCR bleeding with rivaroxaban when compared with warfarin (interaction P = 0.037). Further investigation is warranted to validate this subgroup analysis and determine the optimal treatment in this high-risk cohort of AF patients with PAD.	Peripheral Artery Disease		Warfarin		1
15930419	The management of warfarin therapy is complicated by a wide variation among patients in drug response. Variants in the gene encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) may affect the response to warfarin. We conducted a retrospective study of European-American patients receiving long-term warfarin maintenance therapy. Multiple linear-regression analysis was used to determine the effect of VKORC1 haplotypes on the warfarin dose. We determined VKORC1 haplotype frequencies in African-American, European-American, and Asian-American populations and VKORC1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in human liver samples. We identified 10 common noncoding VKORC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and inferred five major haplotypes. We identified a low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). The mean (+/-SE) maintenance dose of warfarin differed significantly among the three haplotype group combinations, at 2.7+/-0.2 mg per day for A/A, 4.9+/-0.2 mg per day for A/B, and 6.2+/-0.3 mg per day for B/B (P<0.001). VKORC1 haplotype groups A and B explained approximately 25 percent of the variance in dose. Asian Americans had a higher proportion of group A haplotypes and African Americans a higher proportion of group B haplotypes. VKORC1 mRNA levels varied according to the haplotype combination. VKORC1 haplotypes can be used to stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-dose warfarin groups and may explain differences in dose requirements among patients of different ancestries. The molecular mechanism of this warfarin dose response appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
14765194	Coumarin derivatives such as warfarin represent the therapy of choice for the long-term treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. Coumarins target blood coagulation by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase multiprotein complex (VKOR). This complex recycles vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K hydroquinone, a cofactor that is essential for the post-translational gamma-carboxylation of several blood coagulation factors. Despite extensive efforts, the components of the VKOR complex have not been identified. The complex has been proposed to be involved in two heritable human diseases: combined deficiency of vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors type 2 (VKCFD2; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 607473), and resistance to coumarin-type anticoagulant drugs (warfarin resistance, WR; OMIM 122700). Here we identify, by using linkage information from three species, the gene vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which encodes a small transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. VKORC1 contains missense mutations in both human disorders and in a warfarin-resistant rat strain. Overexpression of wild-type VKORC1, but not VKORC1 carrying the VKCFD2 mutation, leads to a marked increase in VKOR activity, which is sensitive to warfarin inhibition.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
15947090	Current dosing algorithms do not account for genetic and environmental factors for warfarin dose determinations. This study investigated the contribution of age, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, and body size to warfarin-dose requirements. Studied were 297 patients with stable anticoagulation with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Genetic analyses for CYP2C9 (*2 and *3 alleles) and VKORC1 (-1639 polymorphism) were performed and venous INR and plasma R- and S-warfarin concentrations determined. The mean warfarin daily dose requirement was highest in CYP2C9 homozygous wild-type patients, compared with those with the variant *2 and *3 alleles (P < .001) and highest in patients with the VKORC1 (position -1639) GG genotype compared with those with the GA genotype and the AA genotype (P < .001). Mean warfarin daily dose requirements fell by 0.5 to 0.7 mg per decade between the ages of 20 to 90 years. Age, height, and CYP2C9 genotype significantly contributed to S-warfarin and total warfarin clearance, whereas only age and body size significantly contributed to R-warfarin clearance. The multivariate regression model including the variables of age, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, and height produced the best model for estimating warfarin dose (R2 = 55%). Based upon the data, a new warfarin dosing regimen has been developed. The validity of the dosing regimen was confirmed in a second cohort of patients on warfarin therapy.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
18305455	Initiation of warfarin therapy using trial-and-error dosing is problematic. Our goal was to develop and validate a pharmacogenetic algorithm. In the derivation cohort of 1,015 participants, the independent predictors of therapeutic dose were: VKORC1 polymorphism -1639/3673 G>A (-28% per allele), body surface area (BSA) (+11% per 0.25 m(2)), CYP2C9(*)3 (-33% per allele), CYP2C9(*)2 (-19% per allele), age (-7% per decade), target international normalized ratio (INR) (+11% per 0.5 unit increase), amiodarone use (-22%), smoker status (+10%), race (-9%), and current thrombosis (+7%). This pharmacogenetic equation explained 53-54% of the variability in the warfarin dose in the derivation and validation (N= 292) cohorts. For comparison, a clinical equation explained only 17-22% of the dose variability (P < 0.001). In the validation cohort, we prospectively used the pharmacogenetic-dosing algorithm in patients initiating warfarin therapy, two of whom had a major hemorrhage. To facilitate use of these pharmacogenetic and clinical algorithms, we developed a nonprofit website, http://www.WarfarinDosing.org.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
26984520	Pharmacogenetics offers the potential to improve health outcomes by identifying individuals who are at greater risk of harm from certain medicines. Routine adoption of pharmacogenetic tests requires evidence of their cost effectiveness. The present review aims to systematically review published economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic tests that aim to prevent or reduce the incidence of ADRs. We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic tests aimed to reduce the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Literature was searched using Embase, MEDLINE and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database with search terms relating to pharmacogenetic testing, adverse drug reactions, economic evaluations and pharmaceuticals. Titles were screened independently by two reviewers. Articles deemed to meet the inclusion criteria were screened independently on abstract, and full texts reviewed. We identified 852 articles, of which 47 met the inclusion criteria. There was evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of testing for HLA-B*57:01 (prior to abacavir), HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 (prior to carbamazepine), HLA-B*58:01 (prior to allopurinol) and CYP2C19 (prior to clopidogrel treatment). Economic evidence was inconclusive with respect to TPMT (prior to 6-mercaptoputine, azathioprine and cisplatin therapy), CYP2C9 and VKORC1 (to inform genotype-guided dosing of coumarin derivatives), MTHFR (prior to methotrexate treatment) and factor V Leiden testing (prior to oral contraception). Testing for A1555G is not cost effective before prescribing aminoglycosides. Our systematic review identified robust evidence of the cost effectiveness of genotyping prior to treatment with a number of common drugs. However, further analyses and (or) availability of robust clinical evidence is necessary to make recommendations for others.		VKORC1	Abacavir		0
21174626	The present article summarizes the discussions of the 3rd European Science Foundation-University of Barcelona (ESF-UB) Conference in Biomedicine on Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, which was held in June 2010 in Spain. It was focused on practical applications in routine medical practice. We provide practical recommendations for ten different clinical situations, that have either been approved or not approved by regulatory agencies. We propose some comments that might accompany the results of these tests, indicating the best drug and doses to be prescribed. The discussed examples include KRAS, cetuximab, panitumumab, EGFR-gefitinib, CYP2D6-tamoxifen, TPMT-azathioprine-6-mercaptopurine, VKORC1/CYP2C9-warfarin, CYP2C19-clopidogrel, HLA-B*5701-abacavir, HLA-B*5701-flucloxacillin, SLCO1B1-statins and CYP3A5-tacrolimus. We hope that these practical recommendations will help physicians, biologists, scientists and other healthcare professionals to prescribe, perform and interpret these genetic tests.

19530963	Serious adverse drug reactions represent the sixth major cause of death in the USA, are the main reason for postmarketing drug withdrawal and represent billions of US dollars in costs every year in all developed countries. Some of these serious adverse drug reactions might be avoided by systematically screening for pharmacogenomic risk factors. During the last few years, regulatory agencies introduced pharmacogenomics labels for several drugs, but although a priori genetic testing remains advised or recommended, it is seldom compulsory due to poor evidence-based medicine knowledge. Recently published pharmacogenomic randomized, controlled and ongoing trials will progressively make genotyping tests, such as those for HLA-B*5701 (abacavir), TPMT (6-mercaptopurine), CYP2C9 plus VKORC1 (warfarin) and CYP3A5 (tacrolimus), mandatory. Parallel development of pharmacogenomic bed tests will certainly establish genetically-based prescriptions in routine medical practice.		VKORC1	Abacavir		0
20487194	Pharmacogenomics strives to explain the interindividual variability in response to drugs due to genetic variation. Although technological advances have provided us with relatively easy and cheap methods for genotyping, promises about personalised medicine have not yet met our high expectations. Successful results that have been achieved within the field of pharmacogenomics so far are, to name a few, HLA-B*5701 screening to avoid hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral abacavir, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping to avoid thiopurine toxicity, and CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping for better dosing of the anticoagulant warfarin. However, few pharmacogenetic examples have made it into clinical practice in the treatment of complex diseases. Unfortunately, lack of reproducibility of results from observational studies involving many genes and diseases seems to be a common pattern in pharmacogenomic studies. In this article we address some of the methodological and statistical issues within study design, gene and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and data analysis that should be considered in future pharmacogenomic research. First, we discuss some of the issues related to the design of epidemiological studies, specific to pharmacogenomic research. Second, we describe some of the pros and cons of a candidate gene approach (including gene and SNP selection) and a genome-wide scan approach. Finally, conventional as well as several innovative approaches to the analysis of large pharmacogenomic datasets are proposed that deal with the issues of multiple testing and systems biology in different ways.

12222994	Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) is the main (or partial) cause for large differences in the pharmacokinetics of a number of clinically important drugs. On the basis of their ability to metabolise (S)-mephenytoin or other CYP2C19 substrates, individuals can be classified as extensive metabolisers (EMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs). Eight variant alleles (CYP2C19*2 to CYP2C19*8) that predict PMs have been identified. The distribution of EM and PM genotypes and phenotypes shows wide interethnic differences. Nongenetic factors such as enzyme inhibition and induction, old age and liver cirrhosis can also modulate CYP2C19 activity. In EMs, approximately 80% of doses of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole seem to be cleared by CYP2C19, whereas CYP3A is more important in PMs. Five-fold higher exposure to these drugs is observed in PMs than in EMs of CYP2C19, and further increases occur during inhibition of CYP3A-catalysed alternative metabolic pathways in PMs. As a result, PMs of CYP2C19 experience more effective acid suppression and better healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers during treatment with omeprazole and lansoprazole compared with EMs. The pharmacoeconomic value of CYP2C19 genotyping remains unclear. Our calculations suggest that genotyping for CYP2C19 could save approximately 5000 US dollars for every 100 Asians tested, but none for Caucasian patients. Nevertheless, genotyping for the common alleles of CYP2C19 before initiating PPIs for the treatment of reflux disease and H. pylori infection is a cost effective tool to determine appropriate duration of treatment and dosage regimens. Altered CYP2C19 activity does not seem to increase the risk for adverse drug reactions/interactions of PPIs. Phenytoin plasma concentrations and toxicity have been shown to increase in patients taking inhibitors of CYP2C19 or who have variant alleles and, because of its narrow therapeutic range, genotyping of CYP2C19 in addition to CYP2C9 may be needed to optimise the dosage of phenytoin. Increased risk of toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants is likely in patients whose CYP2C19 and/or CYP2D6 activities are diminished. CYP2C19 is a major enzyme in proguanil activation to cycloguanil, but there are no clinical data that suggest that PMs of CYP2C19 are at a greater risk for failure of malaria prophylaxis or treatment. Diazepam clearance is clearly diminished in PMs or when inhibitors of CYP2C19 are coprescribed, but the clinical consequences are generally minimal. Finally, many studies have attempted to identify relationships between CYP2C19 genotype and phenotype and susceptibility to xenobiotic-induced disease, but none of these are compelling.

18171251	Voriconazole is the therapy of choice for aspergillosis and a new treatment option for candidiasis. Liver disease, age, genetic polymorphism of the cytochrome CYP2C19, and comedications influence voriconazole metabolism. Large variations in voriconazole pharmacokinetics may be associated with decreased efficacy or with toxicity. This study was conducted to assess the utility of measuring voriconazole blood levels with individualized dose adjustments. A total of 181 measurements with high-pressure liquid chromatography were performed during 2388 treatment days in 52 patients. A large variability in voriconazole trough blood levels was observed, ranging from <or=1 mg/L (the minimum inhibitory concentration at which, for most fungal pathogens, 90% of isolates are susceptible) in 25% of cases to >5.5 mg/L (a level possibly associated with toxicity) in 31% of cases. Lack of response to therapy was more frequent in patients with voriconazole levels <or=1 mg/L (6 [46%] of 13 patients, including 5 patients with aspergillosis, 4 of whom were treated orally with a median dosage of 6 mg/kg per day) than in those with voriconazole levels >1 mg/L (15 [12%] of 39 patients; P=.02). Blood levels >1 mg/L were reached after increasing the voriconazole dosage, with complete resolution of infection in all 6 cases. Among 16 patients with voriconazole trough blood levels >5.5 mg/L, 5 patients (31%) presented with an encephalopathy, including 4 patients who were treated intravenously with a median voriconazole dosage of 8 mg/kg per day, whereas none of the patients with levels <or=5.5 mg/L presented with neurological toxicity (P=.002). Comedication with omeprazole possibly contributed to voriconazole accumulation in 4 patients. In all cases, discontinuation of therapy resulted in prompt and complete neurological recovery. Voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring improves the efficacy and safety of therapy in severely ill patients with invasive mycoses.		CYP2C19	Omeprazole		0
16413245	Many drugs, including proton pump inhibitors and certain antidepressants, are metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme. A significant portion of extensive metabolizers do not reach appropriate drug levels, and our objective was to investigate any genetic background. The 5'-flanking region of the CYP2C19 gene from subjects with rapid omeprazole metabolism was sequenced, and CYP2C19 phenotype-genotype associations were analyzed in Swedish (n = 107) and Ethiopian (n = 126) extensive metabolizers. The relationship of the metabolic ratio of omeprazole (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole in plasma 3 hours after drug intake) with the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was used for prediction studies. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted by use of human nuclear protein extracts. Hepatic reporter vector transfections were carried out in CD1 mice. We identified a novel allele (CYP2C19*17) carrying -806C>T and -3402C>T, with a frequency of 18% in both Swedes and Ethiopians and 4% in Chinese subjects. In Swedes the metabolic ratio of omeprazole was higher in subjects homozygous for CYP2C19*1 (median, 0.50 [interquartile range, 0.37-0.73]) than in those homozygous for CYP2C19*17 (median, 0.25 [interquartile range, 0.15-0.33]) (P = .010). In Ethiopians a similar difference in the S/R-mephenytoin ratio was observed between individuals homozygous for CYP2C19*1 (median, 0.20 [interquartile range, 0.12-0.37]) and those homozygous for CYP2C19*17 (median, 0.05 [interquartile range, 0.03-0.06]) (P = .013). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific binding of human hepatic nuclear proteins to an element carrying -806T but not -806C. Reporter vector experiments showed an increased transcriptional activity of the CYP2C19*17 allele in vivo in mice. Predictions revealed that CYP2C19*17 homozygotes would attain 35% to 40% lower omeprazole area under the plasma concentration-time curve values than subjects homozygous for CYP2C19*1 taking standard doses of omeprazole. CYP2C19*17 is likely to cause therapeutic failures in drug treatment with, for example, proton pump inhibitors and antidepressants.		CYP2C19	Omeprazole		1
11678778	The human CYP2Cs are an important subfamily of P450 enzymes that metabolize approximately 20% of clinically used drugs. There are four members of the subfamily, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C18. Of these CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are of clinical importance. The CYP2Cs also metabolize some endogenous compounds such as arachidonic acid. Each member of this subfamily has been found to be genetically polymorphic. The most well-known of these polymorphisms is in CYP2C19. Poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2C19 represent approximately 3-5% of Caucasians, a similar percentage of African-Americans and 12-100% of Asian groups. The polymorphism affects metabolism of the anticonvulsant agent mephenytoin, proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, the anxiolytic agent diazepam, certain antidepressants, and the antimalarial drug proguanil. Toxic effects can occur in PMs exposed to diazepam, and the efficacy of some proton pump inhibitors may be greater in PMs than EMs at low doses of these drugs. A number of mutant alleles exist that can be detected by genetic testing. CYP2C9 metabolizes a wide variety of drugs including the anticoagulant warfarin, antidiabetic agents such as tolbutamide, anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The incidence of functional polymorphisms is much lower, estimated to be 1/250 in Caucasians and lower in Asians. However, the clinical consequences of these rarer polymorphisms can be severe. Severe and life-threatening bleeding episodes have been reported in CYP2C9 PMs exposed to warfarin. Phenytoin has been reported to cause severe toxicity in PMs. New polymorphisms have been discovered in CYP2C8, which metabolizes taxol (paclitaxel). Genetic testing is available for all of the known CYP2C variant alleles.		CYP2C19	Omeprazole		1

20546557	During HIV infection and/or antiretroviral therapy (ART), monocytes and macrophages exhibit a wide range of dysfunctions which contribute significantly to HIV pathogenesis and therapy-associated complications. Nevertheless, the molecular components which contribute to these dysfunctions remain elusive. We therefore applied a parallel approach of genome-wide microarray analysis and focused gene expression profiling on monocytes from patients in different stages of HIV infection and/or ART to further characterise these dysfunctions. Processes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, lipid metabolism, proteasome function, protein trafficking and transcriptional regulation were identified as areas of monocyte dysfunction during HIV infection. Individual genes potentially contributing to these monocyte dysfunctions included several novel factors. One of these is the adipocytokine NAMPT/visfatin, which we show to be capable of inhibiting HIV at an early step in its life cycle. Roughly half of all genes identified were restored to control levels under ART, while the others represented a persistent dysregulation. Additionally, several candidate biomarkers (in particular CCL1 and CYP2C19) for the development of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction were suggested. Previously described areas of monocyte dysfunction during HIV infection were confirmed, and novel themes were identified. Furthermore, individual genes associated with these dysfunctions and with ART-associated disorders were pinpointed. These genes form a useful basis for further functional studies concerning the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to HIV pathogenesis. One such gene, NAMPT/visfatin, represents a possible novel restriction factor for HIV.		CYP2C19	Abacavir		1
16170225	Pharmacogenomic studies are contributing to our understanding of interindividual differences in response to antiretroviral drugs. Genetic polymorphism in major histocompatibility complex genes predict likelihood of hypersensitivity reactions in persons prescribed abacavir, and perhaps nevirapine. Recent studies have shown that a polymorphisms in the CYP2B6 gene is associated with higher plasma efavirenz concentrations and increased efavirenz central nervous system side effects. Polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene encoding the drug pump, P-glycoprotein, may predict nevirapine-associated hepatoxicity and long-term virologic response to efavirenz. CYP2C19 polymorphisms predict nelfinavir plasma levels and, possibly, risk of virologic failure on this drug. A European mitochondrial haplogroup may predict increased risk of peripheral neuropathy associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Expansion and refinement of knowledge regarding associations between human genetics and response to antiretroviral drugs may ultimately permit individualization of therapy based on genotyping. This article summarizes a presentation on HIV therapeutics and pharmacogenomics by David W. Haas, MD, at the International AIDS Society-USA course in Atlanta in March 2005.		CYP2C19	Abacavir		0
19700688	Several long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are natural ligands of nonruminant peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), which, along with its lipogenic target genes, is upregulated in bovine mammary tissue during lactation. Thus, PPARG might represent an important control point of bovine milk fat synthesis. We tested lipogenic gene network expression via quantitative PCR of 19 genes in bovine mammary epithelial cells cultured with 16:0, 18:0, cis-9 18:1, trans-10 18:1, trans-10,cis-12 18:2 [t10c12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)], 20:5, ethanol (control), and the PPARG agonist rosiglitazone (ROSI). Triplicate cultures were maintained for 12 h with 50 muM ROSI or 100 muM LCFA. Responses common to 16:0 and 18:0 relative to the control included significantly greater expression of INSIG1 (+298%, +92%), AGPAT6 (+137%, +169%), FABP3 (+755%, +338%), and FABP4 (+171%, 157%). These were coupled with greater intracellular lipid droplet formation and mRNA of ACSS2, LPIN1, SCD, and SREBF2 in response to 16:0, and greater DGAT1 and THRSP with 18:0. Trans-10 18:1 and t10c12 CLA reduced expression of FASN (-60%, -31%), SCD (-100%, -357%), and SREBF1 (-49%, -189%). Furthermore, t10c12 CLA downregulated ACSS2, FABP3, INSIG1, SREBF2, and THRSP expression. Expression of SREBF1 was lower with cis-9 18:1 (-140%) and 20:5 (-125%) compared with the control. This latter LCFA also decreased SCD, SREBF2, and LPL expression. No effects of LCFA or ROSI on PPARG were observed, but ROSI upregulated (+39% to +269%) expression of ACACA, FASN, LPIN1, AGPAT6, DGAT1, SREBF1, SREBF2, and INSIG1. Thus, these genes are putative PPARG target genes in bovine mammary cells. This is the first report showing a direct effect of trans-10 18:1 on bovine mammary cell lipogenic gene expression. The coordinated upregulation of lipogenic gene networks in response to ROSI and saturated LCFA offers support for PPARG activation in regulating bovine milk fat synthesis.		PPARG	Rosiglitazone		1
21532596	In adipose tissue, muscle, liver and macrophages, signaling by the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a determinant of insulin sensitivity and this receptor mediates the insulin-sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs). As PPAR-γ is also expressed in neurons, we generated mice with neuron-specific Pparg knockout (Pparg brain knockout (BKO)) to determine whether neuronal PPAR-γ signaling contributes to either weight gain or insulin sensitivity. During high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, food intake was reduced and energy expenditure increased in Pparg-BKO mice compared to Pparg(f/f) mice, resulting in reduced weight gain. Pparg-BKO mice also responded better to leptin administration than Pparg(f/f) mice. When treated with the TZD rosiglitazone, Pparg-BKO mice were resistant to rosiglitazone-induced hyperphagia and weight gain and, relative to rosiglitazone-treated Pparg(f/f) mice, experienced only a marginal improvement in glucose metabolism. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies showed that the increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity induced by rosiglitazone treatment during HFD feeding was completely abolished in Pparg-BKO mice, an effect associated with the failure of rosiglitazone to improve liver insulin receptor signal transduction. We conclude that excess weight gain induced by HFD feeding depends in part on the effect of neuronal PPAR-γ signaling to limit thermogenesis and increase food intake. Neuronal PPAR-γ signaling is also required for the hepatic insulin sensitizing effects of TZDs.		PPARG	Rosiglitazone		1
14517292	The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is an important regulator of lipid and glucose homeostasis and cellular differentiation. Studies of many cell types in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that activation of PPAR gamma can reduce cellular proliferation. We show here that activation of PPAR gamma is sufficient to reduce the proliferation of cultured insulinoma cell lines. We created a model with mice in which the expression of the PPARG gene in beta cells was eliminated (beta gamma KO mice), and these mice were found to have significant islet hyperplasia on a chow diet. Interestingly, the normal expansion of beta-cell mass that occurs in control mice in response to high-fat feeding is markedly blunted in these animals. Despite this alteration in beta-cell mass, no effect on glucose homeostasis in beta gamma KO mice was noted. Additionally, while thiazolidinediones enhanced insulin secretion from cultured wild-type islets, administration of rosiglitazone to insulin-resistant control and beta gamma KO mice revealed that PPAR gamma in beta cells is not required for the antidiabetic actions of these compounds. These data demonstrate a critical physiological role for PPAR gamma function in beta-cell proliferation and also indicate that the mechanisms controlling beta-cell hyperplasia in obesity are different from those that regulate baseline cell mass in the islet.

20498072	Nocturnin (NOC) is a circadian-regulated protein related to the yeast family of transcription factors involved in the cellular response to nutrient status. In mammals, NOC functions as a deadenylase but lacks a transcriptional activation domain. It is highly expressed in bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), hepatocytes, and adipocytes. In BMSCs exposed to the PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma) agonist rosiglitazone, Noc expression was enhanced 30-fold. Previously, we reported that Noc(-/-) mice had low body temperature, were protected from diet-induced obesity, and most importantly exhibited absence of Pparg circadian rhythmicity on a high-fat diet. Consistent with its role in influencing BMSCs allocation, Noc(-/-) mice have reduced bone marrow adiposity and high bone mass. In that same vein, NOC overexpression enhances adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells but negatively regulates osteogenesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. NOC and a mutated form, which lacks deadenylase activity, bind to PPAR-gamma and markedly enhance PPAR-gamma transcriptional activity. Both WT and mutant NOC facilitate nuclear translocation of PPAR-gamma. Importantly, NOC-mediated nuclear translocation of PPAR-gamma is blocked by a short peptide fragment of NOC that inhibits its physical interaction with PPAR-gamma. The inhibitory effect of this NOC-peptide was partially reversed by rosiglitazone, suggesting that effect of NOC on PPAR-gamma nuclear translocation may be independent of ligand-mediated PPAR-gamma activation. In sum, Noc plays a unique role in the regulation of mesenchymal stem-cell lineage allocation by modulating PPAR-gamma activity through nuclear translocation. These data illustrate a unique mechanism whereby a nutrient-responsive gene influences BMSCs differentiation, adipogenesis, and ultimately body composition.		PPARG	Rosiglitazone		1
15052272	In this study, we sought out to test the hypothesis that genetic factors may influence antidepressant response to fluoxetine. The investigation focused on seven candidate genes in the serotonergic pathway involved in the synthesis, transport, recognition, and degradation of serotonin. Our clinical sample consisted of 96 subjects with unipolar major depression treated with fluoxetine with response variables assessed after a 12-week trial. Patient data were also collected to investigate the pattern of drug response. Using a high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platform and capillary electrophoresis, we genotyped patients at 110 SNPs and four repeat polymorphisms located in seven candidate genes (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, MAOA, SLC6A4, TPH1, and TPH2). Statistical tests performed included single-locus and haplotype association tests, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Little evidence of population stratification was observed in the sample with 20 random SNPs using a genomic control procedure. Our most intriguing result involved three SNPs in the TPH1 gene and one SNP in the SLC6A4 gene, which show significant single-locus association when response to fluoxetine is compared to nonresponse (P=0.02-0.04). All odds ratios indicated an increased risk of not responding to fluoxetine. In the specific response vs nonspecific and nonresponse comparison, three SNPs in the TPH2 gene (P=0.02-0.04) were positively associated and one SNP in the HTR2A gene (P=0.02) was negatively associated. When comparing specific response to nonspecific response, we found significant negative associations in three SNPs in the HTR2A gene (P=0.001-0.03) and two SNPs in the MAOA gene (P=0.03-0.05). We observed variable, although strong LD, in each gene and unexpectedly low numbers of estimated haplotypes, formed from tagged SNPs. Significant haplotype associations were found in all but the HTR1A and HTR2C genes. Although these data should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, these results implicate TPH1 and SLC6A4 in general response, and HTR2A, TPH2, and MAOA in the specificity of response to fluoxetine. Intriguingly, we observe that a number of the less frequent alleles of many of the SNP markers were associated with the nonresponse and nonspecific phenotypes.		SLC6A4	Fluoxetine		1
15993855	The serotonin transporter is the molecular target of many antidepressants, and the gene (SLC6A4) encoding this protein has been associated with response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We sought to test further the hypothesis that SLC6A4 is associated with SSRI response by resequencing this gene in subjects with major depression. The sequence of all exons, parts of all introns, and the promoter region containing a polymorphic repeat polymorphism (HTTLPR) previously associated with SSRI response was determined for 96 subjects, and variants were tested for association to treatment response with fluoxetine. We screened a total of 712 kilobases of sequence and found 27 SLC6A4 variants, 21 of which were previously undescribed. Seventeen were seen on one chromosome each, including three of the five exonic variants. One polymorphism (rs25531), just upstream of the HTTLPR, showed evidence of an association with treatment response, and biochemical experiments showed this polymorphism altered binding of nuclear extracts to a consensus sequence for the activator protein 2 transcription factor, which is believed to be a critical factor in regulating neural gene expression in mammals. These results support an association between response to SSRIs and deoxyribonucleic acid variation at the serotonin transporter locus. We have also identified a potentially important functional variant that contributes to this association and a possible biologic mechanism that could mediate its effect.		SLC6A4	Fluoxetine		1
9672904	Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent and intrusive thoughts that are distressing (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform (compulsions). OCD has a partly genetic basis. For treatment of OCD, potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) drugs (clomipramine (Anafranil), fluvoxamine (Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil)), which act on the serotonin transporter protein, are uniquely efficacious. A polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene (SLC6A4) encoding this protein, was recently reported to affect protein expression and to be associated with measures of anxiety and depression and with autism (using a family-controlled transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) design). SLC6A4 therefore has strong a priori support for potentially influencing risk for OCD: the protein it encodes is a medication target; a polymorphism in the gene affects function; and that polymorphism has been shown to be associated with behavioral phenotypes. We used the TDT with a set of 34 European-American family trios, 30 unrelated and four drawn from an extended pedigree, to test for linkage disequilibrium between OCD and alleles at the SLC6A4 promoter polymorphic locus. Of 35 heterozygous parents, 24 transmitted the 'l' SLC6A4 allele and 11 transmitted the 's' allele (chi 2 TDT = 4.83; P < 0.03). Considering only the 13 SRI drug nonresponders, there were 13 heterozygous parents, of whom 10 transmitted the 'l' allele and three the 's' allele (chi 2 TDT = 3.77; P < 0.052). These data provide preliminary support for association and linkage disequilibrium between the SLC6A4 'l' allele and OCD.		SLC6A4	Fluoxetine		1
21439906	Recent major findings from studies of SLC6A4 and its corresponding protein, the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) in humans, rodents and non-human primates indicate that combinations of SLC6A4 non-coding 5', 3' UTRs and intronic regions plus coding variants acting together can change 5HT transport as much as 40-fold in vitro. In vivo, SLC6A4 variants in humans and other species lead to marked physiological changes, despite mitigating neurodevelopmental adaptations in 5-HT receptors plus compensatory alterations in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism. Polymorphisms in SLC6A4 are associated with differences in emotional, endocrine, and personality characteristics as well as many diseases. This gene, in combinations with gene×gene (G×G) and gene×environment (G×E) interactions nonetheless remains incompletely understood, with some association findings remaining controversial. Considering its primary importance in the regulation and function of the entire serotonergic system (as evidenced by the consequences of SERT-mediated reuptake inhibition by SRIs like fluoxetine in humans and of genetically engineered changes in mice and rats), it seems likely that SLC6A4 and SERT will remain areas of high interest in our field's attempts to better understand and treat 5-HT-related disorders.

18256392	Hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele. This study was designed to establish the effectiveness of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent the hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. This double-blind, prospective, randomized study involved 1956 patients from 19 countries, who were infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and who had not previously received abacavir. We randomly assigned patients to undergo prospective HLA-B*5701 screening, with exclusion of HLA-B*5701-positive patients from abacavir treatment (prospective-screening group), or to undergo a standard-of-care approach of abacavir use without prospective HLA-B*5701 screening (control group). All patients who started abacavir were observed for 6 weeks. To immunologically confirm, and enhance the specificity of, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, we performed epicutaneous patch testing with the use of abacavir. The prevalence of HLA-B*5701 was 5.6% (109 of 1956 patients). Of the patients receiving abacavir, 72% were men, 84% were white, and 18% had not previously received antiretroviral therapy. Screening eliminated immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity reaction (0% in the prospective-screening group vs. 2.7% in the control group, P<0.001), with a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 47.9%. Hypersensitivity reaction was clinically diagnosed in 93 patients, with a significantly lower incidence in the prospective-screening group (3.4%) than in the control group (7.8%) (P<0.001). HLA-B*5701 screening reduced the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In predominantly white populations, similar to the one in this study, 94% of patients do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele and are at low risk for hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Our results show that a pharmacogenetic test can be used to prevent a specific toxic effect of a drug. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00340080.)		HLA-B	Abacavir		1
11888582	The use of abacavir--a potent HIV-1 nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitor--is complicated by a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity syndrome in about 5% of cases. Genetic factors influencing the immune response to abacavir might confer susceptibility. We aimed to find associations between MHC alleles and abacavir hypersensitivity in HIV-1-positive individuals treated with abacavir. MHC region typing was done in the first 200 Western Australian HIV Cohort Study participants exposed to abacavir. Definite abacavir hypersensitivity was identified in 18 cases, and was excluded in 167 individuals with more than 6 weeks' exposure to the drug (abacavir tolerant). 15 individuals experienced some symptoms but did not meet criteria for abacavir hypersensitivity. p values were corrected for comparisons of multiple HLA alleles (p(c)) by multiplication of the raw p value by the estimated number of HLA alleles present within the loci examined. HLA-B*5701 was present in 14 (78%) of the 18 patients with abacavir hypersensitivity, and in four (2%) of the 167 abacavir tolerant patients (odds ratio 117 [95% CI 29-481], p(c)<0.0001), and the HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ3 combination was found in 13 (72%) of hypersensitive and five (3%) of tolerant patients (73 [20-268], p(c)<0.0001 ). HLA-B*5701, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3 were present in combination in 13 (72%) hypersensitive patients and none of the tolerant patients (822 [43-15 675], p(c)<0.0001). Other MHC markers also present on the 57.1 ancestral haplotype to which the three markers above belong confirmed the presence of haplotype-specific linkage disequilibrium, and mapped potential susceptibility loci to a region bounded by C4A6 and HLA-C. Within the entire abacavir-exposed cohort (n=200), presence of HLA-B*5701, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3 had a positive predictive value for hypersensitivity of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 97%. Genetic susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity is carried on the 57.1 ancestral haplotype. In our population, withholding abacavir in those with HLA-B*5701, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3 should reduce the prevalence of hypersensitivity from 9% to 2.5% without inappropriately denying abacavir to any patient.

11943262	Hypersensitivity to abacavir affects about 4% of patients who receive the drug for HIV-1 infection. We did a retrospective, case-control study to identify multiple markers in the vicinity of HLA-B associated with hypersensitivity reactions. HLA-B57 was present in 39 (46%) of 84 patients versus four (4%) of 113 controls (p<0 small middle dot0001). However, because of low numbers of women and other ethnic groups enrolled, these findings relate largely to white men. The lower sensitivity of HLA-B57 for predicting hypersensitivity to abacavir identified in this study compared with a previous report highlights that predictive values for markers will vary across populations. Clinical monitoring and management of hypersensitivity reactions among patients receiving abacavir must remain unchanged.		HLA-B	Abacavir		1
22722860	Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are highly polymorphic proteins that initiate immunity by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells. HLA polymorphisms mostly map to the antigen-binding cleft, thereby diversifying the repertoire of self-derived and pathogen-derived peptide antigens selected by different HLA allotypes. A growing number of immunologically based drug reactions, including abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), are associated with specific HLA alleles. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these associations, including AHS, a prototypical HLA-associated drug reaction occurring exclusively in individuals with the common histocompatibility allele HLA-B*57:01, and with a relative risk of more than 1,000 (refs 6, 7). We show that unmodified abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B*57:01, lying across the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and reaching into the F-pocket, where a carboxy-terminal tryptophan typically anchors peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01. Abacavir binds with exquisite specificity to HLA-B*57:01, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. In this way, abacavir guides the selection of new endogenous peptides, inducing a marked alteration in 'immunological self'. The resultant peptide-centric 'altered self' activates abacavir-specific T-cells, thereby driving polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and a systemic reaction manifesting as AHS. We also show that carbamazepine, a widely used anti-epileptic drug associated with hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*15:02 individuals, binds to this allotype, producing alterations in the repertoire of presented self peptides. Our findings simultaneously highlight the importance of HLA polymorphism in the evolution of pharmacogenomics and provide a general mechanism for some of the growing number of HLA-linked hypersensitivities that involve small-molecule drugs.

23803709	Advances in chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, particularly regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mandate regular updating of concepts and management. A European LeukemiaNet expert panel reviewed prior and new studies to update recommendations made in 2009. We recommend as initial treatment imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib. Response is assessed with standardized real quantitative polymerase chain reaction and/or cytogenetics at 3, 6, and 12 months. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels ≤10% at 3 months, <1% at 6 months, and ≤0.1% from 12 months onward define optimal response, whereas >10% at 6 months and >1% from 12 months onward define failure, mandating a change in treatment. Similarly, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 3 months and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) from 6 months onward define optimal response, whereas no CyR (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] >95%) at 3 months, less than PCyR at 6 months, and less than CCyR from 12 months onward define failure. Between optimal and failure, there is an intermediate warning zone requiring more frequent monitoring. Similar definitions are provided for response to second-line therapy. Specific recommendations are made for patients in the accelerated and blastic phases, and for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Optimal responders should continue therapy indefinitely, with careful surveillance, or they can be enrolled in controlled studies of treatment discontinuation once a deeper molecular response is achieved.

19169242	Although the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in embryonic pattern formation is well established, its functions in adult tissue renewal and maintenance remain unclear, and the relationship of these functions to cancer development has not been determined. Here we show that the loss of Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway, impairs haematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells--the cells that propagate the leukaemia--whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb, which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Hh signalling impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wild-type BCR-ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. These data indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the haematopoietic system and raise the possibility that the drug resistance and disease recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML might be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.		BCR-ABL1	Imatinib		1
20385986	There is a considerable variability in the level of molecular responses achieved with imatinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). These differences could result from variable therapy adherence. Eighty-seven patients with chronic-phase CML treated with imatinib 400 mg/d for a median of 59.7 months (range, 25 to 104 months) who had achieved complete cytogenetic response had adherence monitored during a 3-month period by using a microelectronic monitoring device. Adherence was correlated with levels of molecular response. Other factors that could influence outcome were also analyzed. Median adherence rate was 98% (range, 24% to 104%). Twenty-three patients (26.4%) had adherence <or= 90%; in 12 of these patients (14%), adherence was <or= 80%. There was a strong correlation between adherence rate (<or= 90% or > 90%) and the 6-year probability of a 3-log reduction (also known as major molecular response [MMR]) in BCR-ABL1 transcripts (28.4% v 94.5%; P < .001) and also complete molecular response (CMR; 0% v 43.8%; P = .002). Multivariate analysis identified adherence (relative risk [RR], 11.7; P = .001) and expression of the molecular human organic cation transporter-1 (RR, 1.79; P = .038) as the only independent predictors for MMR. Adherence was the only independent predictor for CMR. No molecular responses were observed when adherence was <or= 80% (P < .001). Patients whose imatinib doses were increased had poor adherence (86.4%). In this latter population, adherence was the only independent predictor for inability to achieve an MMR (RR, 17.66; P = .006). In patients with CML treated with imatinib for some years, poor adherence may be the predominant reason for inability to obtain adequate molecular responses.		BCR-ABL1	Imatinib		1
28273028	Imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, improved the prognosis for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We conducted efficacy and safety analyses on the basis of more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with CML who were treated with imatinib as initial therapy. In this open-label, multicenter trial with crossover design, we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyses included overall survival, response to treatment, and serious adverse events. The median follow-up was 10.9 years. Given the high rate of crossover among patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine (65.6%) and the short duration of therapy before crossover in these patients (median, 0.8 years), the current analyses focused on patients who had been randomly assigned to receive imatinib. Among the patients in the imatinib group, the estimated overall survival rate at 10 years was 83.3%. Approximately half the patients (48.3%) who had been randomly assigned to imatinib completed study treatment with imatinib, and 82.8% had a complete cytogenetic response. Serious adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to imatinib were uncommon and most frequently occurred during the first year of treatment. Almost 11 years of follow-up showed that the efficacy of imatinib persisted over time and that long-term administration of imatinib was not associated with unacceptable cumulative or late toxic effects.

11248153	The HER2 gene, which encodes the growth factor receptor HER2, is amplified and HER2 is overexpressed in 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers, increasing the aggressiveness of the tumor. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or with trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.		HER2	Trastuzumab		1
20728210	Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046). The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]). Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. F Hoffmann-La Roche.

16236738	We present the combined results of two trials that compared adjuvant chemotherapy with or without concurrent trastuzumab in women with surgically removed HER2-positive breast cancer. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-31 compared doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel every 3 weeks (group 1) with the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab beginning with the first dose of paclitaxel (group 2). The North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831 compared three regimens: doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel (group A), the same regimen followed by 52 weeks of trastuzumab after paclitaxel (group B), and the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab initiated concomitantly with paclitaxel (group C). The studies were amended to include a joint analysis comparing groups 1 and A (the control group) with groups 2 and C (the trastuzumab group). Group B was excluded because trastuzumab was not given concurrently with paclitaxel. By March 15, 2005, 394 events (recurrent, second primary cancer, or death before recurrence) had been reported, triggering the first scheduled interim analysis. Of these, 133 were in the trastuzumab group and 261 in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.48; P<0.0001). This result crossed the early stopping boundary. The absolute difference in disease-free survival between the trastuzumab group and the control group was 12 percent at three years. Trastuzumab therapy was associated with a 33 percent reduction in the risk of death (P=0.015). The three-year cumulative incidence of class III or IV congestive heart failure or death from cardiac causes in the trastuzumab group was 4.1 percent in trial B-31 and 2.9 percent in trial N9831. Trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improves outcomes among women with surgically removed HER2-positive breast cancer.

16236737	Trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, has clinical activity in advanced breast cancer that overexpresses HER2. We investigated its efficacy and safety after excision of early-stage breast cancer and completion of chemotherapy. This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared one or two years of trastuzumab given every three weeks with observation in patients with HER2-positive and either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer who had completed locoregional therapy and at least four cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Data were available for 1694 women randomly assigned to two years of treatment with trastuzumab, 1694 women assigned to one year of trastuzumab, and 1693 women assigned to observation. We report here the results only of treatment with trastuzumab for one year or observation. At the first planned interim analysis (median follow-up of one year), 347 events (recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, second nonbreast malignant disease, or death) were observed: 127 events in the trastuzumab group and 220 in the observation group. The unadjusted hazard ratio for an event in the trastuzumab group, as compared with the observation group, was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.67; P<0.0001 by the log-rank test, crossing the interim analysis boundary), representing an absolute benefit in terms of disease-free survival at two years of 8.4 percentage points. Overall survival in the two groups was not significantly different (29 deaths with trastuzumab vs. 37 with observation). Severe cardiotoxicity developed in 0.5 percent of the women who were treated with trastuzumab. One year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves disease-free survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer.

19217204	The clinical success of selective kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and erlotinib, as therapeutic agents for several human cancers has prompted substantial interest in the further development and clinical testing of such inhibitors for a wide variety of malignancies. While much of this effort has been focused on the receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, HER2, PDGF receptor, c-KIT, and MET, inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases are also beginning to emerge within discovery pipelines. Among these kinases, the RAF and MEK kinases have received substantial attention, owing largely to the relatively high frequency of activating mutations of RAS ( approximately 20% of all human cancers), an upstream activator of the well established RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, as well as frequent activating mutations in the BRAF kinase ( approximately 7% of all human cancers). Here, we summarize the current state of development of kinase inhibitors directed at this signaling pathway, a few of which have already demonstrating favorable toxicity profiles as well as promising activity in early phase clinical studies.

18288997	Targeted therapies by means of compounds that inhibit a specific target molecule represent a new perspective in the treatment of cancer. In contrast to conventional chemotherapy which acts on all dividing cells generating toxic effects and damage of normal tissues, targeted drugs allow to hit, in a more specific manner, subpopulations of cells directly involved in tumor progression. Molecules controlling cell proliferation and death, such as Tyrosine Kinase Receptors (RTKs) for growth factors, are among the best targets for this type of therapeutic approach. Two classes of compounds targeting RTKs are currently used in clinical practice: monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The era of targeted therapy began with the approval of Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against HER2, for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and Imatinib, a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-Abl, in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the efficacy of these treatments, clinicians had to face soon the problem of relapse, as almost invariably cancer patients developed drug resistance, often due to the activation of alternative RTKs pathways. In this view, the rationale at the basis of targeting drugs is radically shifting. In the past, the main effort was aimed at developing highly specific inhibitors acting on single RTKs. Now, there is a general agreement that molecules interfering simultaneously with multiple RTKs might be more effective than single target agents. With the recent approval by FDA of Sorafenib and Sunitinib--targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT-3 and c-Kit--a different scenario has been emerging, where a new generation of anti-cancer drugs, able to inhibit more than one pathway, would probably play a major role.

24789362	The evolving field of personalised medicine is playing an increasingly important role in cancer prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics. Its importance in clinical management is demonstrated by the recent introduction into routine clinical practice of various individualised, molecularly targeted therapies with increased efficacy and/or reduced toxicity. The identification of cancer predisposition genes, such as the BRCA genes in breast cancer, permits screening programmes to identify patients "at-risk" of developing cancer and helps them make decisions on individual risk-modification behaviours. Personalised medicine also plays an increasingly important role in cancer treatment. It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. The efficacy of various targeted therapies in such disparate tumours suggests that we are entering an era in which treatment decisions will be based on tumour molecular abnormality profile or "signature," rather than tumour tissue type or anatomical site of origin, improving patient prognosis and quality of life. This mini review focuses on the role of personalised medicine in cancer prevention and treatment as well as its future direction in oncology.		HER2	Imatinib		0
15193255	The robust clinical activity of imatinib and trastuzumab for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and breast cancer has demonstrated that blocking pathogenic tyrosine kinases can alter the natural history of human tumors. On the other hand, EGF receptor inhibitors have shown overall modest activity. The contrast in the development of these agents implies that both molecular target dependence and patient selection are essential for the successful outcome of this process. We will contrast lessons derived from the development of inhibitors of Abl, c-Kit, HER2/neu (erbB2), and EGFR, highlight successes and limitations in the field, and propose new approaches for clinical development of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

11385576	Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two main types of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, are multifactorial conditions of unknown aetiology. A susceptibility locus for Crohn's disease has been mapped to chromosome 16. Here we have used a positional-cloning strategy, based on linkage analysis followed by linkage disequilibrium mapping, to identify three independent associations for Crohn's disease: a frameshift variant and two missense variants of NOD2, encoding a member of the Apaf-1/Ced-4 superfamily of apoptosis regulators that is expressed in monocytes. These NOD2 variants alter the structure of either the leucine-rich repeat domain of the protein or the adjacent region. NOD2 activates nuclear factor NF-kB; this activating function is regulated by the carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain, which has an inhibitory role and also acts as an intracellular receptor for components of microbial pathogens. These observations suggest that the NOD2 gene product confers susceptibility to Crohn's disease by altering the recognition of these components and/or by over-activating NF-kB in monocytes, thus documenting a molecular model for the pathogenic mechanism of Crohn's disease that can now be further investigated.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
11385577	Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, which is thought to result from the effect of environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. A gene location in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, IBD1, that contributes to susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been established through multiple linkage studies, but the specific gene(s) has not been identified. NOD2, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to plant disease resistance gene products is located in the peak region of linkage on chromosome 16 (ref. 7). Here we show, by using the transmission disequilibium test and case-control analysis, that a frameshift mutation caused by a cytosine insertion, 3020insC, which is expected to encode a truncated NOD2 protein, is associated with Crohn's disease. Wild-type NOD2 activates nuclear factor NF-kappaB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides; however, this induction was deficient in mutant NOD2. These results implicate NOD2 in susceptibility to Crohn's disease, and suggest a link between an innate immune response to bacterial components and development of disease.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
12527755	Nod2 activates the NF-kappaB pathway following intracellular stimulation by bacterial products. Recently, mutations in Nod2 have been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease, suggesting a role for bacteria-host interactions in the etiology of this disorder. We show here that Nod2 is a general sensor of peptidoglycan through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria. Moreover, the 3020insC frameshift mutation, the most frequent Nod2 variant associated with Crohn's disease patients, fully abrogates Nod2-dependent detection of peptidoglycan and MDP. Together, these results impact on the understanding of Crohn's disease development. Additionally, the characterization of Nod2 as the first pathogen-recognition molecule that detects MDP will help to unravel the well known biological activities of this immunomodulatory compound.

12876555	The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Enormous progress has been made recently in understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases. Through the study of patients and mouse models, it has emerged that Crohn's disease is driven by the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), whereas ulcerative colitis is probably driven by the production of IL-13. A second area of progress is in the identification of specific genetic abnormalities that are responsible for disease. The most important finding is the identification of mutations in the gene that encodes NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2) protein in a subgroup of patients with Crohn's disease. Here, we discuss these recent findings and the implications for therapy.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
17565376	CARD15/NOD2 mutations are associated with susceptibility to Crohn's Disease (CD) and Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). CD and GVHD are suspected to be related with the dysfunction of Peyer's patches (PP) and isolated lymphoid follicles (LFs). Using a new mouse model invalidated for Card15/Nod2 (KO), we thus analysed the impact of the gene in these lymphoid formations together with the development of experimental colitis. At weeks 4, 12 and 52, the numbers of PPs and LFs were higher in KO mice while no difference was observed at birth. At weeks 4 and 12, the size and cellular composition of PPs were analysed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. PPs of KO mice were larger with an increased proportion of M cells and CD4(+) T-cells. KO mice were also characterised by higher concentrations of TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12 and IL4 measured by ELISA. In contrast, little differences were found in the PP-free ileum and the spleen of KO mice. By using chamber experiments, we found that this PP phenotype is associated with an increased of both paracellular permeability and yeast/bacterial translocation. Finally, KO mice were more susceptible to the colitis induced by TNBS. Card15/Nod2 deficiency induces an abnormal development and function of the PPs characterised by an exaggerated immune response and an increased permeability. These observations provide a comprehensive link between the molecular defect and the Human CARD15/NOD2 associated disorders: CD and GVHD.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
27639807	GATA3 is a transcription factor that regulates T-cell production of cytokines. We investigated the role of GATA3 in development of colitis in mice. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analyses of colon tissues from patients with Crohn's disease (n = 61) or ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 74) or from patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (n = 22), to measure levels of GATA3. Colitis was induced by administration of oxazolone or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to control mice, mice with T-cell-specific deletion of GATA3, and mice with deletion of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 (TNFR double knockouts); some mice were given a GATA3-specific DNAzyme (hgd40) or a control DNAzyme via intrarectal administration, or systemic injections of an antibody to TNF before or during sensitization and challenge phase of colitis induction. Colon tissues were collected and immunofluorescence and histochemical analyses were performed. Lamina propria mononuclear cells and T cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry or cytokine assays. Colonic distribution of labeled DNAzyme and inflammation were monitored by in vivo imaging (endoscopy) of mice. Levels of GATA3 messenger RNA were higher in colon tissues from patients with UC, but not ileal Crohn's disease, than control tissues; levels of GATA3 correlated with levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL] 9, IL17A, IL6, IL5, IL4, IL13, and TNF). We observed increased expression of GATA3 by lamina propria T cells from mice with colitis compared with controls. Mice with T-cell-specific deletion of GATA3 did not develop colitis and their colonic tissues did not produce inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL9, or IL13). The DNAzyme hgd40 inhibited expression of GATA3 messenger RNA by unstimulated and stimulated T cells, and distributed throughout the inflamed colons of mice with colitis. Colon tissues from mice given hgd40 had reduced expression of GATA3 messenger RNA, compared with mice given a control DNAzyme. Mice given hgd40 did not develop colitis after administration of oxazolone or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; lamina propria cells from these mice expressed lower levels of IL6, IL9, and IL13 than cells from mice given the control DNAzyme. Mini-endoscopic images revealed that hgd40 and anti-TNF reduced colon inflammation over 3 days; hgd40 reduced colitis in TNFR double-knockout mice. Levels of GATA3 are increased in patients with UC and correlate with production of inflammatory cytokines in mice and humans. A DNAzyme that prevents expression of GATA3 reduces colitis in mice, independently of TNF, and reduces levels of cytokines in the colon. This DNAzyme might be developed for treatment of patients with UC.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
17057216	Geographic and ethnic variations in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease frequency suggest that environmental factors affect disease risk. Prevention of parasitic worms (helminths) through improved hygiene may be one factor leading to the increased disease prevalence. Helminths alter host mucosal and systemic immunity. Animals exposed to helminths are protected from experimental colitis and other immunological diseases, and helminthic colonization can be used to treat ongoing murine and human disease. Helminths induce mucosal T cells to make Th2 and regulatory cytokines. Helminth-induced mucosal IL4, TGFbeta, and IL10 likely are part of the protective process. Helminths affect pathways of innate immunity like TLR4 expression and function. Worms also induce various regulatory-type T-cell subsets in the gut that limit effector T-cell growth and function. These effects of once ever-present helminths may have protected people from immune-mediated illnesses like inflammatory bowel disease.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
22573572	About 70 loci are associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD), particularly in pathways of innate immunity, autophagy, and pathogen recognition. Phenotype-genotype associations are inconsistent. CD susceptibility polymorphisms ATG16L1 rs2241880, ICAM1 rs5498, IL4 rs2070874, IL17F rs763780, IRGM rs13361189, ITLN1 rs2274910, LRRK2 rs11175593, and TLR4 rs4986790 were genotyped in a Portuguese population (511 CD patients, 626 controls) and assessed for association with CD clinical characteristics. There is a significant association of CD with the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG16L1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.36 [1.15-1.60], P = 2.7 × 10(-6) for allele G), IRGM (OR 1.56 [1.21-1.93], P = 3.9 × 10(-4) for allele C), and ITLN1 (OR 1.55 [1.28-1.88], P = 4.9 × 10(-4) for allele C). These SNPs are associated with ileal location (OR, respectively, 1.49, 1.52, and 1.70), ileocolonic location (OR, respectively, 1.31, 1.57, and 1.68), and involvement of the upper digestive tract (OR, respectively for ATG16L1 and IRGM, 1.96 and 1.95). The risk genotype GG in ATG16L1 is associated with patients who respond to steroids (OR 1.89), respond to immunosuppressants (OR 1.77), and to biologic therapy (OR 1.89). The SNPs in ITLN1 and IRGM are both associated with a positive response to biologic therapy. The risk for ileal, ileocolonic, and upper digestive tract locations increases with the number of risk alleles (OR for three alleles, respectively, 7.10, 3.54, and 12.07); the OR for positive response to biologic therapy is 3.66. A multilocus approach using autophagy-related genes provides insight into CD phenotype-genotype associations and genetic markers for predicting therapeutic responses.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
25056061	Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.

18583979	In an effort to pinpoint potential genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, research groups worldwide have published over 1,000 genetic association studies with largely inconsistent results. To facilitate the interpretation of these findings, we have created a regularly updated online database of all published genetic association studies for schizophrenia ('SzGene'). For all polymorphisms having genotype data available in at least four independent case-control samples, we systematically carried out random-effects meta-analyses using allelic contrasts. Across 118 meta-analyses, a total of 24 genetic variants in 16 different genes (APOE, COMT, DAO, DRD1, DRD2, DRD4, DTNBP1, GABRB2, GRIN2B, HP, IL1B, MTHFR, PLXNA2, SLC6A4, TP53 and TPH1) showed nominally significant effects with average summary odds ratios of approximately 1.23. Seven of these variants had not been previously meta-analyzed. According to recently proposed criteria for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic association studies, four of the significant results can be characterized as showing 'strong' epidemiological credibility. Our project represents the first comprehensive online resource for systematically synthesized and graded evidence of genetic association studies in schizophrenia. As such, it could serve as a model for field synopses of genetic associations in other common and genetically complex disorders.	Schizophrenia	DRD2			1
12554675	Although changes in nucleotide sequence affecting the composition and the structure of proteins are well known, functional changes resulting from nucleotide substitutions cannot always be inferred from simple analysis of DNA sequence. Because a strong synonymous codon usage bias in the human DRD2 gene, suggesting selection on synonymous positions, was revealed by the relative independence of the G+C content of the third codon positions from the isochoric G+C frequencies, we chose to investigate functional effects of the six known naturally occurring synonymous changes (C132T, G423A, T765C, C939T, C957T, and G1101A) in the human DRD2. We report here that some synonymous mutations in the human DRD2 have functional effects and suggest a novel genetic mechanism. 957T, rather than being 'silent', altered the predicted mRNA folding, led to a decrease in mRNA stability and translation, and dramatically changed dopamine-induced up-regulation of DRD2 expression. 1101A did not show an effect by itself but annulled the above effects of 957T in the compound clone 957T/1101A, demonstrating that combinations of synonymous mutations can have functional consequences drastically different from those of each isolated mutation. C957T was found to be in linkage disequilibrium in a European-American population with the -141C Ins/Del and TaqI 'A' variants, which have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and alcoholism, respectively. These results call into question some assumptions made about synonymous variation in molecular population genetics and gene-mapping studies of diseases with complex inheritance, and indicate that synonymous variation can have effects of potential pathophysiological and pharmacogenetic importance.

1832466	--The A1 allele of the Taq I polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene has been earlier reported to occur in 69% of alcoholics, compared with 20% of controls. Other research has reported no significant difference in the prevalence of the A1 allele in alcoholics vs controls and no evidence that the DRD2 gene was linked to alcoholism. We hypothesized that these seemingly conflicting results might be because increases in the prevalence of the A1 allele may not be specific to alcoholism. Thus, we examined other disorders frequently associated with alcoholism or those believed to involve defects in dopaminergic neurotransmission. --Case comparison study. To minimize the effect of racial differences in gene frequencies, the study was restricted to non-Hispanic whites. --Ambulatory and hospitalized patients. --Among all known controls (n = 314), 77 (24.5%) carried the A1 allele. Of the 69 controls known not to be alcoholics, 10 (14.5%) carried the A1 allele. The prevalence of the A1 allele was significantly increased in patients with Tourette's syndrome (44.9%, n = 147), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (46.2%, n = 104), autism (54.5%, n = 33), alcoholism (42.3%, n = 104), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45.7%, n = 35). After correction for multiple comparisons (requiring P less than .0009 for significance), all remained significant except posttraumatic stress disorder. The prevalence of the A1 allele was not significantly increased in patients with depression, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, or obesity. The prevalence of the A1 allele in drug addiction and schizophrenia was only significant when compared with that of controls who were not alcoholics, and no correction was made for multiple comparisons. --These results suggest the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with a number of behavior disorders in which it may act as a modifying gene rather than as the primary etiological agent.

10530637	Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), a syndrome characterized by an increased frequency of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is associated with small interstitial deletions of chromosome 22q11. We evaluated 50 adults with VCFS using a structured clinical interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry or Psychiatric Assessment Schedule for Adults With Developmental Disability if IQ <50) to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis. The schizophrenia phenotype in individuals with VCFS and schizophrenia was compared with a matched series of individuals with schizophrenia and without VCFS (n = 12). The King's Schizotypy Questionnaire was administered to individuals with VCFS (n = 41), their first-degree relatives (n = 68), and a series of unrelated normal controls (n = 316). All individuals with VCFS deleted for the N25 probe (n = 48) were genotyped for a genetic polymorphism in the COMT gene that results in variations in enzymatic activity. Fifteen individuals with VCFS (30%) had a psychotic disorder, with 24% (n = 12) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. In addition, 6 (12%) had major depression without psychotic features. The individuals with schizophrenia had fewer negative symptoms and a relatively later age of onset compared with those with schizophrenia and without VCFS. We found no evidence that possession of the low-activity COMT allele was associated with schizophrenia in our sample of individuals with VCFS. The high prevalence of schizophrenia in this group suggests that chromosome 22q11 might harbor a gene or genes relevant to the etiology of schizophrenia in the wider population.

16319375	It has been conventional for psychiatric research, including the search for predisposing genes, to proceed under the assumption that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are separate disease entities with different underlying etiologies. These represent Emil Kraepelin's traditional dichotomous classification of the so-called "functional" psychoses and form the basis of modern diagnostic practice. However, findings emerging from many fields of psychiatric research do not fit well with this model. In particular, the pattern of findings emerging from genetic studies shows increasing evidence for an overlap in genetic susceptibility across the traditional classification categories-including association findings at DAOA(G72), DTNBP1 (dysbindin), COMT, BDNF, DISC1, and NRG1. The emerging evidence suggests the possibility of relatively specific relationships between genotype and psychopathology. For example, DISC1 and NRG1 may confer susceptibility to a form of illness with mixed features of schizophrenia and mania. The elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships is at an early stage, but current findings highlight the need to consider alternative approaches to classification and conceptualization for psychiatric research rather than continuing to rely heavily on the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy. As psychosis susceptibility genes are identified and characterized over the next few years, this will have a major impact on our understanding of disease pathophysiology and will lead to changes in classification and the clinical practice of psychiatry.

16984965	The variability in phenotypic presentations and the lack of consistency of genetic associations in mental illnesses remain a major challenge in molecular psychiatry. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that altered promoter DNA methylation could play a critical role in mediating differential regulation of genes and in facilitating short-term adaptation in response to the environment. Here, we report the investigation of the differential activity of membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT) due to altered promoter methylation and the nature of the contribution of COMT Val158Met polymorphism as risk factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by analyzing 115 post-mortem brain samples from the frontal lobe. These studies are the first to reveal that the MB-COMT promoter DNA is frequently hypomethylated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, compared with the controls (methylation rate: 26 and 29 versus 60%; P=0.004 and 0.008, respectively), particularly in the left frontal lobes (methylation rate: 29 and 30 versus 81%; P=0.003 and 0.002, respectively). Quantitative gene-expression analyses showed a corresponding increase in transcript levels of MB-COMT in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients compared with the controls (P=0.02) with an accompanying inverse correlation between MB-COMT and DRD1 expression. Furthermore, there was a tendency for the enrichment of the Val allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism with MB-COMT hypomethylation in the patients. These findings suggest that MB-COMT over-expression due to promoter hypomethylation and/or hyperactive allele of COMT may increase dopamine degradation in the frontal lobe providing a molecular basis for the shared symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

22584867	We have used a translational convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach to identify and prioritize genes involved in schizophrenia, by gene-level integration of genome-wide association study data with other genetic and gene expression studies in humans and animal models. Using this polyevidence scoring and pathway analyses, we identify top genes (DISC1, TCF4, MBP, MOBP, NCAM1, NRCAM, NDUFV2, RAB18, as well as ADCYAP1, BDNF, CNR1, COMT, DRD2, DTNBP1, GAD1, GRIA1, GRIN2B, HTR2A, NRG1, RELN, SNAP-25, TNIK), brain development, myelination, cell adhesion, glutamate receptor signaling, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and cAMP-mediated signaling as key to pathophysiology and as targets for therapeutic intervention. Overall, the data are consistent with a model of disrupted connectivity in schizophrenia, resulting from the effects of neurodevelopmental environmental stress on a background of genetic vulnerability. In addition, we show how the top candidate genes identified by CFG can be used to generate a genetic risk prediction score (GRPS) to aid schizophrenia diagnostics, with predictive ability in independent cohorts. The GRPS also differentiates classic age of onset schizophrenia from early onset and late-onset disease. We also show, in three independent cohorts, two European American and one African American, increasing overlap, reproducibility and consistency of findings from single-nucleotide polymorphisms to genes, then genes prioritized by CFG, and ultimately at the level of biological pathways and mechanisms. Finally, we compared our top candidate genes for schizophrenia from this analysis with top candidate genes for bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders from previous CFG analyses conducted by us, as well as findings from the fields of autism and Alzheimer. Overall, our work maps the genomic and biological landscape for schizophrenia, providing leads towards a better understanding of illness, diagnostics and therapeutics. It also reveals the significant genetic overlap with other major psychiatric disorder domains, suggesting the need for improved nosology.	Bipolar Disorder	COMT			0
15108180	Fine-tuning of neuronal connections during development is regulated through environmental interactions. Some fine-tuning occurs through changes in gene expression and/or epigenetic gene-specific DNA methylation states. DNA methylation occurs by transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to cytosine residues in the dinucleotide sequence CpG. Although CpG sequences spread throughout the genome are usually heavily methylated, those occurring in CpG islands in the promoter regions of genes are less methylated. In most cases, the extent of DNA methylation correlates with the extent of gene inactivation. Other known epigenetic mechanisms include histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling, RNA inhibition, RNA modification, and DNA rearrangement. Exposure memory expressed as epigenetic DNA modifications allows genomic plasticity and short-term adaptation of each generation to their environment. Environmental factors that affect DNA methylation include diet, proteins, drugs, and hormones. Induced methylation changes may produce altered gene response upon subsequent hormonal stimulation. The gene-specific DNA methylation state may be preserved upon transmission through mitosis and meiosis. An increasing amount of data implicates a role for DNA methylation in multi-factorial psychiatric disorders. For example, L-methionine treatment can exacerbate psychosis; while valproate, a drug producing hypomethylated DNA, reduces such symptoms. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the RELN gene correlates with reduced gene expression. This gene's protein Reelin, which is necessary for neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, is reduced in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting hypermethylation of the promoter region in these disorders. Some evidence implicates methylation of the promoter regions of the DRD2 and HTR2A genes in schizophrenia and mood disorders as well. DNA methylation usually increases with age, although hypomethylation of the promoter region of the amyloid A4 precursor gene during aging may play a role in Alzheimer's disease. More studies are needed to define the role of methylomics and other epigenetic phenomena in the nervous system.	Bipolar Disorder	DRD2			0
15952869	No specific gene has been identified for any major psychiatric disorder, including schizophrenia, in spite of strong evidence supporting a genetic basis for these complex and devastating disorders. There are several likely reasons for this failure, ranging from poor study design with low statistical power to genetic mechanisms such as polygenic inheritance, epigenetic interactions, and pleiotropy. Most study designs currently in use are inadequate to uncover these mechanisms. However, to date, genetic studies have provided some valuable insight into the causes and potential therapies for psychiatric disorders. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the understanding of the genetic etiology of psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, will be more successful with integrative approaches considering both genetic and epigenetic factors. For example, several genes including those encoding dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) have been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia and related disorders through meta-analyses and large, multicenter studies. There is also growing evidence for the role of DRD1, NMDA receptor genes (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent studies have indicated that epigenetic modification of reelin (RELN), BDNF, and the DRD2 promoters confer susceptibility to clinical psychiatric conditions. Pharmacologic therapy of psychiatric disorders will likely be more effective once the molecular pathogenesis is known. For example, the hypoactive alleles of DRD2 and the hyperactive alleles of COMT, which degrade the dopamine in the synaptic cleft, are associated with schizophrenia. It is likely that insufficient dopaminergic transmission in the frontal lobe plays a role in the development of negative symptoms associated with this disorder. Antipsychotic therapies with a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist effect may be a plausible alternative to current therapies, and would be effective in symptom reduction in psychotic individuals. It is also possible that therapies employing dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonists or COMT inhibitors will be beneficial for patients with negative symptoms in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The complex etiology of schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders, warrants the consideration of both genetic and epigenetic systems and the careful design of experiments to illumine the genetic mechanisms conferring liability for these disorders and the benefit of existing and new therapies.

22384243	ZNF804a was identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs1344706) in ZNF804a reached genome-wide statistical significance for association with a combined diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder. Although the molecular function of ZNF804a is unknown, the amino acid sequence is predicted to contain a C2H2-type zinc-finger domain and suggests ZNF804a plays a role in DNA binding and transcription. Here, we confirm that ZNF804a directly contributes to transcriptional control by regulating the expression of several SZ associated genes and directly interacts with chromatin proximal to the promoter regions of PRSS16 and COMT, the two genes we find upregulated by ZNF804a. Using immunochemistry we establish that ZNF804a is localized to the nucleus of rat neural progenitor cells in culture and in vivo. We demonstrate that expression of ZNF804a results in a significant increase in transcript levels of PRSS16 and COMT, relative to GFP transfected controls, and a statistically significant decrease in transcript levels of PDE4B and DRD2. Furthermore, we show using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) that both epitope-tagged and endogenous ZNF804a directly interacts with the promoter regions of PRSS16 and COMT, suggesting a direct upregulation of transcription by ZNF804a on the expression of these genes. These results are the first to confirm that ZNF804a regulates transcription levels of four SZ associated genes, and binds to chromatin proximal to promoters of two SZ genes. These results suggest a model where ZNF804a may modulate a transcriptional network of SZ associated genes.	Bipolar Disorder	DRD2			0
2010058	More than 70 mutations in the two structural genes for type I procollagen (COL1A1 and COL1A2) have been found in probands with osteogenesis imperfecta, a heritable disease of children characterized by fragility of bone and other tissues rich in type I collagen. The mutations include deletions, insertions, RNA splicing mutations, and single-base substitutions that convert a codon for glycine to a codon for an amino acid with a bulkier side chain. With a few exceptions, the most severe phenotypes of the disease are explained largely by synthesis of structurally defective pro alpha chains of type I procollagen that either interfere with the folding of the triple helix or with self-assembly of collagen into fibrils. The results emphasize the extent to which the zipperlike folding of the collagen triple helix and the self-assembly of collagen fibrils depend on the principle of nucleated growth whereby a few subunits form a nucleus and the nucleus is then propagated to generate a large structure with a precisely defined architecture. The principle of nucleated growth is a highly efficient mechanism for the assembly of large structures, but biological systems that depend extensively on nucleated growth are highly vulnerable to mutations that cause synthesis of structurally abnormal but partially functional subunits. Recently, several mutations in three other collagen genes (COL2A1, COL3A1, and COL4A5) have been found in probands with genetic diseases involving tissues rich in these collagens. Most of the probands have rare genetic diseases but a few appear to have phenotypes that are difficult to distinguish from more common disorders such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and aortic aneurysms. Therefore, the results suggest that mutations in procollagen genes may cause a wide spectrum of both rare and common human diseases.	Osteoporosis	COL1A1			1
16041384	Immunosuppressants are crucial in the prevention of detrimental immune reactions associated with allogenic organ transplantation, but they often cause adverse effects in a number of biological systems, including the skeletal system. Calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity and induce strong immunosuppression. Among NFAT proteins, NFATc1 is crucial for the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Here we show FK506 administration induces the reduction of bone mass despite a blockade of osteoclast differentiation. This reduction is caused by severe impairment of bone formation, suggesting that NFAT transcription factors also have an important role in the transcriptional program of osteoblasts. In fact, bone formation is inhibited in Nfatc1- and Nfatc2-deficient cells as well as in FK506-treated osteoblasts. Overexpression of NFATc1 stimulates Osterix-dependent activation of the Col1a1 (encoding type I collagen) promoter, but not Runx2-dependent activation of the Bglap1 (encoding osteocalcin) promoter. NFAT and Osterix form a complex that binds to DNA, and this interaction is important for the transcriptional activity of Osterix. Thus, NFAT and Osterix cooperatively control osteoblastic bone formation. These results may provide important insight into the management of post-transplantation osteoporosis as well as a new strategy for promoting bone regeneration in osteopenic disease.

11285309	Osteoporosis is a common disease with a strong genetic component. We previously described a polymorphic Sp1 binding site in the COL1A1 gene that has been associated with osteoporosis in several populations. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. A meta-analysis showed significant associations between COL1A1 "s" alleles and bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index (BMI), and osteoporotic fractures. The association with fracture was stronger than expected on the basis of the observed differences in BMD and BMI, suggesting an additional effect on bone strength. Gel shift assays showed increased binding affinity of the "s" allele for Sp1 protein, and primary RNA transcripts derived from the "s" allele were approximately three times more abundant than "S" allele--derived transcripts in "Ss" heterozygotes. Collagen produced from osteoblasts cultured from "Ss" heterozygotes had an increased ratio of alpha 1(I) protein relative to alpha 2(I), and this was accompanied by an increased ratio of COL1A1 mRNA relative to COL1A2. Finally, the yield strength of bone derived from "Ss" individuals was reduced when compared with bone derived from "SS" subjects. We conclude that the COL1A1 Sp1 polymorphism is a functional genetic variant that predisposes to osteoporosis by complex mechanisms involving changes in bone mass and bone quality.

9016532	Type I collagen is the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed of the collagen family of proteins. It is a heterotrimer comprising two alpha1(I) chains and one alpha2(I) chain which are encoded by the unlinked loci COL1A1 and COL1A2 respectively. Mutations at these loci result primarily in the connective tissue disorders osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome types VIIA and VIIB. Two instances of osteoporosis and a single instance of Marfan syndrome are also the result of mutations at these loci.

12907013	Coeliac disease is a genetically-determined chronic inflammatory intestinal disease induced by an environmental precipitant, gluten. Patients with the disease might have mainly non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and as a result patients present to various medical practitioners. Epidemiological studies have shown that coeliac disease is very common and affects about one in 250 people. The disease is associated with an increased rate of osteoporosis, infertility, autoimmune diseases, and malignant disease, especially lymphomas. The mechanism of the intestinal immune-mediated response is not completely clear, but involves an HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 restricted T-cell immune reaction in the lamina propria as well as an immune reaction in the intestinal epithelium. An important component of the disease is the intraepithelial lymphocyte that might become clonally expanded in refractory sprue and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Study of the mechanism of the immune response in coeliac disease could provide insight into the mechanism of inflammatory and autoimmune responses and lead to innovations in treatment.	Osteoporosis	HLA-DQ2			0
21278763	Until a few years ago, celiac disease (CD) was thought to be a rare food intolerance that was confined to childhood and characterized by severe malabsorption and flat intestinal mucosa. Currently, CD is regarded as an autoimmune disorder that is common in the general population (affecting 1 in 100 individuals), with possible onset at any age and with many possible presentations. The identification of CD is challenging because it can begin not only with diarrhea and weight loss but also with atypical gastrointestinal (constipation and recurrent abdominal pain) and extra-intestinal symptoms (anemia, raised transaminases, osteoporosis, recurrent miscarriages, aphthous stomatitis and associated autoimmune disorders), or it could be completely symptomless. Over the last 20 years, the diagnostic accuracy of serology for CD has progressively increased with the development of highly reliable tests, such as the detection of IgA tissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial and IgG antideamidated gliadin peptide antibodies. The routine use of antibody markers has allowed researchers to discover a very high number of 'borderline' cases, characterized by positive serology and mild intestinal lesions or normal small intestine architecture, which can be classified as potential CD. Therefore, it is evident that the 'old celiac disease' with flat mucosa is only a part of the spectrum of CD. It is possible that serology could identify CD in its early stages, before the appearance of severe intestinal damage. In cases with a positive serology but with mild or absent intestinal lesions, the detection of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 can help reinforce or exclude the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.	Osteoporosis	HLA-DQ2			0
16313685	Coeliac disease is a lifelong intolerance to the gluten found in wheat, barley and rye, and some patients are also sensitive to oats. The disease is genetically determined, with 10% of the first-degree relatives affected and 75% of monozygotic twins being concordant. Of the patients with coeliac disease 95% are human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive. Characteristically, the jejunal mucosa becomes damaged by a T-cell-mediated autoimmune response that is thought to be initiated by a 33-mer peptide fragment in A2 gliadin, and patients with this disorder have raised levels of anti-endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in their blood. Coeliac disease is the major diagnosable food intolerance and, with the advent of a simple blood test for case finding, prevalence rates are thought to be approximately 1:100. Classically, the condition presented with malabsorption and failure to thrive in infancy, but this picture has now been overtaken by the much more common presentation in adults, usually with non-specific symptoms such as tiredness and anaemia, disturbance in bowel habit or following low-impact bone fractures. Small intestinal biopsy is necessary for diagnosis and shows a characteristically flat appearance with crypt hypoplasia and infiltration of the epithelium with lymphocytes. Diet is the key to management and a gluten-free diet effectively cures the condition. However, this commitment is lifelong and many aisles in the supermarket are effectively closed to individuals with coeliac disease. Compliance can be monitored by measuring antibodies in blood, which revert to negative after 6-9 months. Patients with minor symptoms, who are found incidentally to have coeliac disease, often ask whether it is necessary to adhere to the diet. Current advice is that dietary adherence is necessary to avoid the long-term complications, which are, principally, osteoporosis and small bowel lymphoma. However, risk of these complications diminishes very considerably in patients who are on a gluten-free diet.	Osteoporosis	HLA-DQ2			0
19143879	Public anxiety over gluten has fuelled widespread demand for gluten-free food, yet coeliac disease remains significantly underdiagnosed and some confusion remains regarding optimal diagnostic practices. Small bowel histology is the gold standard for diagnosis. High-quality commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for transglutaminase immunoglobulin A and deamidated gliadin immunoglobulin A and G are sensitive tools for screening, but almost 10% of coeliac disease is seronegative and serological testing is unreliable in the very young, in people already following a gluten-reduced diet, and those using immunosuppressive medications. HLA DQA and DQB genotyping to show that alleles encoding HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are absent virtually excludes coeliac disease. Confirming histological remission reduces the risks of later complications, such as osteoporosis and cancer. Monitoring remission by serology is unreliable. Because gluten is an exogenous antigen and the small intestine is readily accessible, the immunopathogenesis of coeliac disease is better understood than other strongly major histocompatibility complex class II-associated diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic targets have been identified and drugs are under development to supplement or even replace gluten-free diet. With greater awareness and non-dietary therapeutics, diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease will be increasingly prominent in medical practice.	Osteoporosis	HLA-DQ2			0
8156448	To investigate the role of IL-4 in vivo in allergic asthma, we developed a murine model of allergen-induced airway inflammation. Repeated daily exposures of actively immunized C57BL/6 mice to aerosolized ovalbumin (OVA) induced a peribronchial inflammation and an increase in eosinophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid. In IL-4 deficient (IL4-/-) mice, treated in the same way, there were substantially fewer eosinophils in BAL and much less peribronchial inflammation compared with wild type mice. In this model, mast cell deficient (W/Wv) mice developed a similar degree of BAL eosinophilia and peribronchial inflammation as wild type mice, demonstrating that the mast cell is not required for the induction of chronic airway inflammation. In contrast, BAL eosinophilia and airway inflammation were absent in OVA-treated MHC ClassII deficient (B6.Aa-/-) mice which lack mature CD4+ T lymphocytes. In conclusion, these results indicate that IL-4 is a central mediator of allergic airway inflammation, regulating antigen-induced eosinophil recruitment into the airways by a T cell dependent mechanism.	Asthma	IL4			1
22079492	IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are thought to be central to the allergic asthmatic response. Previous work supposed that the essential source of these cytokines was CD4(+) T(H)2 cells. However, more recent studies have suggested that other innate production of type 2 cytokines might be as important. Nuocytes are a novel population of IL-13-producing innate cells, which are critical for protective immunity in Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection. Given this, we investigated the potential existence and functional importance of nuocytes in experimental allergic asthma. We generated Il4(+/eGFP)Il13(+/Tomato) dual-reporter mice to study cytokine-producing cells during allergic inflammation. We adoptively transferred innate IL-13-producing cells to investigate their role in airways hyperreactivity (AHR). We show that allergen-induced nuocytes infiltrate the lung and are a major innate source of IL-13. CD4(+) T cells in the lung almost exclusively express only IL-13, whereas IL-4-producing T cells were restricted to the draining lymph nodes. Intranasal administration of IL-25 or IL-33 induced IL-13-producing nuocytes in the BAL fluid. Strikingly, adoptive transfer of wild-type nuocytes, but not Il13(-/-) nuocytes, into Il13(-/-) mice, which are normally resistant to IL-25-induced AHR, restored airways resistance and lung cell infiltration. These findings identify nuocytes as a novel cell type in allergic lung inflammation and an innate source of IL-13 that can directly induce AHR in the absence of IL-13-producing CD4(+) T cells. These data highlight nuocytes as an important new consideration in the development of future allergic asthma therapy.	Asthma	IL4			1
11709756	Asthma is a common respiratory disease that is characterized by variable airways obstruction caused by acute and chronic bronchial inflammation; associated phenotypes include bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), elevated total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin tests positive to common allergens. Binding of interleukin-13 (IL13) or interleukin-4 (IL4) to the IL4 receptor (IL4R) induces the initial response for Th2 lymphocyte polarization. Both IL13 and IL4 are produced by Th2 cells and are capable of inducing isotype class-switching of B-cells to produce IgE after allergen exposure. These cytokines also share a common receptor component, IL4R alpha. We have investigated five IL4RA single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a population of Dutch families ascertained through a proband with asthma. By considering the probands and their spouses as an unrelated sample, we observed significant associations of atopy and asthma-related phenotypes with several IL4RA polymorphisms, including S478P and total serum IgE levels (P=.0007). A significant gene-gene interaction between S478P in IL4RA and the -1111 promoter variation in IL13, previously shown to be associated with BHR (P=.003), was detected. Individuals with the risk genotype for both genes were at almost five times greater risk for the development of asthma compared to individuals with both non-risk genotypes (P=.0004). These data suggest that variations in IL4RA contribute to elevated total serum IgE levels, and interaction between IL4RA and IL13 markedly increases an individual's susceptibility to asthma.

24075231	The 3-gene signature of periostin, chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1), and Serpin β2 (SERPINB2) in airway epithelial brushings is used to classify asthma into TH2-high and TH2-low endotypes. Little is known about the utility of gene profiling in sputum as a molecular phenotyping method. We sought to determine whether gene profiling in sputum cells can identify T(H)2-high and T(H)2-low subtypes of asthma. In induced sputum cell pellets from 37 asthmatic patients and 15 healthy control subjects, PCR was used to profile gene expression of the epithelial cell signature of IL-13 activation (periostin, CLCA1, and SERPINB2), TH2 genes (IL4, IL5, and IL13), and other genes associated with airway TH2 inflammation. Gene expression levels of CLCA1 and periostin, but not SerpinB2, were significantly higher than normal in sputum cells from asthmatic subjects. Expression levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were also significantly increased in asthmatic patients and highly correlated within individual subjects. By combining the expression levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in a single quantitative metric ("T(H)2 gene mean"), 26 (70%) of the 37 asthmatic patients had T(H)2-high asthma, which was characterized by more severe measures of asthma and increased blood and sputum eosinophilia. TH2 gene mean values tended to be stable when initial values were very high or very low but fluctuated above or below the T(H)2-high cutoff when initial values were intermediate. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 transcripts are easily detected in sputum cells from asthmatic patients, and their expression levels can be used to classify asthma into T(H)2-high and T(H)2-low endotypes.

24722226	Chitin is an essential structural polysaccharide of fungal pathogens and parasites, but its role in human immune responses remains largely unknown. It is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose and its derivatives today are widely used for medical and industrial purposes. We analysed the immunological properties of purified chitin particles derived from the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which led to the selective secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. We identified NOD2, TLR9 and the mannose receptor as essential fungal chitin-recognition receptors for the induction of this response. Chitin reduced LPS-induced inflammation in vivo and may therefore contribute to the resolution of the immune response once the pathogen has been defeated. Fungal chitin also induced eosinophilia in vivo, underpinning its ability to induce asthma. Polymorphisms in the identified chitin receptors, NOD2 and TLR9, predispose individuals to inflammatory conditions and dysregulated expression of chitinases and chitinase-like binding proteins, whose activity is essential to generate IL-10-inducing fungal chitin particles in vitro, have also been linked to inflammatory conditions and asthma. Chitin recognition is therefore critical for immune homeostasis and is likely to have a significant role in infectious and allergic disease.	Asthma	NOD2			1
15990792	Interactions with microbial pathogens are crucial for the maturation of the immune system. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 1 (NOD1) is a cytosolic receptor sensing a muropeptide found mostly in gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycans. NOD1 is located on chromosome 7p14-p15, a region that has been linked with atopy. Recently, polymorphisms of the closely related NOD2 have been associated with atopy-related traits. Within a large population-based cohort of German adults (n = 1417), a case-control population for atopic eczema (n = 454), and a large cohort of parent-offspring trios for atopic eczema (189 trios), we evaluated 11 NOD1 polymorphisms for associations with atopic phenotypes. Methods Subjects were phenotyped by standardized questionnaires and interviews, skin examination, and serum IgE measurements. Genotyping was performed by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Analyses revealed significant association of one NOD1 haplotype with atopic eczema in the population-based cohort ( P = .004) and the case-control population ( P = .003). Another NOD1 haplotype was associated with decreased total IgE ( P = .008). In addition, significant associations with total serum IgE levels were observed for polymorphisms rs2907748 ( P = .006), rs2907749 ( P = .012), and rs2075822 ( P = .018). These polymorphisms were significantly associated with atopic eczema and asthma in the family-based association analyses ( P = .001-.043). Seven polymorphisms showed significant transmission distortion for total IgE levels ( P values < .0001-.029). These data indicate that genetic variants within NOD1 are important determinants of atopy susceptibility.	Asthma	NOD2			0
24137163	Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are highly conserved cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that perform critical functions in surveying the intracellular environment for the presence of infection, noxious substances, and metabolic perturbations. Sensing of these danger signals by NLRs leads to their oligomerization into large macromolecular scaffolds and the rapid deployment of effector signaling cascades to restore homeostasis. While some NLRs operate by recruiting and activating inflammatory caspases into inflammasomes, others trigger inflammation via alternative routes including the nuclear factor-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and regulatory factor pathways. The critical role of NLRs in development and physiology is demonstrated by their clear implications in human diseases. Mutations in the genes encoding NLRP3 or NLRP12 lead to hereditary periodic fever syndromes, while mutations in CARD15 that encodes NOD2 are linked to Crohn's disease or Blau's syndrome. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of risk alleles encompassing NLR genes in a host of diseases including allergic rhinitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, multi-bacillary leprosy, vitiligo, early-onset menopause, and bone density loss in elderly women. Animal models have allowed the characterization of underlying effector mechanisms in a number of cases. In this review, we highlight the functions of NLRs in health and disease and discuss how the characterization of their molecular mechanisms provides new insights into therapeutic strategies for the management of inflammatory pathologies.

15007629	In the rich, developed parts of the world there has been a steady and simultaneous increase in at least three groups of disease: (1) allergies, (2) inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and (3) autoimmunity (e.g. type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis). Because the medical world is so compartmentalised it was some time before the connection between these increases was noticed and understood. There is now evidence that the simultaneous increase in these diseases of immunodysregulation is at least partly attributable to malfunction of regulatory T cells (Treg). This paper provides an overview of relevant work in each of these fields of medicine (though with emphasis on the allergic disorders), and concludes that the increasing failure of Treg is a consequence of diminished exposure to certain micro-organisms that are "old friends", because of their continuous presence throughout mammalian evolution. These organisms, which include saprophytic mycobacteria, helminths and lactobacilli, are recognised by the innate immune system as harmless, and as adjuvants for Treg induction. Polymorphisms of components of the innate immune system such as TLR2 and NOD2 appear to define subsets of the population that will develop immunoregulatory disorders when living in the modern environment. A further role of the "old friends" and of the Treg that they induce might be to maintain the levels of regulatory IL-10 secreting macrophages and antigen-presenting cells, which are depleted in asthma and Crohn's disease. These concepts are leading to novel therapies based on harmless organisms or their components. Phase I/II clinical trials have yielded some statistically significant results, and phase II trials are in progress.	Asthma	NOD2			0
9623982	The action of tissue Transglutaminase (TGase) on specific protein-bound glutamine residues plays a critical role in numerous biological processes. Here we provide evidence for a new role of this enzyme in the common, HLA-DQ2 (and DQ8) associated enteropathy, celiac disease (CD). The intestinal inflammation in CD is precipitated by exposure to wheat gliadin in the diet and is associated with increased mucosal activity of TGase. This enzyme has also been identified as the main target for CD-associated anti-endomysium autoantibodies, and is known to accept gliadin as one of its few substrates. We have examined the possibility that TGase could be involved in modulating the reactivity of gliadin specific T cells. This could establish a link between previous reports of the role of TGase in CD and the prevailing view of CD as a T-cell mediated disorder. We found a specific effect of TGase on T-cell recognition of gliadin. This effect was limited to gliadin-specific T cells isolated from intestinal CD lesions. We demonstrate that TGase mediates its effect through an ordered and specific deamidation of gliadins. This deamidation creates an epitope that binds efficiently to DQ2 and is recognized by gut-derived T cells. Generation of epitopes by enzymatic modification is a new mechanism that may be relevant for breaking of tolerance and initiation of autoimmune disease.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DQ2			1
12815137	Wheat, rye, and barley proteins induce celiac disease, an autoimmune type of gastrointestinal disorder, in genetically susceptible persons. Because the disease may be underdiagnosed, we estimated the prevalence of the disease and tested the hypothesis that assays for serum autoantibodies can be used to detect untreated celiac disease and that positive findings correlate with specific HLA haplotypes. Serum samples were collected from 3654 students (age range, 7 to 16 years) in 1994 and screened in 2001 for endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies. HLA typing was also performed on stored blood samples. All antibody-positive subjects were asked to undergo small-bowel biopsy in 2001. Of the 3654 subjects, 56 (1.5 percent) had positive antibody tests, as determined in 2001. Results of the two antibody tests were highly concordant. As of 1994, none of the subjects had received a clinical diagnosis of celiac disease, but 10 who had positive tests for both antibodies in serum obtained in 1994 received the diagnosis between 1994 and 2001. Of the 36 other subjects with positive antibody assays who agreed to undergo biopsy in 2001, 27 had evidence of celiac disease on biopsy. Thus, the estimated biopsy-proved prevalence was 1 case in 99 children. All but two of the antibody-positive subjects had either the HLA-DQ2 or the HLA-DQ8 haplotype. The prevalence of the combination of antibody positivity and an HLA haplotype associated with celiac disease was 1 in 67. The presence of serum tissue transglutaminase and endomysial autoantibodies is predictive of small-bowel abnormalities indicative of celiac disease. There is a good correlation between autoantibody positivity and specific HLA haplotypes. We estimate that the prevalence of celiac disease among Finnish schoolchildren is at least 1 case in 99 children.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DQ2			1
10684852	The great majority of patients that are intolerant of wheat gluten protein due to celiac disease (CD) are human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2(+), and the remaining few normally express HLA-DQ8. These two class II molecules are chiefly responsible for the presentation of gluten peptides to the gluten-specific T cells that are found only in the gut of CD patients but not of controls. Interestingly, tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-mediated deamidation of gliadin plays an important role in recognition of this food antigen by intestinal T cells. Here we have used recombinant antigens to demonstrate that the intestinal T cell response to alpha-gliadin in adult CD is focused on two immunodominant, DQ2-restricted peptides that overlap by a seven-residue fragment of gliadin. We show that tTG converts a glutamine residue within this fragment into glutamic acid and that this process is critical for T cell recognition. Gluten-specific T cell lines from 16 different adult patients all responded to one or both of these deamidated peptides, indicating that these epitopes are highly relevant to disease pathology. Binding studies showed that the deamidated peptides displayed an increased affinity for DQ2, a molecule known to preferentially bind peptides containing negatively charged residues. Interestingly, the modified glutamine is accommodated in different pockets of DQ2 for the different epitopes. These results suggest modifications of anchor residues that lead to an improved affinity for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and altered conformation of the peptide-MHC complex may be a critical factor leading to T cell responses to gliadin and the oral intolerance of gluten found in CD.

21224837	Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. "Non-celiac gluten intolerance" may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated.

9027962	HLA-DRB1,-DQA1, and -DQB1 genomic typing of 50 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and of 290 healthy blood donors was performed. Genes encoding the DQ (alpha 1*0501, beta 1*02) heterodimer were carried by 43 (86%) of the patients and 72 (25%) of the controls. Of the remaining seven patients six (12% of all the patients) carried genes encoding the DQ (alpha 1*03, beta 1*0302) heterodimer. These HLA associations are very similar to those observed in patients with celiac disease. We thus conclude that dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease are associated to the very same HLA-DQ alpha beta heterodimers.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DRB1			0
12121676	The role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 heterodimer (DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201) in presenting gluten peptides to effector T cells in celiac disease (CD) has been well documented. Because HLA-DQ2 is carried on DR3 haplotypes due to linkage disequilibrium, such haplotypes are encountered more frequently in patients with autoimmune disease. This study analyzed 35 North Indian children below 15 years of age and diagnosed to have CD as per the ESPGAN criteria, which included histopathologic alterations in duodenal biopsies, clinical response to gluten withdrawal, and presence of antiendomysial antibodies. The HLA class I and class II alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers, sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe, and reverse line strip molecular techniques. A statistically significant positive association of the disease with HLA-DRB1*03 (94.2% versus 22.1% in controls, chi(2) = 73.4, p = 7.54E-11), and a negative association with DRB1*15 (chi(2) = 7.4, p = 6.5E-03) and DRB1*13 alleles was observed. The HLA-DQB1*0201 was observed in all the 35 patients (100%), whereas the DQ2 heterodimer alpha(0)beta(0) occurred in 97.1% of CD patients (31.4% in double dose, 65.7% in single dose) and revealed significant deviation from healthy controls (chi(2) = 102.08, p = 7.56E-11). Further analysis revealed involvement of multiple DR3+ve haplotypes with CD in Indians, of which A26-B8-DR3 was the most common DR3 haplotype among patients (34.28%, chi(2) = 40.57, p = 2.65E-10) followed by Ax-B21-DR3 (11.4%) (chi(2) = 13.8, p = 2E-04) and the classical Caucasian haplotype A1-B8-DR3 (5.7%). The former two haplotypes are characteristic of Asian Indians and are involved in the development of CD. We conclude that the high risk DR3 haplotypes that play a crucial role in the development of CD are unique in Asian Indians. Detailed analysis of these haplotypes in Indian patients with autoimmune diseases may help understand the influence of other intervening genes within the major histocompatibility complex.

11112362	From 1991 to 1998 we vaccinated 4835 neonates against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and monitored their humoral response to the recombinant vaccine. In a sample of 184 of these babies we studied the association between HLA class I and II genomic polymorphisms and humoral response to the vaccine and the association between the response and immune-mediated diseases. A subgroup of 96 babies also underwent HLA class III (C4A and C4B) typing. Four levels of humoral response were identified, each with a peculiar MHC restriction. Different HLA products seem to act as agonists (C4AQ0 and HLA-DQB1(*)02) or antagonists (C4AQ0, HLA-DQB1(*)02, and HLA-DRB1(*)11, DQB1(*)0301) in lowering humoral response to HBV vaccine. The group of responders was characterized more for lacking "nonresponder" alleles than for having specific "responder" ones. Tolerance to HBV peptides may have clinical implications, possibly being a marker for babies with a genetic risk of immunopathologies. In fact, many of the poor responders carried from two to four HLA-DQ alpha beta heterodimers predisposing to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and celiac disease. Two true nonresponders suffered from allergies and two slow responders had transient episodes of hyperglycemia.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DRB1			0
10773355	The possibility that genetic susceptibility to celiac disease (CD) might be influenced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes polymorphism has repeatedly been put forward. To date, this has only been investigated in case-control studies and results have been contradictory. In order to avoid any possible ethnic mismatching between patients and controls, we have approached this problem studying 71 celiac families, establishing the parental haplotypes and comparing CD versus control haplotypes (the so-called AFBAC or affected family-based controls). We used DNA-based methods to screen for HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 alleles, TNFalpha promoter polymorphims and TNFa and b microsatellites. The guanine-to-adenine polymorphism at position -308 of the TNFalpha gene promoter region was found associated with CD as the TNF-308A allele appeared significantly increased in frequency in CD haplotypes, and this was shown to be independent of the association between CD and the DRB1*0301,DQA1*0501,DQB1*0201 alleles. Our results indicate that at least another gene, in addition to the known association of CD with HLA class II, has a susceptibility role in this disease. This should be either TNFalpha or another polymorphic gene in the telomeric end of the HLA class III region.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DRB1			1
21833088	Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous system in which the interplay between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typically results in intermittent neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of disability. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

7680433	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which a restricted cellular immune response has been observed. In order to establish whether such T cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with regard to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analysed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using the polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed messenger RNA, and compared these with TCR of previously described MBP-specific T cell clones from MS and the rat model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. The V beta 5.2-D beta-J beta sequences in these MS brain plaques revealed five motifs. One of the common motifs was identical to that described for the VDJ region of a V beta 5.2 T-cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient who was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and it was cytotoxic towards targets containing the MBP peptide 89-106 (ref. 1). The deduced amino-acid sequence of this VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in rat T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which are specific for MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with specificity for this MBP epitope constitute a large fraction (40%) of the TCR V beta 5.2 N(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The capacity of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in demyelinated human lesions indicate that T cells with this rearranged TCR may be critical in MS.

21478203	There is a striking latitudinal gradient in multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence, but exceptions in Mediterranean Europe and northern Scandinavia, and some systematic reviews, have suggested that the gradient may be an artefact. The authors sought to evaluate the association between MS prevalence and latitude by meta-regression. Studies were sourced from online databases, reference mining and author referral. Prevalence estimates were age-standardised to the 2009 European population. Analyses were carried out by means of random-effects meta-regression, weighted with the inverse of within-study variance. The authors included 650 prevalence estimates from 321 peer-reviewed studies; 239 were age-standardised, and 159 provided sex-specific data. The authors found a significant positive association (change in prevalence per degree-latitude) between age-standardised prevalence (1.04, p<0.001) and latitude that diminished at high latitudes. Adjustment for prevalence year strengthened the association with latitude (2.60, p<0.001). An inverse gradient in the Italian region reversed on adjustment for MS-associated HLA-DRB1 allele distributions. Adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies did not appreciably alter the gradient in Europe. Adjustment for some potential sources of bias did not affect the observed associations. This, the most comprehensive review of MS prevalence to date, has confirmed a statistically significant positive association between MS prevalence and latitude globally. Exceptions to the gradient in the Italian region and northern Scandinavia are likely a result of genetic and behavioural-cultural variations. The persistence of a positive gradient in Europe after adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies strongly supports a role for environmental factors which vary with latitude, the most prominent candidates being ultraviolet radiation (UVR)/vitamin D.

19197344	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex trait in which allelic variation in the MHC class II region exerts the single strongest effect on genetic risk. Epidemiological data in MS provide strong evidence that environmental factors act at a population level to influence the unusual geographical distribution of this disease. Growing evidence implicates sunlight or vitamin D as a key environmental factor in aetiology. We hypothesised that this environmental candidate might interact with inherited factors and sought responsive regulatory elements in the MHC class II region. Sequence analysis localised a single MHC vitamin D response element (VDRE) to the promoter region of HLA-DRB1. Sequencing of this promoter in greater than 1,000 chromosomes from HLA-DRB1 homozygotes showed absolute conservation of this putative VDRE on HLA-DRB1*15 haplotypes. In contrast, there was striking variation among non-MS-associated haplotypes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific recruitment of vitamin D receptor to the VDRE in the HLA-DRB1*15 promoter, confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using lymphoblastoid cells homozygous for HLA-DRB1*15. Transient transfection using a luciferase reporter assay showed a functional role for this VDRE. B cells transiently transfected with the HLA-DRB1*15 gene promoter showed increased expression on stimulation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (P = 0.002) that was lost both on deletion of the VDRE or with the homologous "VDRE" sequence found in non-MS-associated HLA-DRB1 haplotypes. Flow cytometric analysis showed a specific increase in the cell surface expression of HLA-DRB1 upon addition of vitamin D only in HLA-DRB1*15 bearing lymphoblastoid cells. This study further implicates vitamin D as a strong environmental candidate in MS by demonstrating direct functional interaction with the major locus determining genetic susceptibility. These findings support a connection between the main epidemiological and genetic features of this disease with major practical implications for studies of disease mechanism and prevention.

12114036	Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.

9547437	Although treatment of myocardial overload effectively reduces death from progression of heart failure, it is not known whether the retardation of progressive coronary artery disease obtained with lipid lowering treatment will prevent the onset and consequences of heart failure in patients without previous symptoms of heart failure. In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, 4444 patients with coronary heart disease without evidence of heart failure were randomized to placebo (n = 2223) or simvastatin 20-40 mg (n = 2221) and followed for more than 5 years. Among the patients who received placebo, 228 (10.3%) were diagnosed with heart failure during follow-up evaluation compared with 184 (8.3%) of patients who received simvastatin (P < .015). Mortality was 31.9% in the placebo group and 25.5% in the simvastatin group among patients who developed heart failure. These compare with 9.2 and 6.6%, respectively, among non-heart failure patients. There were 45 hospitalizations because of acute heart failure in the placebo group and 23 in the simvastatin group (NS). Patients who developed heart failure were more likely to have suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction and have a history of diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension than patients who did not develop congestive heart failure. Long-term prevention with simvastatin reduces the occurrence of heart failure in a cohort of patients with coronary heart disease without previous evidence of congestive heart failure.

26242379	Idelalisib, a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ, is the first agent in its class approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, exposure to idelalisib increased in a less than dose proportional manner, likely due to limited absorption of the drug. The initial approved dose of 150 mg twice daily has been supported by comprehensive exposure and response evaluations, with dose reductions to 100 mg twice daily permitted in selected toxicities. Idelalisib can be administered regardless of food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant nutritional effects and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in an approximately 79% increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Coadministration with the strong inducer rifampin resulted in a 75% reduction in idelalisib exposure (AUC), and as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. In contrast to idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice daily increased the AUC of midazolam by 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporter P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In the population pharmacokinetic model, no significant effect on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was observed for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was approximately 60% higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment; No changes related to acute renal failure were observed. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology program, including drug-drug interaction studies and mechanistic and specific population studies, which allowed a comprehensive understanding of the clinical pharmacokinetics of idelalisib and its impact on safety and clinical efficacy.	Breast Cancer		Idelalisib	Understanding the potential application of Idelalisib in breast cancer would require data or studies that specifically address its impact on the pathogenic mechanisms or therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer models or patients. Without such information, one cannot conclusively evaluate its usefulness against breast cancer based on the provided text alone. The text is valuable for understanding Idelalisib's general pharmacological profile but not sufficient to assess its potential benefits in breast cancer therapy.	0
27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare eye diseases, usually associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of episcleritis and scleritis associated with SLE, we now report 4 cases of inpatients who were diagnosed with episcleritis or scleritis secondary to SLE from September 2005 to July 2016 in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology. At Peking University People's Hospital. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were summarized along with treatment regimen and diagnosis. The literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patient. The mean age was (49.0±23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of epithelium or scleritis was (2.1±1.4) years. In addition to ocular involvement, patients had mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis, and interstitial pneumonia simultaneously; In the past, one patient had arthritis, two had Raynaud's phenomenon, and two had hematological diseases. All patients had high titer antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Antibody titers to double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) were increased in two patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other patient did not test for it. Complement levels decreased in 3 patients. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores were >4 points in all patients (range 7 to 16), indicating active disease. Ocular symptoms included pain, eye redness, and tears. Ophthalmological examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Of the four patients, two patients had ocular complications including decreased vision and uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids with hydroxychloroquine. 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All four patients received topical steroid and one patient received a periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide. One patient received a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during follow-ups. In conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including SLE. The occurrence of epithelium and scleritis may indicate active SLE disease. Patients should be aware of ocular complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment were associated with good visual outcomes at follow-up.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	While leflunomide is mentioned as part of the treatment regimen for one of the patients, the text does not delve into its effectiveness or mechanism of action specifically in the context of treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is noted as a condition experienced by some of the patients in the past, but there is no detailed analysis or discussion on whether leflunomide—or any other treatment mentioned—was directly aimed at alleviating or targeting the key pathogenic mechanisms of Raynaud's.    To evaluate whether leflunomide could be effective for Raynaud's, one would look for specific discussions on its impact on vascular function, endothelial health, or other relevant pathophysiological aspects of Raynaud's. Such details would provide insight into whether leflunomide could offer therapeutic benefits or slow disease progression for Raynaud's patients.    In conclusion, while the text is informative regarding the treatment of ocular manifestations in SLE patients and mentions leflunomide as part of a treatment regimen, it does not offer sufficient evidence or discussion to evaluate leflunomide's efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Further research or texts focusing specifically on Raynaud's and the use of leflunomide in that context would be necessary for such an evaluation.	0
21701167	Prescription omega-3 acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been tested for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmia and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert its benefit by inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Thirty patients with documented coronary artery disease and triglycerides > 250 mg/dL who were treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/day) and statins (simvastatin equivalent dose: 5-40 mg/day) were randomized 1:1. :1 to Omacor™ 1 g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregation measurement, flow cytometry, and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and after 1 and 2 weeks of PO-3A treatment. ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP antigen IIb/IIIa (p = 0.031) activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, ​​whereas Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), platelet monocyte microparticle formation (p = 0.19) and VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) showed only non-significant trends suggestive of decreased activity. Platelets. Finally, collagen and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, closure time with PFA-100 and expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), and CD40-ligand. (CD154), GP37 (CD165), intact PAR-1 receptors (SPAN 12) and cleaved epitopes (WEDE-15) were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Regardless of the dose and already after 1 week, short-term treatment with PO-3A provided a modest reduction in biomarkers of platelet activity, despite concomitant aspirin and statin therapy, when compared with placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests possible pleiotropy. These preliminary randomized data require confirmation in future studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	The results indicate that short-term therapy with PO-3A leads to a modest reduction in certain markers of platelet activity, suggesting that these omega-3-acid ethyl esters have a unique effect on platelet function beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. The significant reductions observed in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, GP IIb/IIIa antigen and activity, and P-selectin after PO-3A therapy, compared to a placebo, highlight a potential mechanism through which PO-3A could offer benefits in the context of heart disease.    Platelets play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are central to the development and progression of CAD. By reducing platelet activation and aggregation, PO-3A might help to lower the risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction, thereby potentially slowing the progression of heart disease.    The text mentions that the effects observed call for confirmation in prospective studies, indicating that while the findings are promising, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential and implications of PO-3A in heart disease. Nonetheless, this study contributes valuable evidence to the discussion on the benefits of omega-3-acid ethyl esters in heart disease, especially regarding their unique antiplatelet properties and potential role in therapeutic strategies beyond conventional treatments.	1
12676734	This review describes recent advances regarding the molecular mechanisms and trafficking pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels. AQP2 is a remarkable protein, whose sorting signals can be interpreted by various cell types to achieve apical or basal membrane entry, in both regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the known stimulatory effect of cAMP-mediated vasopressin on membrane insertion of AQP2, other signaling and trafficking events can also lead to membrane accumulation of AQP2 via cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) cGMP elevation, mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated cellular arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 is mainly recycled in epithelial cells, can be internalized into different transmembrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and these pathways can be modulated by factors including hypertonicity. The roles of additional proteins, including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive accessory protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion, are also revealed. Understanding cAMP-independent mechanisms of AQP2 membrane insertion is of particular importance for therapeutic bypass of mutated and dysfunctional vasopressin receptors in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.		AQP2	sodium	While sodium nitroprusside is mentioned, it serves as a nitric oxide donor rather than directly illustrating an interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression or trafficking. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence or discussion specifically related to sodium modulating AQP2 expression directly.    To evaluate the original question regarding sodium's interaction with AQP2 expression, one would look for research directly investigating the impact of sodium levels on AQP2 expression, trafficking, or function. This could include studies on how sodium concentration affects AQP2's cellular localization, stability, or activity, none of which are directly addressed in the given text.	0
29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), with either reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30-40% of patients) and is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for HF. All-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and the direct deleterious effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in patients with HF, and vice versa, underscoring the importance of active research on both disorders in clinical practice. There are no specific restrictions on the treatment of HF in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population showed that all HF treatments are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Regarding the treatment of T2DM in patients with HF, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line option. Sulfonylureas and insulin are conventional second- and third-line treatments although their safety in HF is unclear. Neither glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. In fact, the DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, showed a significant reduction in hospital admissions in patients with established CV disease or at risk for cardiovascular disease. Several ongoing trials should provide insight into the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.		DPP4	metformin	To evaluate whether there exists an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4, information is needed on pharmacogenetic studies, biochemical interactions, or clinical trials that specifically investigate how metformin might influence DPP4 gene expression or enzyme functionality. Such information would involve detailed discussions on the mechanisms of action of metformin that could potentially impact the DPP4 pathway.  In conclusion, while the text is useful for understanding the broader clinical implications of using various diabetes treatments in heart failure patients, it does not address the specific query about an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4. For that, a different source or text focusing specifically on pharmacogenetic interactions or the molecular effects of metformin on DPP4 would be required.	0
38574433	Doxorubicin is a potent cancer chemotherapy agent, and its use is limited due to its potential for cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a new analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has received widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on heart function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in improving doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model for studying cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly alleviated doxorubicin-induced heart dysfunction. RNA sequencing indicates that Bnip3 is a candidate gene that attenuates the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 was co-injected with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter into the tail vein of C57/BL6J mice overexpressing BNIP3, in Heart Specifically: Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented the improvement in heart function induced by semaglutide. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide, via the PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, resulting in improved mitochondrial function. Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction via the PI3K/AKT pathway, by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. Improvement in mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential treatment to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.		BNIP3	Semaglutide	The text provided is indeed useful for evaluating the interaction between the drug semaglutide and the gene BNIP3. It describes a study focused on the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, in ameliorating cardiotoxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Key findings include:  Evidence of Interaction: RNA sequencing identified BNIP3 as a candidate gene that may impair the protective effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This suggests a genetic interaction where BNIP3 expression potentially modifies the effectiveness of semaglutide in this context.  Experimental Verification: Further experiments involving overexpression of BNIP3 in mice showed that increased levels of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide from improving cardiac function, which indicates that BNIP3 expression is inversely related to the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide.  Mechanistic Insights: The text also mentions that semaglutide, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduces BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, which in turn improves mitochondrial function. This reduction in BNIP3 expression is directly linked to semaglutide's ability to mitigate mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction.  Therapeutic Implications: The conclusion that semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via a pathway that includes modulation of BNIP3 expression offers valuable insights into both the therapeutic mechanism of semaglutide and the role of BNIP3 in cardiac health.  Overall, the text clearly demonstrates that there is an interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene, with semaglutide modulating the expression of BNIP3 to exert its therapeutic effects. This interaction is relevant for understanding how semaglutide can be used to potentially mitigate cardiac injury in clinical settings involving doxorubicin treatment. The study details provided would be critical for any further research into the pharmacodynamics of semaglutide and its broader applications in cardiac therapeutics.	1
35455941	The <i>GBA</i> gene encodes the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. About 5-15% of patients with Parkinson's disease have mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene, making it the numerically most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinically, Parkinson's disease associated with<i>GBA</i>is identical to sporadic Parkinson's disease, apart from earlier age at onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment and rapid progression. Mutations in <i>GBA</i> can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. The main distinguishing feature of Parkinson's disease is the presence of protein inclusions within the neuron called Lewy bodies, which are composed mainly of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene may lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which may impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency show a defect in the autophagy pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This imbalance can also lead to aberrant lipid metabolism, including accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramides, and glucosylsphingosine. Some mutations cause GCase to be misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to activation of stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, GCase deficiency has also been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with<i>GBA</i>-PD and highlights potential therapies that may serve to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gene GBA. Here are several reasons supporting its usefulness:  Clear Connection Between GBA Mutations and PD: The text specifies that approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, establishing it as a significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. This direct association underlines the importance of the GBA gene in the context of PD.  Detailed Mechanistic Insights: The text describes how mutations in the GBA gene may lead to loss of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. This dysfunction is crucial as it impairs alpha-synuclein metabolism, a key process in the pathogenesis of PD. Alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of PD. This provides a mechanistic link between GBA mutations and the pathological features observed in PD.  Biological Consequences of GBA Mutations: The review further explains that GBA mutations can result in both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. It details how these mutations can cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. This expands on the ways in which GBA mutations can influence cellular health and PD pathology.  Association with Clinical Features of PD: It is mentioned that GBA-associated PD is clinically similar to sporadic PD but with distinct features like an earlier age at onset, more rapid progression, and more frequent cognitive impairment. This differentiation is critical for understanding the clinical impact of GBA mutations in PD patients.  Therapeutic Implications: The text highlights potential treatments targeting GCase to prevent neurodegeneration, which not only underscores the interaction between GBA and PD but also suggests practical applications of this knowledge in developing therapeutic strategies.	1
37850885	Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it is characterized by abnormal epidermal proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To study the potential role of S phase-associated protein kinase 2 (Skp2), an E3 enzyme and oncogene, in psoriasis. Gene expression and protein levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and an imiquimod-induced mouse model (IMQ), as well as from cultured endothelial cells (ECs). ). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination, and degradation were examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included fetal chorioallantoic membrane, Matrigel plug assay and quantification of angiogenesis in mouse lesions. Global knockout (KO) mice for the Skp2 gene and endothelium-specific conditional KO mice were used. Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Double immunohistochemical staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-induced PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination depends on PTEN phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In a mouse model, deficiency of the Skp2 gene ameliorated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelium-specific Skp2 KO mice developed marked psoriasis with diminished angiogenesis of the papillae. Furthermore, topical application of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevents experimental psoriasis. The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-stimulated angiogenesis may be a potential approach to treat psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease psoriasis and the gene SKP2. Here's an argument supporting its usefulness:  Direct Investigation of Skp2 in Psoriasis: The study's objectives clearly focus on examining the role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Skp2 is studied in both human and animal models, providing a comprehensive view of its function and effects in the context of this disease.  Increased Expression in Disease Context: The results show that Skp2 expression is increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis as well as in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis. This upregulation in disease contexts suggests a potential pathogenic role of Skp2 in psoriasis.  Link to Psoriasis-Associated Angiogenesis: Skp2 is associated with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae, indicating a specific role in the angiogenic aspect of psoriasis pathology. The text details how Skp2 overexpression enhances endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, which are key components of angiogenesis.  Mechanistic Insights Involving Skp2 and PTEN: The study identifies PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction leads to the degradation of PTEN, further implicating Skp2 in the molecular pathways that exacerbate psoriasis, particularly through the modulation of angiogenic processes.  Therapeutic Implications and Genetic Confirmation: Use of Skp2 inhibitors and genetic knockout models (both global and endothelial-specific) demonstrate that reducing Skp2 activity or expression can significantly ameliorate psoriasis symptoms and reduce disease-associated angiogenesis. These findings not only support the role of Skp2 in psoriasis but also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.  Broad Experimental Approaches: The combination of gene expression analysis, protein interaction studies, and functional assays in cell culture and in vivo, along with the use of both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models, provides a robust set of evidence linking Skp2 with psoriasis pathology.  In conclusion, the text is not only useful but also critical in providing detailed evidence of an interaction between psoriasis and the gene SKP2. It elucidates a specific biological pathway involving Skp2 that contributes to disease mechanisms, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The clear demonstration of increased Skp2 activity in psoriasis lesions and its role in promoting pathological angiogenesis via PTEN degradation underlines the importance of Skp2 as a molecular link in the progression of psoriasis.	1
38178103	Some studies have shown that gut microbes may be linked to dementia. However, causal influences between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as mediators remain unclear. Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia have been identified, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). ) than on a large scale. Summary data for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. There were 20 positive causal effects and 16 negative effects between genetic liability in gut microbiota and dementia. There were five positive causal effects and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementia. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Gut microbiota and cytokines have been causally associated with five types of dementia, and it appears that cytokines are not the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.	Dementia	IVW		The piece of text provided is not useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease dementia and the gene "IVW". Here are several points that clarify why the text does not serve this purpose:  Misinterpretation of "IVW": The text uses the term "IVW" in the context of statistical analysis, specifically referring to "Inverse Variance Weighting". IVW is a method used in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across multiple genetic instruments. It is not a gene, but rather a statistical technique.  Focus of the Study: The primary focus of the study is on the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia. The study aims to explore if cytokines mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and dementia, using genetic data from GWAS and MR.  No Mention of Gene IVW: There is no discussion or mention of a gene called "IVW" in the context of genetics or molecular biology within the text. Therefore, the text cannot be used to assess any interaction involving a gene named "IVW" and dementia because "IVW" in this context refers to a methodological approach, not a genetic entity.  Conclusion Misalignment: Since "IVW" refers to a method rather than a gene, the conclusions drawn from using this method (causal relationships between microbiota, cytokines, and dementia types) do not provide information about genetic interactions specific to a gene influencing dementia.  In summary, the text is useful for understanding the application of Mendelian randomization in exploring causal links between gut microbiota, cytokines, and dementia but it does not provide any insight into interactions between dementia and a gene called "IVW" simply because "IVW" is not a gene but a statistical method used in the analysis. Thus, the text cannot be used to evaluate genetic interactions involving a gene with that name in relation to dementia.	0
15201414	An open-label study indicated that selective depletion of B cells with rituximab resulted in sustained clinical improvements in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To confirm these observations, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. We randomly assigned 161 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate to receive one of four treatments: oral methotrexate (> or = 10 mg per week) (control); Rituximab (1000 mg on days 1 and 15); rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (750 mg on days 3 and 17); Or rituximab plus methotrexate. Specific responses were assessed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at week 24 (primary analyses) and week 48 (exploratory analyses). At week 24, the proportion of patients whose disease symptoms improved by 50 percent according to the ACR criteria, the primary endpoint, was significantly greater with the rituximab-methotrexate combination (43 percent, P = 0.005) and the rituximab-cyclophosphamide combination (41 percent, P = 0.005). 0.005) compared to methotrexate alone (13 percent). In all groups treated with rituximab, a significantly higher proportion of patients experienced a 20 percent improvement in disease symptoms by ACR criteria (65 to 76 percent vs. 38 percent, P < or = 0.025) or had EULAR responses (83 to 85 percent) vs. 50 percent, P < or = 0.004). All ACR responses were maintained at week 48 in the rituximab-methotrexate group. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first infusion of rituximab: at week 24, serious events occurred in one patient (2.5 percent) in the control group and in four patients (3.3 percent) in the rituximab groups. Immunoglobulin concentrations in peripheral blood remained within normal ranges. In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate, a single course of two injections of rituximab, alone or in combination with either cyclophosphamide or maintenance methotrexate, provided significant improvement in disease symptoms at both weeks 24 and 48.

20870100	Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by persistent synovitis, systemic inflammation, and autoantibodies (particularly rheumatoid factor and citrullinated peptide). 50% of the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis is due to genetic factors. Smoking is the main environmental hazard. In industrialized countries, rheumatoid arthritis affects 0.5-1.0% of adults, at a rate of 5-50 per 100-000 new cases per year. This disorder is most common in women and the elderly. Active, uncontrolled rheumatoid arthritis causes joint damage, disability, reduced quality of life, cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the main therapeutic agents, reduce synovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function. The leading DMARD is methotrexate, which can be combined with other drugs of this type. Biological agents are used when arthritis is uncontrolled or when toxic effects arise with disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were the first biologic agents, followed by abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab. Infections and high costs restrict the prescription of biological agents. The ultimate goal is long-term remission resulting from short-term, intensive treatment selected by biomarker profiles.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Rituximab		1
28264816	Recent insights into rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have necessitated updating the RA management recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). A large international task force based its decisions on evidence from 3 systematic literature reviews, and developed 4 overarching principles and 12 recommendations (versus 3 and 14, respectively, in 2013). The recommendations address conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (CSs) (DMARDs) (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GC); Biological (b) DMARDs (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, clazakizumab, sarilumab and sirukumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) ) DMARDs (Janus kinase (JAC) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treatment to target) and goals of sustained clinical remission (as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-EULAR rationale or index criteria) or decreased disease activity are discussed. Cost aspects have been taken into consideration. As a first strategy, the task force recommends MTX (rapid escalation to 25 mg/week) plus short-term GC, aiming for >50% improvement within 3 and achieving the goal within 6 months. If this fails then stratification is recommended. Without unfavorable prognostic signs, switching to or adding other csDMARDs (in addition to short-term GC) is suggested. If unfavorable prognostic signs are present (autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions, failure of 2 csDMARDs), either a bDMARD (current practice) or a Jak inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, the use of any other bDMARD or tsDMARD is recommended. If the patient is in sustained remission, bDMARDs may be tapered. For each recommendation, levels of evidence and task force agreement are provided, both of which are often very high. These recommendations are intended to inform rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies, hospital administrators, social security agencies, and regulators about the latest EULAR consensus on the management of rheumatoid arthritis, which aims to achieve the best outcomes with current treatments.

24161836	In this article, the 2010 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs and bDMARDs, respectively) are updated. The 2013 update was developed by an international working group, which based its decisions mostly on evidence from three systematic reviews of the literature (one each on sDMARDs, including glucocorticoids, bDMARDs and safety aspects of treatment with DMARDs); The searches also covered treatment strategies. The evidence presented was discussed and summarized by experts in the course of a consensus-building and voting process. Levels of evidence and scores of recommendations were extracted and levels of agreement (strengths of recommendations) were determined. Fourteen recommendations were developed (instead of 15 recommendations in 2010). Some of the 2010 recommendations were deleted, others were modified or divided. The recommendations cover general aspects, such as achieving remission or reduced disease activity using a treatment-to-target approach, and the need for shared decision-making between rheumatologists and patients. The most specific items relate to initiating DMARD treatment with a conventional sDMARD strategy (csDMARD) in combination with glucocorticoids, followed by the addition of a bDMARD or another csDMARD strategy (after stratification by presence or absence of adverse risk factors) if the treatment goal is not reached within 6 months. (Or no improvement is observed within 3 months). The tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golemumab, infliximab, biosimilars), abatacept, tocilizumab, and, under certain conditions, rituximab, are considered to have similar efficacy and safety. If the first bDMARD strategy fails, any other bDMARD strategy may be used. The recommendations also address tofacitinib as a targeted sDMARD (tsDMARD), which, where licensed, is recommended after at least one bDMARD. Biosimilars are also being addressed. These recommendations are intended to inform rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies, and other stakeholders about the latest EULAR consensus on the management of rheumatoid arthritis with sDMARDs, glucocorticoids, and bDMARDs. It is based on evidence and expert opinion and aims to improve outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Rituximab		1
10979111	Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a range of toxic effects, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) effects, due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. It is not known whether specific COX-2 inhibitors are associated with fewer GI toxic effects. To determine whether celecoxib, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of major upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. The Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a randomized, double-blind trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. Three hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 8059 patients (>/= 18 years) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 of them received at least one dose of the study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice daily (2 and 4 times the maximum doses for RA and OA, respectively; n = 3987); Ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice daily (n=1,996). The use of aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention (<=325 mg/day) has been permitted. Occurrence of future upper gastrointestinal ulcer symptoms, ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period. For all patients, the annual incidence rates of upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications alone and combined with a symptomatic ulcer for celecoxib versus NSAIDs were 0.76% versus 1.45% (P = 0.09) and 2.08% versus 3.54% (P = 0.02). respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annual incidence rates of upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications alone and with a symptomatic ulcer for celecoxib versus NSAIDs were 0.44% versus 1.27% (P = 0.04) and 1.40% versus 2.91% (P = 0.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annual incidence rates of upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications alone and with a symptomatic ulcer for celecoxib versus NSAIDs were 2.01% versus 2.12% (P = 0.92) and 4.70% versus 6.00% (P = 0.49). Fewer patients treated with celecoxib than patients treated with NSAIDs developed chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or nephrotoxicity. No difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events was observed between celecoxib and NSAIDs, regardless of aspirin use. In this study, celecoxib, at doses greater than those clinically indicated, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and combined ulcer complications, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard doses. The reduction in upper GI toxicity was stronger among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. Gamma. 2000;284:1247-1255	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Aspirin		0
12835414	Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is a powerful mediator of pain and inflammation, and high levels of this lipid mediator have been observed in many pathological conditions. Inhibiting PGE2 production to control pain and treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis has so far relied on NSAIDs such as aspirin. However, these agents inhibit the synthesis of all prostanoids. To produce biologically active PGE2, PGE enzymes catalyze the isomerization of PGH2 to PGE2. Recently, several PGEs have been identified and cloned, but their role in inflammation is unclear. To study the physiological role of individual PGEs, we generated by targeted homologous recombination a mouse line deficient in microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) on an inbred DBA/1lacJ background. mPGES1-deficient (mPGES1-/-) mice are viable, fertile, and develop normally compared to wild-type controls. However, mPGES1−/− mice showed significantly reduced inflammatory responses compared with mPGES1+/+ mice in multiple assays. Here, we identify mPGES1 as a PGE synthase that contributes to the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis, a disease model of human rheumatoid arthritis. We also show that mPGES1 is responsible for the production of PGE2 that mediates acute pain during the inflammatory response. These results suggest that mPGES1 provides a target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain associated with inflammatory conditions.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Aspirin		1
9751091	To investigate the efficacy and safety of SC-58635 (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent that acts by selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition and is not expected to cause typical gastrointestinal (GI), renal, and platelet-related symptoms. Side effects associated with COX-1 enzyme inhibition. Four phase II trials were conducted: a 2-week osteoporosis efficacy trial, a 4-week rheumatoid arthritis efficacy trial, a 1-week endoscopic study of gastrointestinal mucosal effects, and a 1-week study of effects on platelet function. Both arthritis trials determined dose levels of SC-58635 that were consistently effective in treating signs and symptoms of arthritis and were distinct from placebo on standard arthritis measures. In the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy study, 19% of people receiving naproxen (6 of 32) developed gastric ulcers, while no ulcers occurred in people receiving SC-58635 or placebo. A study of platelet effects revealed no significant effect of SC-58635 on platelet aggregation or thromboxane B2 levels, whereas aspirin caused a significant decrease in 2 of 3 measures of platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 levels. In all four trials, SC-58635 was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. SC-58635 achieves analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy in arthritis through selective COX-2 inhibition, showing no evidence of the 2 toxic effects of COX-1 inhibition associated with NSAIDs.

8618582	Acid suppression with famotidine, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, provides protection against gastric injury in normal subjects receiving short courses of aspirin or naproxen. The effectiveness of famotidine in preventing peptic ulcers in patients receiving long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is unknown. We studied the effectiveness of two doses of famotidine (20 mg and 40 mg, each given orally twice daily), compared with placebo, in preventing peptic ulcers in 285 patients without peptic ulcers who were receiving long-term treatment with NSAIDs. Steroids for rheumatoid arthritis (82 percent) or osteoporosis (18 percent). Patients were evaluated clinically and endoscopically at baseline and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. The residents were not aware of the treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of gastric or duodenal ulceration at 24 weeks. The cumulative incidence of stomach ulcers was 20 percent in the placebo group, 13 percent in the group of patients receiving 20 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.24 for comparison with placebo), and 8 percent in the group receiving famotidine 40 mg. Twice daily (P = 0.03 for comparison with placebo). The proportion of patients who developed a duodenal ulcer was significantly lower with both doses of famotidine than with placebo (13 percent in the placebo group, 4 percent in the low-dose famotidine group [P = 0.04], and 2 percent in the placebo group). P = 0.01]). Both doses of famotidine were well tolerated. Treatment with high-dose famotidine significantly reduces the cumulative incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients with arthritis receiving long-term NSAID therapy.

21870978	Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a new oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population compared to aspirin. In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test non-inferiority, with the main secondary objectives of testing superiority with respect to the primary outcome and rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. The average duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P<0.001) for noninferiority; P = 0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P < 0.001), and the rates of death. for any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P=0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P < 0.001), and the rate of hemorrhagic stroke or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P = 0.42). In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality.

11519503	Despite current treatments, patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation have high rates of major vascular events. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel when administered with aspirin in these patients. We randomly assigned 12,562 patients who presented with symptoms within 24 hours after symptom onset to receive clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, followed by 75 mg once daily) (6,259 patients) or placebo (6,303 patients) plus aspirin for 3 to 12 months. . . The first primary outcome—cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke—occurred in 9.3% of patients in the clopidogrel group and 11.4% of patients in the placebo group (relative risk with clopidogrel Compared to patients who took clopidogrel). with placebo, 0.80, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.90; The second primary outcome—the first primary outcome or refractory ischemia—occurred in 16.5 percent of patients in the clopidogrel group and 18.8 percent of patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94). . ; p < 0.001). The percentages of patients with in-hospital acute or refractory ischemia, heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also significantly lower with clopidogrel. There were significantly more patients with major bleeding in the clopidogrel group than in the placebo group (3.7 percent versus 2.7 percent; relative risk, 1.38; P = 0.001), but there were not significantly more patients with of life-threatening bleeding episodes (2.2 percent [corrected] vs. 1.8 percent; P=0.13) or hemorrhagic strokes (0.1 percent vs. 0.1 percent). The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has beneficial effects in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. However, the risk of major bleeding is increased among patients treated with clopidogrel.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
11786451	To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk for vaso-occlusive events. Collaborative meta-analyses (methodological overviews). Randomized trials of one antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high-risk patients (with acute or preexisting vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) for which results were available before September 1997. The trials had to use a randomization method that precluded knowledge prior to the next treatment to be assigned, and comparisons should be unlinked – that is, study groups that differ only in terms of their antiplatelet regimen. 287 studies included 135,000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77,000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens. “Severe vascular event”: non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. Overall, among these high-risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the pooled score for any major vascular event by approximately one-quarter; Non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by a third, non-fatal stroke by a quarter, and vascular deaths by a sixth (with no apparent negative effect on other deaths). The absolute reductions in risk of a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 person-years treated among patients with a previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for 1 month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for 2 years among those with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack; 9 (3) per 1,000 people treated for three weeks among people with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1,000 treated for 2 years among other high-risk patients (with results separately significant for those with stable angina (P = 0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P = 0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P = 0.01 )). In each of these high-risk categories, the absolute benefits greatly outweigh the absolute risks of major extracranial hemorrhage. Aspirin has been the most extensively studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75 to 150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily have been less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its counterpart ticlopidine. Adding dipyridamole to aspirin did not result in a significant reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk for immediate coronary occlusion, short-term addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented 20 (4) additional vascular events per 1,000 (P < 0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rare) bleeding often fatal) outside the skull per 1,000. Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is prophylactic in most types of patients at increased risk of vaso-occlusive events, including those with acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, Or unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischemia. - Peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long-term use, but in severe cases an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may provide additional benefits in some clinical situations, but more research into this strategy is needed.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
8918275	Several clinical trials have evaluated the benefit of long-term use of antiplatelet drugs in reducing the risk of clinical thrombotic events. Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have serious potential adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation. The CAPRIE trial was an international, randomized, blinded trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome group of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. ; Their relative safety was also evaluated. The population studied consisted of subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease manifesting as either recent ischemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years. 19,185 patients were recruited, with more than 6,300 patients in each clinical subgroup, over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1.91 years. There were 1,960 primary events included in the outcome set, with intention-to-treat analysis showing that patients treated with clopidogrel had a 5.32% annual risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5.83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statistically significant (p = 0.043) reduction in relative risk of 8.7% in favor of clopidogrel (95% Cl 0.3-16.5). The corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative risk reduction of 9.4%. There were no significant differences in terms of safety. Adverse experiences reported in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups were judged to be severe rash (0.26% vs. 0.10%), diarrhea (0.23% vs. 0.11%), upper GI discomfort (0.97% vs. 1.22%), and bleeding. intracranial (0.33% vs. 0.47). %), and gastrointestinal bleeding (0.52% vs. 0.72%), respectively. There were ten (0.10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with a significant decrease in neutrophils (<1.2 × 10(9)/L) and 16 (0.17%) in the aspirin group. Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The overall safety of clopidogrel is at least as good as that of moderate-dose aspirin.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
12114036	Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, in such populations, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely independent of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary artery disease, other arterial-occlusive disease or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive simvastatin 40 mg daily (median compliance: 85%) or placebo Matched (average statin use without study: 17%). ). Analyzes are first performed for specific events, comparing all participants assigned to simvastatin versus all participants assigned to placebo. These “intention-to-treat” comparisons evaluate the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which resulted in a mean difference in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (About two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg of simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or nonfatal vascular events (for subgroup analyses), with subcategories for cancer and other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1,328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 simvastatin assigned vs. 1,507 [14.7%] among 10,267 placebo assigned; P = 0.0003), due to a very significant relative reduction of 18%. (SE 5) in coronary mortality (587 [5.7%] vs. 707 [6.9%]; P = 0.0005), and a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs. 230 [2.2%]; P = 0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular mortality (547 [5.3%] versus 570 [5.6%]; P = 0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] versus 1212 [11.8%]; P < 0.0001), for nonfatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%]). vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularization (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a significant 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in event rate (2033 [19.8%] versus 2585 [25.2%] of affected individuals; p < 0.0001 ). During the first year, the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but was subsequently very large during each separate year. The relative reduction in event rate was similar (and significant) in every subgroup of participants studied, including: those who were not diagnosed with coronary artery disease and who had cerebrovascular disease, had peripheral artery disease, or They had diabetes; Men and women separately; Those aged 70 or over at entry; And - especially - even those with LDL cholesterol less than 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol less than 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardiac treatments. The excess annual risk of myopathy with this regimen was approximately 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalization for any reason other than vascular. Adding simvastatin to existing therapies safely results in significant additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, regardless of their initial cholesterol concentrations. An assignment of 40 mg of simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization by about a quarter. After accounting for non-compliance, actual use of this system would likely reduce these rates by about a third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individuals studied, taking simvastatin for 5 years would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should to more benefits). The magnitude of the 5-year benefit is based primarily on these individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, not on blood lipid concentrations alone.	Stroke		Simvastatin		1
26039521	Statin treatment reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, but it is not known whether the addition of ezetimibe, a non-statin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can further reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial that included 18,144 patients who were hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome within the previous 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) if they were receiving treatment. Lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if they are not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. . The average follow-up was 6 years. The average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin monotherapy group (1.8 mmol per liter). p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary endpoint at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin monotherapy group (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95). % confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P = 0.016). Rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. When added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in a gradual reduction in LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provides an additional benefit. (Funded by Merck; IMPROVE-IT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00202878.).	Stroke		Simvastatin		1
12814710	Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even though plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations are similar to those in the general population. Previous evidence about the effects of cholesterol-lowering in people with diabetes has been limited, and most people with diabetes are not currently receiving cholesterol-lowering treatment despite their increased risk. 5,963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) known to have diabetes, plus a further 14,573 with atherosclerotic disease (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg of simvastatin daily Or a matching placebo. Prespecified analyzes were in these prior disease subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, for first major coronary event (ie, nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and first major vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke, or revascularization) . Analyzes of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment period were also performed. Comparisons were made between all participants assigned to simvastatin versus all participants assigned to placebo (i.e., intention-to-treat), resulting in a mean difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during The treatment period is 5 years. Both among participants who developed diabetes and among those who did not, there were very large reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate of major coronary events, strokes, and revascularization. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a significant 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin assigned versus 748 [25.1%]) assigned to treatment. placebo, P < 0.0001), which was similar to that found among other high-risk individuals studied. There were also very significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p = 0.0003) among the 2,912 diabetic participants who had no occlusive arterial disease diagnosed at entry, and 27% (95% CI 13-40, p = 0.0003). p=0.0007) among 2426 diabetic participants whose pre-treatment LDL cholesterol concentration was <3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The relative risk reduction was also about one-quarter among various other subgroups of diabetes patients studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; People over 65 years of age at admission or with high blood pressure; and those with total cholesterol less than 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had their first major vascular event after randomization, simvastatin assignment reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period. The current study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have obvious coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. An assignment of 40 mg of simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in the broad group of diabetic patients studied. After accounting for noncompliance, actual use of this statin regimen would reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among diabetics studied without obstructive arterial disease, 5-year treatment is expected to prevent about 45 people per 1,000 from having at least one major vascular event (and of those 45 people, about 70 first prevent )or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at high enough risk for major vascular events, regardless of their initial cholesterol concentrations.

22085343	In patients with existing cardiovascular disease, residual cardiovascular risk persists despite achieving target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with statin therapy. It is not clear whether extended-release niacin added to simvastatin to raise low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is superior to simvastatin alone in reducing this residual risk. We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive extended-release niacin, 1500 to 2000 mg daily, or matching placebo. All patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe, 10 mg per day, if necessary, to maintain an LDL cholesterol level of 40 to 80 mg per deciliter (1.03 to 2.07 mmol per liter). The primary endpoint was the first event of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, or symptomatic coronary or cerebral revascularization. A total of 3414 patients were randomly assigned to receive niacin (1718) or placebo (1696). The trial was stopped after a median follow-up period of 3 years due to ineffectiveness. After two years, treatment with niacin significantly increased the average HDL cholesterol level from 35 mg per deciliter (0.91 mmol per liter) to 42 mg per deciliter (1.08 mmol per liter), and reduced the triglyceride level from 164 mg per deciliter ( 1.85 mmol per liter). L) to 122 mg per deciliter (1.38 mmol per liter), and reduced the level of harmful cholesterol from 74 mg per deciliter (1.91 mmol per liter) to 62 mg per deciliter (1.60 mmol per liter). The primary endpoint occurred in 282 patients in the niacin group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the placebo group (16.2%) (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.21; P = 0.79 by log-rank test). Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.81 mmol per liter), there was no increased clinical benefit from adding niacin to statin therapy over a 36-month follow-up period, although Great importance.

15016485	It has been consistently found that lower blood cholesterol concentrations are closely associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease but not with a lower risk of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomized trials have suggested that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation is needed. 3,280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, 17,256 adults with other arterial occlusive diseases or diabetes, or a matching placebo were randomly assigned to simvastatin 40 mg daily. Subgroup analyzes were prespecified for the first “major vascular event” (i.e., nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularization procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Sub-outcomes included any stroke and stroke subtype. Comparisons were made between all participants assigned to simvastatin versus all participants assigned to placebo (i.e., “intention to treat”), which resulted in a mean difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the treatment period. Which lasted 5 years. a period. Overall, there was a highly significant relative reduction of 25% (95% CI 15-34) in the rate of first stroke event (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs. 585 [5.7%] placebo; P < 0.0001), reflecting Specific outcome 28 percent (19-37) reduction in presumed ischemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no clear difference in strokes attributed to hemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs. 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [-0.65]. 1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers of people with transient ischemic attacks alone (2.0% vs. 2.4%; P = 0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs. 0.8%; P = 0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (P = 0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, there was no clear reduction in the rate of stroke, but there was a very significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs. 488 [29.8%]; p = 0.001). The relative reductions in stroke were about a quarter in each of the other subgroups of study participants, including: those with coronary artery disease or diabetes; Those aged 70 or over at entry; and those with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when pre-treatment LDL cholesterol was less than 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Far more people in this study had a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results showed that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral hemorrhage, even among individuals without high cholesterol concentrations. An assignment of 40 mg of simvastatin daily reduced the stroke rate by about a quarter, and so, after accounting for noncompliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would likely reduce the stroke rate by about a third. The HPS also provides conclusive evidence that statin treatment is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have obvious coronary disease.

11815421	Previous studies have shown that experimental hypercholesterolemia leads to vasodilation of the coronary artery (VV) vasculature. Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have beneficial effects independent of lipid lowering. We aimed to determine the effect of simvastatin on VV coronary angiogenesis, in the absence of cholesterol lowering. Pigs were randomized into 3 groups fed a normal (N), high-cholesterol (HC), or HC + simvastatin (HC + S) diet for 12 weeks. The proximal left anterior descending artery was isolated, examined by micro-CT, and reconstructed. Quantification of VV density was then performed in serial cross-sections along the vessel. LDL cholesterol was similarly increased in HC and HC+S compared with N. There was an increase in VV density (4.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.2 N/mm(2); P < 0.05) and vessel wall area. (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1 mm(2); P < 0.05) in HC compared to N. VV density was preserved in HC + S compared to HC (3.0 +/- 0.2 N/mm(2) ) ; P < 0.05), despite a similar increase in vessel wall area compared with N (2.5 +/- 0.1 mm(2); P < 0.05). Coronary tissue expression of VEGF was increased in HC but not in HC + S compared with N. In parallel, immunoreactivity of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in exogenous media was highlighted in HC but not in HC + S compared With N. This study demonstrates that simvastatin attenuates coronary and VV wall hypoxia in experimental hypercholesterolemia, although there is no change in plasma lipids. These data are consistent with an additional mechanism for the vascular effects of statins, independent of cholesterol lowering.	High Cholesterol		Simvastatin		0
11382730	Simvastatin attenuates ischemia and reperfusion in animals with normal cholesterol levels by stabilizing endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and inhibiting neutrophil-mediated injury. Since endothelial dysfunction is a deleterious effect of hypercholesterolemia, we examined whether short-term treatment with simvastatin could prevent leukocyte-endothelium interaction and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice. )) which feeds on a high percentage of cholesterol. Diet. We studied leukocyte-endothelium interactions in apoE(−/−) mice fed a normal diet or a high-cholesterol diet after short-term (i.e., 18 h) simvastatin treatment. We also examined simvastatin treatment in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by subjecting apoE(−/−) mice to 30 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet showed higher serum cholesterol levels, which were not affected by short-term treatment with simvastatin. However, the increased leukocyte rolling and adherence that occurred in cholesterol-fed apoE(−/−) mice ( P < 0.001 vs. control diet) was significantly attenuated by simvastatin treatment ( P < 0.01 vs. vehicle). Cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice exposed to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion also had increased myocardial necrosis ( P < 0.01 vs. control diet), which was significantly attenuated by simvastatin ( P < 0.01 vs. vehicle). Simvastatin treatment also significantly increased vascular nitric oxide production in apoE(−/−) mice. Simvastatin attenuates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and attenuates ischemic injury in hypercholesterolemic mice independently of lipid-lowering actions.	High Cholesterol		Simvastatin		0
9880379	From a physiological perspective, physical activity is expected to reduce the risk of stroke. However, epidemiological studies of physical activity and stroke risk have yielded mixed results. We therefore sought to examine the relationship between exercise and stroke risk. This was a prospective cohort study of 21,823 men, who were followed for an average of 11.1 years. Participants were from the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and beta-carotene. The men, aged 40 to 84 years at baseline, were free of self-reported myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and cancer. Basically, they reported repeating exercise vigorous enough to induce a sweat. The occurrence of stroke was self-reported by participants and confirmed after review of medical records (n=533). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the data. With adjustment for age, treatment assignment, smoking, alcohol intake, history of angina, and parental history of myocardial infarction, the relative risks of total stroke associated with vigorous exercise were <1 time, 1 time, 2 to 4 times, and >/= 5 Times per week at baseline were 1.00 (reference), 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1.03), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.03), respectively; P for trend = 0.04. In subgroup analyses, the inverse association appeared stronger for hemorrhagic stroke than for ischemic stroke. When we also adjusted for body mass index, history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, the corresponding relative risks for total stroke were 1.00 (reference), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.07), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.70). ) to 1.10), and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.13), respectively; F for trend = 0.25. Exercise vigorous enough to induce perspiration is associated with a lower risk of stroke in men. In this study, the inverse association with physical activity appears to be through beneficial effects on body weight, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and glucose tolerance. Aside from its positive effects on these variables, physical activity had no significant residual association with stroke incidence.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
11182189	The beneficial effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular disease may depend, at least in part, on their anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin and aspirin on serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. In 33 asymptomatic men with total cholesterol (TC) > 6.5 mmol L(-1) and in 25 men with coronary heart disease and borderline high cholesterol levels (between 5.2 and 6.5 mmol L(-1)) treated chronically with a low dose... Determination of aspirin (75 mg/day), CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 levels in the blood before and after treatment with simvastatin for 3 months (20-40 mg daily). In the first group, these inflammatory markers were also measured before and after a two-week treatment with aspirin (300 mg/day), which was carried out before and in combination with simvastatin. A clear decrease in CRP and TNF-alpha was found in both groups; IL-6 levels decreased only in people with marked hypercholesterolemia. Aspirin had no effect on the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin. In men with hypercholesterolemia, simvastatin treatment reduces levels of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines in the blood. Low dose aspirin does not add to the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
11171873	Previous studies of diet and coronary heart disease (CHD) have focused on the intake of nutrients rather than whole foods. Because of findings that dietary fiber, folic acid, and antioxidants may be protective for coronary heart disease, increasing vegetable intake has been recommended. However, due to the chemical and physical complexity of vegetables, the effects of individual nutrients may vary if eaten as whole foods. Furthermore, little is known about the direct relationship between vegetable intake and the risk of coronary heart disease. We prospectively evaluated the association between vegetable intake and risk of coronary heart disease in the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of aspirin and beta-carotene among 22,071 US physicians aged 40–84 years in 1982. In this analysis, we included 15,220 men without or without heart disease. Stroke or cancer at baseline who provided information on their vegetable intake at baseline and at years 2, 4 and 6 of follow-up using a simple semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire including eight vegetables. We confirmed 1148 cases of coronary heart disease (387 myocardial infarction and 761 incident cases of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) during 12 years of follow-up. After adjusting for age, randomized treatment, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, history of diabetes, history of high blood pressure, history of high cholesterol, and multivitamin use, men who took at least 2.5 serving/day of vegetables had a relative risk (RR) of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.60-0.98) for developing coronary heart disease, compared with men in the lowest category (<1 serving/day). By adjusting for the same covariates in the trend analysis that considered vegetable intake as a continuous variable, we found an RR of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71-0.98) for the risk of coronary heart disease per additional serving/day of vegetables. The inverse association between vegetable intake and risk of coronary heart disease was more pronounced among men with a BMI > or = 25 (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51-0.99) or current smokers (RR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18). -0.86) compared to the highest and lowest intake categories. Our results indicate an inverse relationship between vegetable intake and the risk of coronary heart disease. These prospective data support current dietary guidelines for increasing vegetable intake to prevent coronary heart disease.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
15897342	Homeless people represent a highly disadvantaged group in North America. Among older homeless men, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death. The aim of this study was to examine cardiovascular risk factors in a representative sample of homeless adults and to identify opportunities to improve risk factor modification. Homeless persons were randomly assigned to shelters for single adults in Toronto. The response rate was 79%. Participants (n = 202) underwent interviews, physical measurements, and blood sampling. The average age of participants was 42 years, and 89% of them were men. The prevalence of smoking among homeless persons (78%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72% to 84%) was significantly higher than in the general population (standardized morbidity ratio [SMR], 254; 95% CI, 216 to 297). High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes were no more prevalent than in the general population but were often poorly controlled. Homeless men were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than men in the general population (SMR, 79; 95% CI, 63 to 98). Past-year cocaine use was reported by 29% of subjects (95% CI, 23% to 36%). Cardiovascular disease was reported by 15% of subjects, and less than a third reported taking aspirin or cholesterol-lowering medications. According to multiple risk factor equations, the estimated median absolute 10-year risk of myocardial infarction or coronary death among homeless men aged 30 to 74 years was 5% (interquartile range, 3% to 9%). Cardiovascular risk factor modification is suboptimal among homeless adults in Toronto, despite universal health insurance. Multiple risk factor equations may underestimate true risk in this population due to inadequate accounting for factors such as cocaine use and heavy smoking.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
21128814	Rivaroxaban, an oral factor We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, non-inferiority study that compared oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol). ) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. In parallel, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous disease. Blood clots. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding in the initial treatment study and major bleeding in the maintenance study. The rivaroxaban study for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy for the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], versus 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.04; p <0.001). Major safety outcomes occurred in 8.1% of patients in each group. In the Continuation Treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 patients in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%), versus 42 with placebo (7.1%); hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; p < 0.001. Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P = 0.11). Rivaroxaban offers a simple, single-drug approach to short-term, continuous treatment of venous thrombosis that may improve the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation.

23991658	Whether the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban can be an alternative to warfarin in patients with venous thromboembolism is unclear. In a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study, we randomly assigned patients with acute venous thromboembolism, who initially received heparin, to receive edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg once daily, or 30 mg once daily (eg, in patients Those with a creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 ml per minute or a body weight of less than 60 kg), or to receive warfarin. Patients received the study drug for 3 to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome was non-major or clinically relevant bleeding. There were a total of 4921 patients with deep vein thrombosis and 3319 with pulmonary embolism. Among patients receiving warfarin, time in therapeutic range was 63.5%. Edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary efficacy outcome, which occurred in 130 patients in the edoxaban group (3.2%) and 146 patients in the warfarin group (3.5%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.13). ; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority). Safety outcomes occurred in 349 patients (8.5%) in the edoxaban group and 423 patients (10.3%) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.94; P = 0.004 for superiority). Rates of other adverse events were similar in the two groups. A total of 938 patients with pulmonary embolism had right ventricular dysfunction, as assessed by measuring N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels; The rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism in this subgroup was 3.3% in the edoxaban group and 6.2% in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.98). Once-daily administration of edoxaban after initial heparin therapy was noninferior to standard HD therapy and caused significantly less bleeding in a wide range of patients with venous thromboembolism, including those with acute pulmonary embolism.

8594425	Patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis are usually first treated in a hospital with standard (unfractionated) heparin intravenously. However, the longer plasma half-life, better bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, and more predictable anticoagulant response to lower molecular weight heparins make them attractive for potential home use. We compare these two approaches. Patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis were randomized to receive either standard heparin intravenously in the hospital (253 patients) or low-molecular-weight heparin (1 mg enoxaparin per kilogram of body weight subcutaneously twice daily) given primarily at home. (1 mg of enoxaparin per kilogram of body weight subcutaneously twice daily (247 patients). The study design allowed outpatients taking low-molecular-weight heparin to go home immediately and hospitalized patients taking low-molecular-weight heparin to be discharged early. All patients received warfarin starting on day 2. Thirteen of 247 patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin (5.3 percent) had recurrent thromboembolism, compared with 17 of 253 patients receiving standard heparin (6.7 percent; P = 0.57; absolute difference, 1.4 percentage points; confidence interval 95 percent). , -3.0 to 5.7). Five patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin had major bleeding, compared with three patients receiving standard heparin. After randomization, patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin spent an average of 1.1 days in the hospital, compared with 6.5 days for the standard heparin group; 120 patients in the low-molecular-weight heparin group did not require hospitalization at all. Low molecular weight heparin can be used safely and effectively to treat patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis at home.	Deep Vein Thrombosis		Warfarin		0
15758007	Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients remains underutilized. We hypothesized that use of a computer alert program to encourage prophylaxis may reduce the frequency of deep vein thrombosis among high-risk hospitalized patients. We developed a computer program linked to a patient database to identify consecutive hospitalized patients at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis in the absence of prophylaxis. The program used medical record numbers to randomly assign 1,255 eligible patients to an intervention group, in which the responsible physician was alerted to the patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis, and 1,251 patients to a control group, in which no alert was issued. The physician was required to acknowledge the alert and could then withhold or order prophylaxis, including graduated compression stockings, pneumatic compression shoes, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or warfarin. The primary endpoint was clinically diagnosed, objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 90 days. More patients in the intervention group than in the control group received mechanical prophylaxis (10.0 percent vs. 1.5 percent, P < 0.001) or drug prophylaxis (23.6 percent vs. 13.0 percent, P < 0.001). The primary endpoint occurred in 61 patients (4.9 percent) in the intervention group, compared with 103 (8.2 percent) in the control group; Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of freedom from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days were 94.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 92.5 to 95.4 percent) and 90.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88.7 to 92.2 percent), respectively (P< 0.001). Computer stimulation reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism by 41 percent over 90 days (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81; P = 0.001). The creation of a computer alert program increased physicians' use of prophylaxis and significantly reduced rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients at risk.

28902590	Whether closure of the foramen ovale reduces the risk of stroke recurrence in patients who have had a stroke of unknown origin is unknown. In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with adjudication blinded to endpoint events, we randomly assigned patients aged 18 to 60 years who had a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and had an ischemic stroke of unknown origin to undergo foramen ovale closure. PFO (PFO closure group) or receiving medical therapy alone (aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole; medical therapy group). The primary efficacy endpoint was the combination of recurrent nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal ischemic stroke, or early death after randomization. Results of the primary outcome analysis from the original trial period have been reported previously; The present analysis of data from the extended follow-up period was considered exploratory. We enrolled 980 patients (mean age 45.9 years) at 69 sites. Patients were followed for an average of 5.9 years. The treatment exposure in the two groups was unequal (3141 patient years in the PFO closure group versus 2669 patient years in the medical therapy group), due to a higher dropout rate in the medical therapy group. In the treatment target population, recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 18 patients in the PFO closure group and in 28 patients in the medical therapy group, resulting in rates of 0.58 events per 100 patient-years and 1.07 events per 100 patient-years. years, respectively (hazard ratio with PFO closure versus medical therapy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.999; P = 0.046 by log-rank test). Recurrent ischemic stroke of undetermined cause occurred in 10 patients in the PFO closure group and in 23 patients in the medical therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.79; P = 0.007). Venous thromboembolism (which included pulmonary embolism events and deep vein thrombosis) was more common in the PFO-closed group than in the medical therapy group. Among adults who had an ischemic stroke of unknown origin, PFO closure was associated with a lower rate of recurrent ischemic strokes compared with medical therapy alone during extended follow-up.

17337887	Individuals who have had a transient ischemic attack and stroke are at high risk of recurrent stroke and death. While acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) has been established and accepted as standard treatment in these patients, recent trials have shown that a combination of ASA and dipyridamole (DP) or clopidogrel may be superior to ASA. Blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may also reduce recurrent stroke. The PROFESS (Prevention System to Effectively Avoid Second Strokes) trial was designed to evaluate whether extended-release ASA + DP compared with clopidogrel, and whether telmisartan in addition to usual care for individuals after stroke, will reduce the risk of further strokes. PROFESS is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial including 695 sites from 35 countries or regions. Patients over 50 years of age who had an ischemic stroke of less than 120 days of age and who were stable were randomized. The primary outcome of the trial is recurrent stroke, using time-to-event analysis. The most important secondary outcome is stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Other secondary outcomes include this combination + congestive heart failure, new-onset diabetes, and other specific vascular occlusive events (pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion, transient ischemic attack, cerebral venous thrombosis, or retinal vascular accident not classified). As a stroke), any death, or a subtype of stroke according to the TOAST criteria and the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Safety is evaluated by assessing the risk of major bleeding events. The comparison between ASA + DP and clopidogrel is based on an initial non-inferiority assessment, followed by a superiority assessment, while for telmisartan, we will evaluate its superiority over placebo. With more than 20,000 patients randomized, and using a 2 × 2 factorial design, PROFESS is the largest stroke trial to investigate the prevention of recurrent stroke. The mean age was 66.1 +/- 8.6 years, and 36.0% of patients were female. The median time from qualifying event to randomization was 15 days with 39.9% of patients randomized within 10 days. According to the TOAST criteria, 28.5% of strokes were due to large vessel disease, 52.1% were due to small vessel disease, 1.8% were due to cardioembolism, 2.0% were due to other specified etiology, and 15.5% were due to undetermined etiology. . PROFESS is the largest secondary stroke prevention trial to date and will directly compare two antiplatelet regimens as well as the benefit of telmisartan versus placebo.

22441640	The risk of bleeding complications during and after early hip fracture surgery has not been established for patients taking clopidogrel and other anticoagulants. The purpose of this study is to evaluate perioperative bleeding risks and clinical outcomes after early hip fracture surgery in patients taking clopidogrel (Plavix) and other oral anticoagulants. The study design is a retrospective cohort analysis using data extracted from hospital records and government death registries. Regional Medical Center (Level II Trauma). Data on 1118 patients aged ≥60 years who underwent surgical treatment for hip fracture between 2004 and 2008 were reviewed. Eighty-two patients undergoing late surgery (>3 days after admission) were excluded. Patients taking clopidogrel were compared with those not taking clopidogrel. In addition, patients taking clopidogrel only were compared with groups of patients taking clopidogrel and aspirin, aspirin only, warfarin only, or no anticoagulants. Seventy-four of 1036 patients (7%) were taking clopidogrel, although the control groups included 253 patients taking aspirin alone, 90 patients taking warfarin, and 619 patients not taking anticoagulants. No statistically significant differences were observed between patients taking clopidogrel and those not taking clopidogrel in estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, final blood count, hematoma evacuation, hospital length of stay (LOS), or mortality. While they are in the hospital or after one year. A higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score was seen in the clopidogrel and warfarin groups (P = 0.05 for each), an increased LOS in the clopidogrel group (P = 0.05), and a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis in those patients taking warfarin (P = 0.05). 0.05). Clopidogrel alone versus aspirin versus both aspirin and clopidogrel, versus no anticoagulant versus warfarin, showed no significant differences in estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, final blood counts, bleeding, perioperative complications, or mortality. Patients undergoing early hip fracture surgery who take clopidogrel, aspirin, or warfarin (with an internationally regulated normalized ratio) are not at increased risk of bleeding, bleeding complications, or death. Comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores were significantly higher in the clopidogrel group, which may lead to increased postoperative visual loss in this group.

19838770	Several newer anticoagulants are in clinical development. Two of them recently, Dabigatran etexilate/Pradaxa. Rivaroxaban/Xarelto has marketing authorization in Europe and Canada for the prevention of thromboembolic events after major orthopedic surgery such as total hip and knee replacement. Results of phase III clinical studies in thromboprophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery are highlighted and discussed in detail. Ongoing phase II and III clinical trials are evaluating its effectiveness in the prevention and secondary treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, in the long-term prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with aspirin and clopidogrel. With acute coronary syndromes. Several other anticoagulant small molecules, including a new generation of low-molecular-weight heparin, are currently in various stages of clinical development. In addition to oral administration, newer anticoagulants have a more balanced benefit/risk ratio and a wider therapeutic window. They have a rapid onset of action, a predictable anticoagulant effect and do not require routine laboratory monitoring. They have minor interactions with food and drugs, including interactions with cytochrome P450 and P.gp. They are highly specific, target a single clotting factor, and can carry a similar or lower bleeding risk compared to older anticoagulant agents. Finally, it can be used in a wide range of patients, especially patients with advanced cancer, the elderly without any dose adjustment, regardless of the patient's age, sex or body weight or in patients with mild renal impairment. It is hoped that its use in the general world will confirm the promising results of clinical trials.	Deep Vein Thrombosis		Clopidogrel		0
15743917	Allopurinol, a drug commonly prescribed to treat gout and hyperuricemia, is a frequent cause of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), which include drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Adverse events are unpredictable and carry significant morbidity and mortality. To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-SCAR, we performed a case-control association study. We enrolled 51 allopurinol-SCAR patients and 228 control subjects (135 allopurinol-tolerant subjects and 93 healthy subjects from the general population), and genotyped 823 SNPs in genes associated with drug metabolism and immune response. The initial screen revealed a strong association between allopurinol-SCAR and SNPs in the MHC region, including BAT3 (encoding HLA-B associated transcript 3), MSH5 (mutS Homolog 5), and MICB (MHC class B polypeptide-binding sequence) ( P) < 10(-7)). We next identified HLA loci A, B, C, and DRB1 alleles. The HLA-B*5801 allele was present in all 51 (100%) patients with allopurinol-SCAR, but only in 20 (15%) of the 135 tolerant patients [odds ratio, 580.3 (95% confidence interval, 34.4-9780.9 ); corrected P value = 4.7 × 10(-24)] and in 19 (20%) of 93 healthy subjects [393.51 (23.23-6665.26); Corrected P value = 8.1 × 10(-18)]. HLA A*3303, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301 alleles were in linkage disequilibrium and formed an extended haplotype with HLA-B*5801. Our results indicated that allopurinol-SCAR is strongly associated with genetic predisposition in Han Chinese. In particular, the HLA-B*5801 allele is an important genetic risk factor for this life-threatening condition.	Gout		Allopurinol		1
16707532	Develop evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout. The multidisciplinary guideline development group consisted of 19 rheumatologists and one expert in evidence-based medicine representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on governance were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. The research evidence was systematically searched for each proposal. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was graded according to the level of evidence. Strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using EULAR analog and ordinal scales. 12 major propositions were generated after three rounds of Delphi. The proposals included both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and addressed the control of acute gout symptoms, urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and prevention of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, adverse lifestyle modification (weight loss in obesity, reduced alcohol consumption, low animal purine diet) and treatment of comorbidities and associated risk factors is emphasized. Recommended medications for acute attacks were oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% CI, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and corticosteroid injections. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. The long-term effectiveness of allopurinol for lowering urate levels was confirmed (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitization, or increased uric acid. Benzbromarone uric acid is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, diuretics should be discontinued if possible. To prevent acute attacks, colchicine 0.5-1 mg daily or NSAIDs (with gastric protection if necessary) are recommended. 12 key recommendations for the management of gout have been developed, using a combination of research-based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and an SOR was provided for each proposal.	Gout		Allopurinol		1
16339094	Febuxostat, a new selective nonpurinyl xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a potential alternative to allopurinol for patients with hyperuricemia and gout. We randomly assigned 762 patients with gout and blood urate concentrations of at least 8.0 mg per deciliter (480 μmol per liter) to receive either febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg) or allopurinol (300 mg) once daily for 52 weeks; 760 received study medication. Prophylaxis against gout attacks was provided with naproxen or colchicine during weeks 1 through 8. The primary endpoint was a serum urate concentration of less than 6.0 mg per deciliter (360 μmol per liter) at the last three monthly measurements. Secondary endpoints included a reduction in the incidence of gout attacks and in the area of ​​tophi. The primary endpoint was reached in 53% of patients receiving 80 mg febuxostat, 62% of those receiving 120 mg febuxostat, and 21% of patients receiving allopurinol (P < 0.001 to compare each febuxostat group with the allopurinol group). . Although the incidence of gout attacks diminished as treatment continued, the overall incidence during weeks 9 to 52 was similar in all groups: 64% of patients receiving 80 mg febuxostat, 70% of those receiving 120 mg febuxostat. , and 64% of those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat. Receiving allopurinol (P = 0.99 for 80 mg febuxostat versus allopurinol; P = 0.23 for 120 mg febuxostat versus allopurinol). The mean reduction in tophi area was 83 percent in patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat and 66 percent in those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, compared with 50 percent in those receiving allopurinol (P = 0.08 for 80 mg of febuxostat versus allopurinol; P =0.16 for 120 mg febuxostat versus allopurinol). More patients in the high-dose febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (P = 0.003) or the low-dose febuxostat group discontinued the study. Four of the 507 patients in the two groups died on febuxostat (0.8 percent) and none of the 253 patients in the allopurinol group died. All deaths were due to causes that the investigators (while still blind to treatment) considered unrelated to the study medications (P = 0.31 for comparison between the combined febuxostat and allopurinol groups). Febuxostat, at a daily dose of 80 mg or 120 mg, was more effective than allopurinol at the commonly used fixed daily dose of 300 mg in lowering serum urate. Similar reductions in gout flares and tophi area occurred in all treatment groups.	Gout		Allopurinol		1
16507884	The prototypical xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor, allopurinol, has been the cornerstone of the clinical management of gout and associated conditions of hyperuricemia for several decades. More recent data suggest that XO also plays an important role in various forms of vascular ischemia and other types of tissue and vascular injuries, inflammatory diseases, and chronic heart failure. Allopurinol and its active metabolite oxypurinol have shown great promise in treating these conditions both in laboratory animals and in small-scale human clinical trials. Although some of the beneficial effects of these compounds may not be related to XO inhibition, the encouraging results have sparked great interest in developing new additional series of XO inhibitors for various therapeutic indications. Here we provide a critical overview of the effects of XO inhibitors in various pathophysiological conditions and also review the various emerging therapeutic strategies offered by this approach.

15457467	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in people with primary fibromyalgia, with or without coexisting major depressive disorder. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 outpatient research centers in the United States. A total of 207 subjects meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for primary fibromyalgia were enrolled (89% female, 87% white, mean age 49 years, 38% with current major depressive disorder). After single-blind placebo treatment for 1 week, subjects were randomly assigned to receive duloxetine 60 mg twice a day (n = 104) or placebo (n = 103) for 12 weeks. Co-primary outcome measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score (score range 0–80, with 0 indicating no effect) and FIQ pain score (score range 0–10). Secondary outcome measures included mean pain threshold at pain point, number of pain scores, FIQ fatigue, fatigue on awakening, stiffness scores, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity), and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) scale. Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Quality of Life Depression Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale. Compared with subjects treated with placebo, duloxetine-treated subjects improved significantly (P = 0.027) on the FIQ total score, with a treatment difference of -5.53 (95% CI -10.43, -0.63), but not significantly more on the FIQ score. Pain recurred (P = 0.130). Compared with subjects treated with placebo, subjects treated with duloxetine had significantly greater reductions in the average Brief Pain Inventory pain intensity score (P = 0.008), the average Brief Pain Inventory pain intensity score (P = 0.004), and the number Pain score (P = 0.002), FIQ stiffness score (P = 0.048), and there was a significantly greater improvement in the mean pain threshold of the pain score (P = 0.002), CGI severity score (P = 0.048), and PGI improvement ( P = 0.033), and several quality of life measures, duloxetine treatment showed improvement in fibromyalgia symptoms and pain severity regardless of underlying major depressive disorder status (n = 92). 92) showed significantly greater improvement on most efficacy measures, while males treated with duloxetine (n=12) failed to improve significantly on any efficacy measure. The effect of treatment on significant pain reduction in females was independent of the effect on mood or anxiety Given safely and well-tolerated in this 12-week randomized controlled trial (with a 1-week placebo phase), duloxetine was an effective and safe treatment for several symptoms associated with fibromyalgia in people with and without the disorder. Major depression, especially for women. , which had significant improvement in most outcome measures.	Fibromyalgia		Duloxetine		1
16298061	This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in 354 female patients with primary fibromyalgia, with or without coexisting major depressive disorder. Patients (90% Caucasian; mean age, 49.6 years; 26% with current major depressive disorder) received duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD) (n = 118), or duloxetine 60 mg twice daily (BID) (n = 116), or placebo (n = 120). The primary outcome was the average pain intensity score on the Brief Pain Inventory. Response to treatment was defined as > or = 30% reduction in this outcome. Compared with placebo, both duloxetine-treated groups improved significantly (P < 0.001) in their average pain intensity score on the Brief Pain Inventory. A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with duloxetine had a > or = 30% reduction in this outcome (duloxetine 60 mg QD (55%; P < 0.001); duloxetine 60 mg BID (54%; P = 0.002); placebo ( 54%; P = 0.002); The effect of duloxetine treatment on pain reduction was independent of the effect on mood and the presence of major depressive disorder. Compared with patients who took placebo, patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg QD or duloxetine 60 mg twice daily had significantly greater improvement in the Brief Pain Inventory residual pain severity and interference scores, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Clinical Global Impression of Disease Severity, and the Impression Patient's global assessment of improvement, and many quality of life measures. Both doses of duloxetine were administered safely and well tolerated. In conclusion, both duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID were effective and safe in the treatment of fibromyalgia in female patients with and without major depressive disorder.

18395345	The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duloxetine for reducing pain intensity in fibromyalgia patients with and without coexisting major depressive disorder. This was a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In total, 520 patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to duloxetine (20 mg/day, 60 mg/day, or 120 mg/day) or placebo, given once daily for 6 months ( After 3 months, the duloxetine group (20 mg/day) was titrated to 60 mg/day). Co-primary outcome measures were the average Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain intensity score and the Patient Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Safety was assessed by treatment-induced adverse events, changes in vital signs, laboratory, and ECG measurements. Compared with patients treated with placebo, those patients treated with duloxetine 120 mg/day significantly improved on combined primary outcome measures after 3 months (change in BMI score [-2.31 vs -1.39, P<0.001] and PGI-I [ -] 2.89 vs. 3.39, P = 0.004]) and after 6 months (change in BPI [-2.26 vs -1.43, P = 0.003] and PGI-I [2.93 vs. 3.37, P = 0.012]). Compared with placebo, treatment with duloxetine 60 mg/day resulted in significant improvement in the combined primary measures at 3 months and the blood pressure index at 6 months. Duloxetine has been effective in patients with and without major depressive disorder. There were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups in changes in vital signs, laboratory measurements, or ECG measurements. Study results show that duloxetine at doses of 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day appears safe and effective in patients with fibromyalgia.	Fibromyalgia		Duloxetine		1
24385423	Duloxetine is a balanced serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor licensed for the treatment of major depressive disorders, stress urinary incontinence, and the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A number of trials have been performed to investigate the use of duloxetine in neuropathic and nociceptive painful conditions. This is the first update of a review first published in 2010. To evaluate the benefits and harms of duloxetine for the treatment of painful neuropathy and different types of chronic pain. On 19 November 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Group Specialist Register, CENTRAL, DARE, HTA, NHSEED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials in April 2013. We also searched reference lists of publications identifying trials of duloxetine for the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathy or chronic pain. We selected all randomized or quasi-randomized trials of any combination of duloxetine used to treat painful peripheral neuropathy or chronic pain in adults. We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We identified 18 trials, which included 6407 participants. We found 12 such studies in the literature looking for this update. Eight studies included a total of 2728 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy and six studies included 2249 participants with fibromyalgia. Three studies included participants with depression and painful physical symptoms and one included participants with central neuropathic pain. Studies were mostly at low risk of bias, although large dropouts, inclusion methods, and almost every study conducted or sponsored by the drug manufacturer increase the risk of bias in some areas. Duloxetine at a dose of 60 mg daily is effective in the short-term treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, with a risk ratio (RR) for ≥50% pain reduction at 12 weeks of 1.73 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.08). The relevant NNTB is 5 (95% CI 4 to 7). Duloxetine at a dose of 60 mg daily is also effective in treating fibromyalgia over 12 weeks (RR for pain reduction ≥ 50% 1.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.06; NNTB 8, 95% CI 4 to 21) and over 28 weeks (RR NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 14) as well as for painful somatic symptoms in depression (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.27). There was no effect on central neuropathic pain in one small, high-quality trial. In all cases, adverse events were common in both the treatment and placebo arms but more common in the treatment arm, with a dose-dependent effect. Most adverse effects were minor, but 16% of participants stopped taking the medication due to adverse effects. Serious adverse events were rare. There are sufficient amounts of moderate quality evidence from eight studies conducted by the manufacturers of duloxetine that doses of 60 mg and 120 mg daily are effective in treating pain in diabetic peripheral neuropathy but that lower daily doses are not. There is no need for further experiments. In fibromyalgia, there is less good evidence that duloxetine is effective at doses similar to those used in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and with a similar magnitude of effect. The effect in fibromyalgia may be achieved through greater improvement in mental symptoms compared to physical pain. There is low to moderate quality evidence that pain relief is also achieved in pain associated with depressive symptoms, but an NNTB of 8 in fibromyalgia and depression is not an indicator of significant efficacy. Further trials (preferably independent investigator-led studies) are needed in these indications to reach the optimal amount of information to make convincing decisions about effectiveness. Minor side effects are common and are more common with duloxetine 60 mg and especially with 120 mg daily, more than 20 mg daily, but serious side effects are rare. Improved direct comparisons between duloxetine with other antidepressants and with other drugs, such as pregabalin, which have already been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain, would be appropriate. Unbiased economic comparisons would aid decision making further, but there is no high-quality study that includes economic data.	Fibromyalgia		Duloxetine		1
27959717	Peripheral artery disease is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis with associated adverse cardiovascular and extremity events. Data from previous trials have indicated that patients receiving clopidogrel monotherapy have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with those receiving aspirin. We wanted to compare clopidogrel with ticagrelor, a powerful antiplatelet agent, in patients with peripheral artery disease. In this double-blind, event-based trial, we randomly assigned 13,885 patients with symptomatic PAD to receive monotherapy with ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). Patients were eligible if they had an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.80 or less or had undergone previous lower extremity revascularization. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Median follow-up was 30 months. The average age of patients was 66 years, and 72% were men; 43% were enrolled on the basis of ABI and 57% on the basis of previous revascularization. The mean baseline ABI in all patients was 0.71, 76.6% of patients had claudication, and 4.6% had critical limb ischemia. The primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 751 of 6930 patients (10.8%) who received ticagrelor and in 740 of 6955 (10.6%) who received clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.13; P = 0.65). . In each group, acute limb ischemia occurred in 1.7% of patients (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.33; P=0.85) and major bleeding in 1.6% (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.43). ; P = 0.49). In patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, ticagrelor has not been shown to be superior to clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular events. Major bleeding occurred at similar rates between patients in the two trial groups. (Funded by AstraZeneca; EUCLID ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01732822.).	Peripheral Artery Disease		Clopidogrel		1
16449620	Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately 20% of adults over the age of 55 years and is a strong predictor of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from vascular causes. The goals of treatment are to prevent future major coronary and cerebrovascular events and improve leg symptoms. To review the best evidence for medical treatment of peripheral artery disease. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database were searched from 1990 to November 2005 for randomized trials and meta-analyses of medical treatments for peripheral artery disease. References from these articles were also searched. Search terms, individually or in combination, included: peripheral arterial disease, peripheral artery disease, PAD, randomized controlled trial, randomized controlled trial, and meta-analysis. Particular attention has been directed toward randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of clinically relevant medical treatments for peripheral artery disease. Outcome measures included leg symptoms (intermittent claudication and walking distance), death, and major coronary and cerebrovascular events. Leg claudication symptoms, walking distance, and quality of life can be improved by smoking cessation (doctor's advice, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion), a structured exercise program, statins, cilostazol, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The risk of major coronary and cerebrovascular events can be reduced by lowering blood pressure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs, use of statins, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel, and possibly by smoking cessation. The large and increasing burden of peripheral artery disease, and its local and systemic complications, can be reduced by lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, exercise) and medical treatments (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, antihypertensive drugs, statins, and antiplatelet drugs).

18838564	Incomplete inhibition of platelet thromboxane synthesis, as measured by elevated urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) concentrations, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine the external validity of this association in aspirin-treated patients enrolled in the Clopidogrel for High Atherosclerosis Risk and Ischemia Stabilization, Management and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial and to determine whether there are any modifiable factors or interventions that lead to lowering urate. Dehydrothromboxane B(2) concentrations can thus reduce cardiovascular risk. 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) concentrations were measured in 3261 aspirin-treated patients at least 1 month after they were randomized to placebo or clopidogrel. Baseline urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) concentrations in the highest quartile were associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death compared with the lowest quartile (adjusted hazard ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.61, P = 0.03). . Increasing age, female sex, history of peripheral artery disease, current smoking, and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or oral hypoglycemia were independently associated with increased urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) concentrations, while aspirin dose > or = 150 mg/d, history of treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, history of hypercholesterolemia, and statin therapy were associated with lower concentrations. Randomization to clopidogrel (versus placebo) did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients in the highest quartile of urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) levels. In patients treated with aspirin, urinary concentrations of 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) are a valid, externally modifiable determinant of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death in patients at risk for atherothrombotic events.

22315275	This guideline focuses on anticoagulant drug therapies for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as for the relief of lower extremity symptoms and critical ischemia in people with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The methods for this guideline follow those described in the Methodology for the Development of Anticoagulant Therapy and Thromboprophylaxis: Anticoagulant Therapy and Thrombosis Prophylaxis, Ninth Edition: Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians in this supplement. Our top 20 recommendations are as follows. In patients aged ≥ 50 years with asymptomatic peripheral artery disease or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, we suggest aspirin (75-100 mg/day) without treatment (Grade 2b) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. For secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (including patients before and after peripheral artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), we recommend long-term aspirin (75-100 mg/day). or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) (Grade 1A). We recommend that warfarin not be used in addition to aspirin in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (grade 1b). For patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting, we suggest single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual therapy (grade 2C). For patients with refractory claudication despite exercise therapy and smoking cessation, we suggest adding cilostazol (100 mg per day) to aspirin (75-100 mg per day) or clopidogrel (75 mg per day) (Grade 2C). In patients with critical limb ischemia and rest pain who are unable to undergo revascularization, we suggest the use of prostanoids (grade 2C). In patients with acute limb ischemia due to acute thrombosis or embolism, we recommend surgery to treat peripheral arterial thrombosis (Grade 1B). Recommendations continue to favor individualized antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in most patients with asymptomatic PAD, symptomatic PAD, and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional treatments to relieve extremity symptoms should be considered only after exercise therapy, smoking cessation, and evaluation of peripheral artery revascularization.

21324428	Bleeding, a common complication of treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is associated with worse outcomes. The contemporary model of major bleeding associated with AMI treatment can stratify patients at high risk of bleeding and is essential for adjusting AMI practice and outcomes. Using the Acute Coronary Intervention and Treatment Outcomes Network-Get Guidelines database (ACTION Registry-GWTG), an in-hospital major bleeding risk model was developed in a cohort of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. High segment - myocardial infarction. The model used only baseline variables and was developed (n = 72,313) and validated (n = 17,960) in patients with AMI (at 251 US centers from January 2007 to December 2008). The 12 most statistically and clinically significant variables were combined in the final regression model. Calibration plots are shown, and model discrimination is shown across the derivation and validation sets, as well as across the major subsets. The major bleeding rate in the overall population was 10.8%. The 12 factors associated with major bleeding in the model were heart rate, baseline hemoglobin, female sex, baseline serum creatinine, age, ECG changes, heart failure or shock, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, body weight, and systolic blood pressure. And home warfarin. Uses. The model discriminated risks well in the derivation (C-statistic = 0.73) and validation (C-statistic = 0.71) cohorts. The risk score for major bleeding corresponded well to significant bleeding: very low risk (3.9%), low risk (7.3%), moderate risk (16.1%), high risk (29.0%), and very high risk (39.8%). In conclusion, the ACTION Registry-GWTG hospital major bleeding model stratifies the risk of major bleeding using variables at presentation and enables risk-adjusted bleeding outcomes for quality improvement initiatives and clinical decision making.

17635734	The combination of anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone in the initial and long-term management of acute coronary syndromes but increases the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy is often combined with oral anticoagulants in patients who have an indication for warfarin therapy (eg, atrial fibrillation) and who also have an indication for antiplatelet therapy (eg, coronary artery disease) but the suitability of such an approach is not yet resolved. Anticoagulation appears to be as effective as antiplatelet therapy in the long-term management of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and possibly peripheral artery disease, but causes more bleeding. Therefore, in those patients who develop atrial fibrillation, a switch from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulants may be all that is needed. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy has been shown to provide additional benefit compared with anticoagulants alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not as effective as oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, while the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than oral anticoagulants in patients with coronary stenting. Whether the benefits of triple therapy outweigh the risks in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stenting requires evaluation in randomized trials.	Peripheral Artery Disease		Warfarin		0
24302273	Vascular disease is included in the risk scoring system for predicting stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). This post-hoc analysis of ROCKET AF aims to determine the absolute rates of stroke and bleeding, and the relative efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in patients with and without peripheral artery disease (PAD). Peripheral artery disease was defined in the case report form as the presence of intermittent claudication, amputation due to arterial insufficiency, endovascular reconstruction, bypass surgery, percutaneous extremity intervention, or previously documented abdominal aortic aneurysm. The ROCKET AF trial was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled trial comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. A total of 839 (5.9%) patients in ROCKET AF had PAD. Patients with and without peripheral artery disease had similar rates of stroke or systemic embolism [HR: 1.04, 95% CI (0.72, 1.50), P = 0.84] and major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding (NMCR) [HR : 1.11, 95%) CI (0.96, 1.28), P = 0.17], respectively. The effectiveness of rivaroxaban when compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism was similar in patients with peripheral artery disease (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.63-2.22) and those without peripheral artery disease (HR: 0.86, CI). 95%: 0.73-1.02). Interaction F = 0.34). There was a significant interaction of major bleeding or NMCR bleeding in patients with peripheral artery disease treated with rivaroxaban compared with warfarin (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.06-1.86) compared with those without peripheral artery disease (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.06-1.86). 1.03, 95% CI: 0.95-1.11). Interaction P = 0.037). Patients with peripheral artery disease in ROCKET AF did not have a statistically significantly higher risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with patients without peripheral artery disease, and there were similar efficacy results in patients treated with rivaroxaban and warfarin. In PAD patients, there was a greater risk of major bleeding or NMCR bleeding with rivaroxaban compared with warfarin (interaction P = 0.037). Further investigation is warranted to validate this subgroup analysis and determine optimal treatment in this high-risk group of atrial fibrillation patients with PAD.

15930419	The management of warfarin therapy is complicated by the large inter-patient variability in response to the drug. Variants in the gene that encodes vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) may affect response to warfarin. We performed a retrospective study of European American patients receiving long-term warfarin maintenance therapy. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the effect of VKORC1 haplotypes on warfarin dose. We determined VKORC1 haplotype frequencies in African American, European American, and Asian American populations and VKORC1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in human liver samples. We identified 10 common VKORC1 non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms and deduced five major haplotypes. We defined the low-dose haplotype group (A) and the high-dose haplotype group (B). The mean (+/-SE) maintenance dose of warfarin differed significantly between the three haplotype group groups, at 2.7 +/- 0.2 mg per day for A/A, and 4.9 +/- 0.2 mg per day for A/B, and 6.2 +/- 0.3 mg daily for B/B (P < 0.001). VKORC1 haplotype groups A and B explained approximately 25 percent of the variation in dose. Asian Americans had a higher proportion of group A haplotypes, and African Americans had a higher proportion of group B haplotypes. VKORC1 mRNA levels vary according to haplotype group. VKORC1 haplotypes can be used to stratify patients into low-, medium-, and high-dose warfarin groups and may explain differences in dose requirements between patients of different ancestry. The molecular mechanism of warfarin dose response appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
14765194	Coumarin derivatives such as warfarin represent the treatment of choice for long-term treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. Coumarin targets blood clotting by inhibiting vitamin K multiprotein reductase (VKOR). This complex recycles vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K hydroquinone, an essential cofactor for the post-translational gamma carboxylation of many blood clotting factors. Despite extensive efforts, the components of the VKOR complex have not been identified. The complex has been proposed to be involved in two genetic human diseases: vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency type 2 (VKCFD2; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 607473), and resistance to coumarin-type anticoagulant drugs (warfarin). Resistivity, WR; OMIM 122700). Here we identify, using binding information from three species, subunit 1 of the vitamin K epoxide reductase gene (VKORC1), which encodes a small transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. VKORC1 contains missense mutations in both human disorders and in a warfarin-resistant mouse strain. Overexpression of wild-type VKORC1, but not VKORC1 carrying a VKCFD2 mutation, results in a marked increase in VKOR activity, which is sensitive to warfarin inhibition.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
15947090	Current dosing algorithms do not take into account genetic and environmental factors to determine the warfarin dose. This study investigated the contribution of age, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, and body size to warfarin dose requirements. The study included 297 patients with stable anticoagulation with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Genetic analyzes for CYP2C9 (*2 and *3 alleles) and VKORC1 (polymorphism -1639) were performed and intravenous INR and plasma R- and S-warfarin concentrations were determined. Mean daily warfarin dose requirements were highest in patients with the CYP2C9 homozygous wild-type, compared with those with the *2 and *3 variant alleles (P < .001) and highest in patients with the VKORC1 genotype. (position -1639) GG compared with those with the GA genotype and the AA genotype (P < .001). The average daily dose requirement of warfarin decreased by 0.5 to 0.7 mg per decade between ages 20 to 90 years. Age, height, and CYP2C9 genotype contributed significantly to S-warfarin clearance and complete warfarin clearance, whereas only age and body size significantly contributed to R-warfarin clearance. A multivariable regression model including the variables age, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, and height produced the best model for estimating warfarin dose (R2 = 55%). Based on the data, a new warfarin dosing regimen was developed. The dosing regimen was validated in a second group of patients receiving warfarin therapy.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
18305455	Initiating warfarin therapy using trial-and-error dosing is difficult. Our goal was to develop and validate a pharmacokinetic algorithm. In the derivation cohort of 1015 participants, independent predictors of therapeutic dose were: VKORC1 -1639/3673 G>A polymorphism (-28% per allele), body surface area (BSA) (+11% per 0.25 m(2)) , CYP2C9(*)3 (-33% per allele), CYP2C9(*)2 (-19% per allele), Age (-7% per decade), Target International Normalized Ratio (INR) (+11% per 0.5 units increase), amiodarone use (-22%), smoker status (+10%), race (-9%), and current coagulopathy (+7%). This pharmacokinetic equation explained 53–54% of the variance in warfarin dose in the derivation and validation cohorts (n = 292). For comparison, clinical equation explained only 17-22% of dose variance (P < 0.001). In the validation cohort, we prospectively used a drug dosing algorithm in patients who initiated warfarin therapy, two of whom had major bleeding. To facilitate the use of these pharmacological and clinical algorithms, we have developed a non-profit website, http://www.WarfarinDosing.org.		VKORC1	Warfarin		1
26984520	Pharmacogenetics offers the potential to improve health outcomes by identifying individuals most at risk of harm from certain drugs. Routine adoption of pharmaceutical tests requires evidence of their cost-effectiveness. The present review aims to systematically review published economic evaluations of drug tests aimed at preventing or reducing the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of drug tests aimed at reducing the incidence of adverse drug reactions. The literature was searched using Embase, MEDLINE and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database with search terms relating to drug tests, adverse drug reactions, economic evaluations and pharmaceuticals. Titles were screened independently by two reviewers. Articles considered to meet the inclusion criteria were independently screened for abstract and full texts. We identified 852 articles, of which 47 met inclusion criteria. There was evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of testing for HLA-B*57:01 (before abacavir), HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 (before carbamazepine), HLA-B*58:01 (before allopurinol) and CYP2C19. (Before treatment with clopidogrel). Economic evidence was inconclusive for TPMT (before treatment with 6-mercaptobutene, azathioprine, and cisplatin), CYP2C9 and VKORC1 (for informing genotype-guided dosing of coumarin derivatives), MTHFR (before treatment with methotrexate), and Factor V Leiden testing (before treatment with methotrexate). For oral contraception). Testing for A1555G is not cost-effective before prescribing aminoglycosides. Our systematic review identified strong evidence for the cost-effectiveness of pre-treatment genotyping with a number of common drugs. However, further analyzes and/or strong clinical evidence are necessary to make recommendations to others.		VKORC1	Abacavir		0

It focused on practical applications in routine medical practice. We provide practical recommendations for ten different clinical situations, both approved and unapproved by regulatory bodies. We suggest some notes that may accompany the results of these tests, which indicate the best medication and doses that should be prescribed.

19530963	Serious adverse drug reactions represent the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, are the leading cause of post-marketing drug withdrawal and represent costs in the billions of US dollars each year in all developed countries. Some of these serious adverse drug reactions can be avoided by systematic screening for drug genetic risk factors. Over the past few years, regulatory agencies have introduced pharmacogenomic labeling for many drugs, but although prior genetic testing remains recommended or recommended, it is rarely mandatory due to poor evidence-based medical knowledge. Recently published ongoing randomized controlled pharmacogenomic trials will gradually make genotyping tests, such as tests for HLA-B*5701 (abacavir), TPMT (6-mercaptopurine), CYP2C9 plus VKORC1 (warfarin), and CYP3A5 (tacrolimus), mandatory. The parallel development of pharmacogenomic bedside tests will certainly lead to the establishment of gene-based prescriptions in routine medical practice.		VKORC1	Abacavir		0
20487194	Pharmacogenomics seeks to explain interindividual variation in response to drugs due to genetic variation. Although technological advances have provided us with easy and relatively cheap methods for genotyping, the promise of personalized medicine has not yet met our high expectations. Successful results achieved in the field of pharmacogenomics to date are, but not limited to, HLA-B*5701 screening to avoid hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral abacavir, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping to avoid thiopurine toxicity, and CYP2C9 and CYP2C9. . VKORC1 genotyping for optimal dosing of the anticoagulant warfarin. However, there are few pharmacological examples that have entered clinical practice in the treatment of complex diseases. Unfortunately, the lack of reproducibility of observational studies involving many genes and diseases appears to be a common pattern in pharmacogenomics studies. In this article we address some methodological and statistical issues in study design, gene and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection, and data analysis that should be considered in future pharmacogenomics research. First, we discuss some issues related to the design of epidemiological studies, specific to pharmacogenomics research. Second, we describe some of the pros and cons of the candidate gene approach (including gene and SNP selection) and the genome-wide scanning approach. Finally, traditional and several innovative approaches have been proposed to analyze large pharmacogenomic datasets that address the issues of multiplexing and systems biology in different ways.

12222994	Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) is the major (or partial) cause of significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of a number of clinically important drugs. On the basis of their ability to metabolize (S)-mephenytoin or other CYP2C19 substrates, individuals can be classified as extensive metabolizers (EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs). Eight different alleles (CYP2C19*2 to CYP2C19*8) that predict PMs have been identified. The distribution of EM and PM genotypes and phenotypes shows wide differences between ethnicities. Non-genetic factors such as enzyme inhibition and induction, aging, and liver fibrosis can also modify CYP2C19 activity. In emergency settings, approximately 80% of doses of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole appear to be eliminated by CYP2C19, whereas CYP3A is more important in cases of PMs. Exposure to these drugs has been observed to be five-fold higher in PMs compared to EMs for CYP2C19, and further increases occur during inhibition of alternative metabolic pathways catalyzed by CYP3A in PMs. As a result, PMs of CYP2C19 have more effective acid suppression and better healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers during treatment with omeprazole and lansoprazole compared with EMs. The pharmacoeconomic value of CYP2C19 genotyping remains unclear. Our calculations suggest that genotyping for CYP2C19 could save approximately $5,000 for every 100 Asians tested, but nothing for Caucasian patients. However, genotyping for common alleles of CYP2C19 before initiating proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of reflux disease and H. pylori infection is a cost-effective tool to determine the appropriate duration of treatment regimens and dosing. Altered CYP2C19 activity does not appear to increase the risk of adverse drug reactions/proton pump inhibitor interactions. Phenytoin plasma concentrations and toxicity have been shown to be increased in patients taking CYP2C19 inhibitors or who have variant alleles, and because of its narrow therapeutic range, genotyping for CYP2C19 in addition to CYP2C9 may be needed to optimize the dose of phenytoin. The risk of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity may be increased in patients whose CYP2C19 and/or CYP2D6 activities are diminished. CYP2C19 is a key enzyme in the activation of proguanil to cycloguanil, but there are no clinical data to suggest that PMs of CYP2C19 are at greater risk for malaria prophylaxis or treatment failure. Diazepam clearance is clearly diminished in PMs or when CYP2C19 inhibitors are co-prescribed, but clinical consequences are generally minimal. Finally, several studies have attempted to determine relationships between CYP2C19 genotype and phenotype and susceptibility to diseases caused by xenobiotics, but none of these studies have been convincing.

18171251	Voriconazole is the treatment of choice for aspergillosis and a new treatment option for candidiasis. Liver disease, age, CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms, and comedic medications affect the metabolism of voriconazole. Significant differences in voriconazole pharmacokinetics may be associated with reduced efficacy or toxicity. This study was conducted to evaluate the utility of measuring voriconazole blood levels with individual dose adjustments. A total of 181 measurements using high-pressure liquid chromatography were performed during 2388 treatment days in 52 patients. Considerable variation in blood voriconazole levels has been observed, ranging from <or=1 mg/L (minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of isolates are susceptible to most fungal pathogens) in 25% of cases to >5.5 mg/L. L (level possibly associated with toxicity) in 31% of cases. Non-response to treatment was more common in patients with voriconazole levels < or = 1 mg/L (6 [46%] of 13 patients, including 5 patients with aspergillosis, 4 of whom were treated orally at a median dose of 6 mg/L). kg per day) compared with those with voriconazole levels > 1 mg/L (15 [12%] of 39 patients; P = .02). Blood levels >1 mg/L were achieved after voriconazole dose increases, with complete resolution of infection in all six cases. Among 16 patients with low blood voriconazole levels >5.5 mg/L, 5 patients (31%) developed encephalopathy, including 4 patients treated intravenously with a mean voriconazole dose of 8 mg/kg daily, while no None of the patients with levels < or = 5.5 mg/L presented with neurotoxicity (P = 0.002). Chemotherapy with omeprazole may have contributed to voriconazole accumulation in 4 patients. In all cases, discontinuation of treatment resulted in rapid and complete neurological recovery. Voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring improves the efficacy and safety of treatment in critically ill patients with invasive fungi.		CYP2C19	Omeprazole		0
16413245	Many drugs, including proton pump inhibitors and some antidepressants, are metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19. A significant portion of the broad-spectrum metabolites do not reach appropriate drug levels, and our goal was to investigate any genetic background. The 5'-flanking region of the CYP2C19 gene from subjects with rapid omeprazole metabolizers was sequenced, and the phenotype-genotype associations of CYP2C19 in Swedish (n = 107) and Ethiopian (n = 126) were analyzed in large-scale metabolizers. The relationship between the omeprazole metabolism ratio (omeprazole/5-hydroxy omeprazole in plasma 3 hours after drug administration) with the area under the plasma concentration-time curve has been used in prediction studies. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using human nuclear protein extracts. Liver reporter vector transfections were performed into CD1 mice. We identified a novel allele (CYP2C19*17) carrying -806C>T and -3402C>T, with a frequency of 18% in both Swedes and Ethiopians and 4% in Chinese subjects. In Swedes, the rate of metabolism of omeprazole was higher in subjects homozygous for CYP2C19*1 (median, 0.50 [interquartile range, 0.37-0.73]) than in those homozygous for CYP2C19*17 (median, 0.25 [interquartile range, 0.15-0.33]) ( P = .010). In Ethiopians, a similar difference in the S/R-mephenytoin ratio was observed between individuals homozygous for CYP2C19*1 (median, 0.20 [interquartile range, 0.12-0.37]) and those homozygous for CYP2C19*17 (median, 0.05 [interquartile range, 0.05] 0.03). -0.06]) (P = 0.013). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific binding of human hepatic nuclear proteins to a motif carrying -806T but not -806C. Reporter vector experiments demonstrated increased transcriptional activity of the CYP2C19*17 allele in vivo in mice. Projections revealed that CYP2C19*17 homozygotes would achieve 35% to 40% lower area under the plasma concentration-time curve values ​​than CYP2C19*1 homozygotes taking standard doses of omeprazole. CYP2C19*17 has the potential to cause therapeutic failure with drug therapy, for example, with proton pump inhibitors and antidepressants.		CYP2C19	Omeprazole		1
11678778	Human CYP2Cs are an important subfamily of P450 enzymes that metabolize approximately 20% of clinically used drugs. There are four members in the subfamily, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C18. Of these, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are of clinical importance. CYP2Cs also metabolize some endogenous compounds such as arachidonic acid. Every member of this subfamily has been found to be genetically polymorphic. The best known of these polymorphisms is in CYP2C19. Poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2C19 represent approximately 3-5% of Caucasians, a similar percentage of African Americans and 12-100% of Asian groups. The polymorphism affects the metabolism of the anticonvulsant agent mephenytoin, proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, the anxiolytic agent diazepam, some antidepressants, and the antimalarial drug proguanil. Toxic effects can occur in patients with PM exposed to diazepam, and the effectiveness of some proton pump inhibitors may be greater in PM than EM at low doses of these drugs. There are a number of mutant alleles that can be detected by genetic testing. CYP2C9 metabolizes a wide range of drugs including the anticoagulant warfarin, antidiabetic agents such as tolbutamide, anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The incidence of functional polymorphisms is much lower, estimated at 1/250 in Caucasians and lower in Asians. However, the clinical consequences of these rare polymorphisms can be severe. Severe, life-threatening bleeding events have been reported in CYP2C9 PM patients exposed to warfarin. Phenytoin has been reported to cause severe toxicity in PMs. New polymorphisms have been discovered in CYP2C8, which metabolizes Taxol (paclitaxel). Genetic testing is available for all known CYP2C alleles.		CYP2C19	Omeprazole		1
26984520	Pharmacogenetics offers the potential to improve health outcomes by identifying individuals most at risk of harm from certain drugs. Routine adoption of pharmaceutical tests requires evidence of their cost-effectiveness. The present review aims to systematically review published economic evaluations of drug tests aimed at preventing or reducing the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of drug tests aimed at reducing the incidence of adverse drug reactions. The literature was searched using Embase, MEDLINE and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database with search terms relating to drug tests, adverse drug reactions, economic evaluations and pharmaceuticals. Titles were screened independently by two reviewers. Articles considered to meet the inclusion criteria were independently screened for abstract and full texts. We identified 852 articles, of which 47 met inclusion criteria. There was evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of testing for HLA-B*57:01 (before abacavir), HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 (before carbamazepine), HLA-B*58:01 (before allopurinol) and CYP2C19.

20546557	During HIV infection and/or antiretroviral therapy (ART), monocytes and macrophages exhibit a wide range of dysfunctions that significantly contribute to HIV pathogenesis and treatment-related complications. However, the molecular components that contribute to these imbalances remain elusive. We therefore applied a parallel approach of genome-wide microarray analysis and focused gene expression profiling on monocytes from patients at different stages of HIV infection and/or ART to further characterize these dysfunctions. Processes involving apoptosis, cell cycle, lipid metabolism, proteasome function, protein trafficking and transcriptional regulation have been identified as areas of monocyte dysfunction during HIV infection. Individual genes potentially contributing to these monocyte imbalances included several novel factors. One of these is the adipocytokin NAMPT/visfatin, which we have shown is able to inhibit HIV at an early step in its life cycle. Approximately half of the identified genes were restored to control levels under ART, while the other genes represented persistent dysregulation. In addition, several candidate biomarkers (particularly CCL1 and CYP2C19) have been proposed for the development of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction. Previously described areas of monocyte dysfunction during HIV infection were confirmed, and new themes were identified. Furthermore, individual genes associated with these imbalances and disorders associated with ART have been identified. These genes form a useful basis for further functional studies regarding the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to HIV pathogenesis. One of these genes, NAMPT/visfatin, represents a potential new restriction factor for HIV.		CYP2C19	Abacavir		1
16170225	Pharmacogenomic studies contribute to our understanding of interindividual differences in response to antiretroviral drugs. Genetic polymorphisms in histocompatibility complex genes predict the likelihood of hypersensitivity reactions in people prescribed abacavir, and possibly nevirapine. Recent studies have shown that polymorphisms in the CYP2B6 gene are associated with higher efavirenz plasma concentrations and increased CNS side effects. Polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene that encodes the drug pump, P-glycoprotein, may predict nevirapine-associated hepatotoxicity and long-term virological response to efavirenz. CYP2C19 polymorphisms predict nelfinavir plasma levels and possibly the risk of virologic failure on this drug. The European Mitochondrial Haplogroup may predict an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Expanding and refining knowledge regarding associations between human genetics and response to antiretroviral drugs may eventually allow treatment to be personalized based on genotyping. This article summarizes a presentation on HIV therapeutics and pharmacogenomics given by David W. Haas, MD, at the International AIDS Society USA session in Atlanta in March 2005.

19700688	Many long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are natural ligands for non-ruminant peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which, along with their adipogenic target genes, are upregulated in bovine mammary tissue during lactation. Thus, PPARG may represent an important control point in bovine milk lipid synthesis. We tested the expression of the adipogenic gene network via quantitative PCR for 19 genes in bovine mammary epithelial cells cultured with 16:0, 18:0, cis-9 18:1, trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 18: 2[t10c12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)], 20:5, ethanol (control), and the PPARG agonist rosiglitazone (ROSI). Triplicate cultures were maintained for 12 h with 50 mM ROSI or 100 mM LCFA. Combined responses between 16:0 and 18:0 relative to control included significantly greater expression of INSIG1 (+298%, +92%), AGPAT6 (+137%, +169%), FABP3 (+755%, +338%), and FABP4 (+171%, 157%). This was coupled with greater intracellular lipid droplet formation and mRNA for ACSS2, LPIN1, SCD and SREBF2 in response to 16:0, and greater DGAT1 and THRSP at 18:0. Trans-10 18:1 and t10c12 CLA reduced the expression of FASN (-60%, -31%), SCD (-100%, -357%), and SREBF1 (-49%, -189%). Moreover, t10c12 CLA upregulated the expression of ACSS2, FABP3, INSIG1, SREBF2 and THRSP. Expression of SREBF1 was lower with cis-9 18:1 (-140%) and 20:5 (-125%) compared to control. This latter LCFA also reduced the expression of SCD, SREBF2, and LPL. No effects of LCFA or ROSI on PPARG were observed, but ROSI upregulated (+39% to +269%) the expression of ACACA, FASN, LPIN1, AGPAT6, DGAT1, SREBF1, SREBF2, and INSIG1. Thus, these genes are putative PPARG target genes in bovine mammary cells. This is the first report demonstrating the direct effect of trans-10 18:1 on adipogenic gene expression of bovine mammary cells. Coordinated regulation of adipogenic gene networks in response to ROSI and saturating LCFA provides support for PPARG activation in the regulation of bovine milk lipid synthesis.

21532596	In adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and macrophages, signaling by the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) is one of the determinants of insulin sensitivity and this receptor mediates the insulin-sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Because PPAR-γ is also expressed in neurons, we generated mice with neuron-specific Pparg knockout (brain Pparg knockout (BKO)) to determine whether neuronal PPAR-γ signaling contributes to weight gain or insulin sensitivity. During feeding with a high-fat diet (HFD), food intake was reduced and energy expenditure was increased in Pparg-BKO mice compared to Pparg(f/f) mice, resulting in reduced weight gain. Pparg-BKO mice also responded better to leptin administration compared to Pparg(f/f) mice. When treated with the TZD rosiglitazone, Pparg-BKO mice were resistant to rosiglitazone-induced hyperphagia and weight gain, and compared with rosiglitazone-treated Pparg(f/f) mice, only marginally improved glucose metabolism. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp studies showed that the increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity induced by rosiglitazone treatment during HFD feeding was completely abolished in Pparg-BKO mice, an effect associated with the failure of rosiglitazone to improve insulin receptor signal transduction in the liver. We conclude that weight gain induced by high-density feeding depends in part on the effect of neuronal PPAR-γ signaling to reduce thermogenesis and increase food intake. Neuronal PPAR-γ signaling is also required for the hepatic insulin-sensitizing effects of TZDs.		PPARG	Rosiglitazone		1
14517292	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is an important regulator of lipid and glucose homeostasis and cellular differentiation. Studies on many cell types in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that activation of PPAR gamma can reduce cell proliferation. Here we show that activation of PPAR gamma is sufficient to reduce the proliferation of cultured insulinoma cell lines. We created a model with mice in which expression of the PPARG gene in beta cells was knocked out (beta gamma KO mice), and these mice were found to have significant islet hypertrophy on a chow diet. Interestingly, the normal expansion of beta cell mass that occurs in control mice in response to high-fat feeding is markedly impaired in these animals. Despite this change in beta cell mass, no effect on glucose homeostasis was observed in beta gamma KO mice. In addition, while thiazolidinediones enhanced insulin secretion from cultured wild-type islets, administration of rosiglitazone to insulin-resistant control and beta-gamma KO mice revealed that PPAR gamma in beta cells is not required for the antidiabetic actions of these compounds. These data demonstrate an important physiological role for PPAR gamma function in beta cell proliferation and also suggest that the mechanisms controlling beta cell hypertrophy in obesity differ from those regulating basic islet cell mass.

20498072	Nocturnin (NOC) is a circadian-regulated protein associated with the yeast family of transcription factors involved in cellular response to nutrient status. In mammals, NOC functions as a deadenylase but lacks a transcriptional activation domain. It is highly expressed in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), hepatocytes, and adipocytes. In BMSCs exposed to PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) rosiglitazone, Noc expression was enhanced 30-fold. Previously, we reported that Noc(−/−) mice had low body temperature, were protected from diet-induced obesity, and most importantly showed an absence of the circadian rhythm Pparg on a high-fat diet. Consistent with its role in influencing the allocation of BMSCs, Noc(-/-) mice have reduced bone marrow adiposity and higher bone mass. In the same context, overexpression of NOC promotes adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells but negatively regulates osteogenesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. NOC and the mutant form, which lacks deadenylase activity, bind to PPAR-gamma and markedly enhance PPAR-gamma transcriptional activity. Both WT and mutant NOC facilitate nuclear translocation of PPAR-gamma. Importantly, NOC-mediated nuclear translocation of PPAR-gamma is blocked by a short peptide fragment of NOC that prevents its physical interaction with PPAR-gamma. The inhibitory effect of this NOC peptide was partially reversed by rosiglitazone, suggesting that the effect of NOC on nuclear translocation of PPAR-gamma may be independent of ligand-mediated PPAR-gamma activation. In summary, Noc plays a unique role in regulating mesenchymal stem cell lineage allocation by modulating PPAR-gamma activity through nuclear translocation. These data demonstrate a unique mechanism by which a nutrient-responsive gene affects BMSCs differentiation, adipogenesis, and ultimately body composition.		PPARG	Rosiglitazone		1
15052272	In this study we sought to test the hypothesis that genetic factors may influence antidepressant response to fluoxetine. The research focused on seven candidate genes in the serotonergic pathway involved in serotonin synthesis, transport, recognition and degradation. Our clinical sample consisted of 96 individuals with unipolar major depression treated with fluoxetine with response variables assessed after a 12-week trial. Patient data were also collected to investigate the pattern of response to medications. Using a high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platform and capillary electrophoresis, we genotyped patients at 110 SNPs and four repeat polymorphisms located in seven candidate genes (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, MAOA, SLC6A4, TPH1, and TPH2). Statistical tests performed included locus and haplotype linkage tests, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Little evidence of population stratification was observed in the sample containing 20 random SNPs using the genomic control procedure. Our most interesting results included three SNPs in the TPH1 gene and one SNP in the SLC6A4 gene, which showed a significant association at a single locus when fluoxetine response was compared to nonresponse (P = 0.02-0.04). All odds ratios indicated an increased risk of non-response to fluoxetine. In the specific response versus indeterminate and nonresponse comparison, three SNPs in the TPH2 gene (P = 0.02-0.04) were positively associated and one SNP in the HTR2A gene (P = 0.02) was negatively associated. When comparing a specific response to a non-specific response, we found significant negative associations in three SNPs in the HTR2A gene (P = 0.001-0.03) and two SNPs in the MAOA gene (P = 0.03-0.05). We observed a variant, despite strong LD, in each gene and unexpectedly low numbers of estimated haplotypes, which consisted of tagged polymorphisms. Significant haplotype associations were found in all genes except HTR1A and HTR2C. Although these data should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, these results suggest the involvement of TPH1 and SLC6A4 in the general response, and HTR2A, TPH2 and MAOA in the specificity of response to fluoxetine. Interestingly, we note that a number of less frequent alleles of several SNP markers were associated with non-responsive and indeterminate phenotypes.		SLC6A4	Fluoxetine		1
15993855	The serotonin transporter is the molecular target of many antidepressants, and the gene (SLC6A4) that encodes this protein has been associated with response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We sought to test the hypothesis that SLC6A4 is associated with SSRI response by re-identifying this gene in subjects with major depression. All exons, portions of all introns, and the promoter region containing the polymorphic repeat polymorphism (HTTLPR) polymorphism previously associated with SSRI response were sequenced for 96 subjects, and variants were tested for association with response to treatment with fluoxetine. We screened a total of 712 kilobases of sequence and found 27 SLC6A4 variants, 21 of which had not been previously described. Seventeen were seen on one chromosome each, including three of the five exonic variants. A polymorphism (rs25531), upstream of the HTTLPR, showed evidence of an association with response to treatment, and biochemical experiments showed that this polymorphism alters the binding of nuclear extracts to a consensus sequence of activating protein transcription factor 2, which is thought to be a transcription factor. A critical factor in the regulation of neuronal gene expression in mammals. These results support an association between response to SSRIs and deoxyribonucleic acid variation at the serotonin transporter locus. We have also identified an important functional variant potentially contributing to this association and a potential biological mechanism that could mediate its effect.		SLC6A4	Fluoxetine		1
9672904	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, intrusive, disturbing thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors or mental actions that a person feels driven to do (compulsions). OCD has a partly genetic basis. To treat OCD, strong serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medications (clomipramine (Anafranil), fluvoxamine (Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil)) are used, which act on the serotonin transport protein. Uniquely effective. A polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene (SLC6A4) encoding this protein has recently been reported to affect protein expression and be associated with measures of anxiety, depression, and autism (using a family-controlled transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) design). . SLC6A4 thus has strong prior support for a potential impact on OCD risk: the protein it encodes is a drug target; Polymorphisms in the gene affect function; Polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with behavioral patterns. We used TDT with a cohort of 34 European-American triplet families, 30 unrelated and four derived from extended pedigrees, to test for linkage disequilibrium between OCD and alleles at a polymorphic locus of the SLC6A4 promoter. Of the 35 heterozygous parents, 24 transmitted the SLC6A4 'l' allele and 11 transmitted the 's' allele (chi 2 TDT = 4.83; P < 0.03). Considering only the 13 SRI non-responders, there were 13 heterozygous parents, of whom 10 carried the 'l' allele and three the 's' allele (chi 2 TDT = 3.77; P < 0.052). These data provide preliminary support for linkage disequilibrium and association between the SLC6A4 'l' allele and OCD.		SLC6A4	Fluoxetine		1
21439906	Recent major findings from studies of SLC6A4 and its counterpart protein, serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) in humans, rodents and non-human primates indicate that combinations of SLC6A4 non-coding 5', 3' UTRs and intronic regions as well as coding variants that act together can Altered 5HT transport by up to 40-fold in vitro. In vivo, SLC6A4 variants in humans and other species lead to marked physiological changes, despite attenuation of neurodevelopmental adaptations in 5-HT receptors as well as compensatory alterations in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism. Polymorphisms in SLC6A4 are associated with differences in emotional, endocrine, and personality characteristics as well as several diseases. This gene, in combinations with gene × gene (G × G) and gene × environment (G × E) interactions, is still not fully understood, with some association results remaining controversial. Given their fundamental importance in the regulation and function of the entire serotonergic system (as demonstrated by the consequences of inhibition of SERT reuptake by SSRIs such as fluoxetine in humans and transgenic changes in mice and rats), it seems likely that SLC6A4 and SERT will remain areas of great interest in attempts to Our field is to better understand and treat 5-HT related disorders.

18256392	Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele. This study was designed to determine the potential effectiveness of screening for HLA-B*5701 to prevent hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. This randomized, double-blind study included 1,956 patients from 19 countries who were infected with HIV type 1 and who had not previously received abacavir. We randomly assigned patients to undergo prospective HLA-B*5701 screening, excluding HLA-B*5701-positive patients from abacavir treatment (prospective screening group), or to undergo the standard-of-care approach to abacavir without potential HLA-B*5701 screening (prospective screening group). Controller). All patients started on abacavir were observed for 6 weeks. To immunologically confirm and enhance the specificity of the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, we performed an epicutaneous patch test with abacavir. The prevalence of HLA-B*5701 was 5.6% (109 of 1956 patients). Among patients receiving abacavir, 72% were men, 84% were white, and 18% had never received antiretroviral therapy. Screening eliminated immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity reaction (0% in the potential screening group vs. 2.7% in the control group, P<0.001), with a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 47.9%. Hypersensitivity reaction was clinically diagnosed in 93 patients, with a significantly lower incidence in the potential screening group (3.4%) compared with the control group (7.8%) (P < 0.001). HLA-B*5701 testing reduces the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In predominantly white populations, similar to those in this study, 94% of patients do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele and are at low risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Our results show that pharmacogenetic testing can be used to prevent a specific toxic effect of a drug. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00340080.)		HLA-B	Abacavir		1
11888582	The use of abacavir - a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase - is complicated by a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity syndrome in approximately 5% of cases. Genetic factors that influence the immune response to abacavir may confer susceptibility. We aimed to find associations between MHC alleles and abacavir hypersensitivity in HIV-1-infected individuals treated with abacavir. MHC region typing was performed in the first 200 participants in a Western Australian HIV cohort study exposed to abacavir. Significant hypersensitivity to abacavir was identified in 18 cases and was ruled out in 167 individuals exposed to the drug for more than 6 weeks (abacavir tolerant). 15 people had some symptoms but did not meet the criteria for abacavir hypersensitivity. p values ​​were corrected for comparisons between multiple HLA alleles (p(c)) by multiplying the raw p value by the estimated number of HLA alleles present within the locus examined. HLA-B*5701 was present in 14 (78%) of 18 patients with abacavir hypersensitivity, and in four (2%) of 167 abacavir-tolerant patients (OR 117 [95% CI 29-481], p(c (<0.0001), and the combination of HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ3 was found in 13 (72%) of hypersensitive and five (3%) of tolerant patients (73 [20-268], p(c)<0.0001). HLA-B*5701, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3 were combined in 13 (72%) of the hypersensitive patients and none of the tolerant patients (822 [43-15675], p(c)<0.0001) Other MHC markers also present on the ancestral haplotype 57.1 to which the above three markers belong confirmed the presence of the haplotype-specific linkage defect, and mapped potential susceptibility loci to a region bounded by C4A6 and HLA-C within the entire abacavir-exposed group (n=200). Because HLA-B*5701, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3 have a positive predictive value for hypersensitivity of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 97%, genetic susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity is determined by the ancestral haplotype 57.1 in our population, withholding abacavir in... Patients with HLA-B*5701, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3 reduced the prevalence of hypersensitivity from 9% to 2.5% without depriving any patients of inappropriate use of abacavir.		HLA-B	Abacavir		1
11943262	Hypersensitivity to abacavir affects about 4% of patients receiving the drug for treatment of HIV-1 infection. We performed a retrospective case-control study to identify multiple peri-HLA-B markers associated with hypersensitivity reactions. HLA-B57 was present in 39 (46%) of 84 patients versus four (4%) of 113 controls (P < 0 small median point 0001). However, because of the lower numbers of women and other ethnic groups enrolled, these results largely relate to white men. The lower sensitivity of HLA-B57 for predicting abacavir hypersensitivity identified in this study compared to a previous report highlights that the predictive values ​​of markers will vary between populations. Clinical monitoring and management of hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving abacavir should remain unchanged.		HLA-B	Abacavir		1
22722860	Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are highly polymorphic proteins that initiate immunity by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells. HLA polymorphisms predominantly map to the antigen-binding cleft, thus diversifying the repertoire of self- and pathogen-derived peptide antigens selected by different HLA allotypes. An increasing number of immune-based drug reactions, including abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), are associated with specific HLA alleles. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these associations, including AHS, a typical HLA-linked drug reaction that occurs exclusively in individuals with the common histocompatibility allele HLA-B*57:01, and with a relative risk greater than 1,000. (Refs 6, 7). We have shown that unmodified abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B*57:01, lying across the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and into the F pocket, where the carboxy-terminal tryptophan normally stabilizes HLA-B*57:01-binding peptides. . Abacavir binds with remarkable specificity to HLA-B*57:01, altering the conformation and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. In this way, abacavir directs the selection of new endogenous peptides, leading to a marked change in the “immune self.” The peptide-centered “variable self” activates abacavir-specific T cells, leading to polyclonal CD8 T cell activation and systemic reaction manifested as AHS. We also show that carbamazepine, a widely used antiepileptic drug associated with hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*15:02 individuals, binds to this variant, resulting in changes in the repertoire of presented endogenous peptides. Our findings simultaneously highlight the importance of HLA polymorphisms in evolving pharmacogenomics and provide a general mechanism for some of the increasing number of HLA-associated hypersensitivities involving small molecule drugs.

23803709	Progress in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, especially with regard to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, requires regular updating of concepts and management. A European LeukemiaNet expert panel reviewed previous and new studies to update recommendations made in 2009. We recommend imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib as first-line treatment. Response is assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and/or cytogenetics at 3, 6, and 12 months. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels ≥10% at 3 months, <1% at 6 months, and ≥0.1% from 12 months onwards define optimal response, while >10% at 6 months and >1% at 12 months onwards define Failure, and this requires a change in treatment. Likewise, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 3 months and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) from 6 months onward define optimal response, whereas no CyR (Philadelphia chromosome positive [Ph+] > 95%) at 3 months, less PCyR at 6 months, and less than CCyR from 12 months onwards define failure. Between optimum and failure, there is an intermediate warning zone that requires more frequent monitoring. Similar definitions are provided for response to second-line treatment. Specific recommendations are made for patients with advanced stages and tumors, and for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Optimal responders should continue treatment indefinitely, with close monitoring, or may be enrolled in controlled studies to discontinue treatment once a deeper molecular response has been achieved.

19169242	Although the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in embryogenesis is well established, its functions in adult tissue regeneration and maintenance remain unclear, and the relationship of these functions to cancer development has not been determined. Here we show that loss of Smooth (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway, impairs hematopoietic stem cell regeneration and reduces induction of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Loss of Smo depletes CML stem cells—the cells that spread leukemia—while constitutively active Smo increases the number of CML stem cells and accelerates the disease. As a potential mechanism of Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb, which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Hh signaling attenuates not only the proliferation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) driven by wild-type BCR-ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mice and human CML. These data indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and tumorigenic stem cells in the hematopoietic system and raise the possibility that drug resistance and disease recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML can be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.

20385986	There is significant variation in the level of molecular responses achieved with imatinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). These differences could result from variable treatment adherence. Eighty-seven patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase treated with imatinib 400 mg/day for a median of 59.7 months (range, 25–104 months) and who achieved a complete cytogenetic response had adherence monitored over a 3-month period using electronic micromonitoring. device. Adherence was associated with levels of molecular response. Other factors that could influence the outcome were also analysed. The median adherence rate was 98% (range, 24% to 104%). Twenty-three patients (26.4%) had adherence < or = 90%; In 12 of these patients (14%), adherence was <or=80%. There was a strong association between adherence rate (< or = 90% or > 90%) and the 6-year probability of a 3-log reduction (also known as major molecular response [MMR]) in BCR-ABL1 transcripts (28.4%) v 94.5%; P < .001) and also complete molecular response (CMR; 0% v 43.8%; P = .002). Multivariate analysis identified adherence (relative risk [RR], 11.7; P = .001) and expression of human molecular organic cation transporter-1 (RR, 1.79; P = .038) as the only independent predictors of MMR. Adherence was the only independent predictor of CMR. No molecular responses were observed when adherence was < or = 80% ( P < .001). Patients whose imatinib doses were increased had poor adherence (86.4%). In this latter population, adherence was the only independent predictor of inability to achieve MMR (RR, 17.66; P = .006). In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have been treated with imatinib for several years, poor adherence may be the predominant reason for the inability to obtain adequate molecular responses.

28273028	Imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, has improved the prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We performed efficacy and safety analyzes based on more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who were treated with imatinib as first-line therapy. In this open-label, multicenter, cross-over design trial, we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyzes included overall survival, response to treatment, and serious adverse events. The average follow-up was 10.9 years. Given the high crossover rate among patients randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine (65.6%) and the short duration of treatment before crossover in these patients (median, 0.8 years), the present analyzes focused on patients who received repeat therapy. They were randomly assigned to receive imatinib. Among patients in the imatinib group, the estimated overall survival rate at 10 years was 83.3%. Nearly half of the patients (48.3%) randomly assigned to imatinib completed study treatment with imatinib, and 82.8% had a complete cytogenetic response. The serious adverse events that researchers considered to be related to imatinib were uncommon and occurred most often during the first year of treatment. Approximately 11 years of follow-up showed that the effectiveness of imatinib was maintained over time and that long-term administration of imatinib was not associated with unacceptable cumulative or late toxic effects.

11248153	The HER2 gene, which encodes the growth factor receptor HER2, is amplified, and HER2 is overexpressed in 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers, increasing tumor aggressiveness. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) treatment with anthracyclines were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in 36 women), cyclophosphamide alone (138 women) or trastuzumab (143 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracyclines were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher objective response rate (50% vs. 32%, P<0.001), and a longer response rate (50% vs. 32%; P <0.001). Duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), lower death rate at 1 year (22% vs. 33%; P=0.008), and longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months); P = 0.01), a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most significant adverse event was New York Heart Association grade 3 or 4 cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab. 8% of the group were given anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide alone; 13% of the group were given paclitaxel and trastuzumab. 1% of the group was given paclitaxel alone. Although cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.		HER2	Trastuzumab		1
20728210	Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), has been studied in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. ToGA (trastuzumab for gastric cancer) was an international, open-label, phase III, randomized controlled trial conducted at 122 centers in 24 countries. Patients with gastroesophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma were eligible for inclusion if their tumors showed increased expression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by in situ hybridization. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin, fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles, or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by randomization stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, site of primary cancer, and measurability of disease, which was implemented using a central interactive voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomized patients who received the study drug at least once. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n = 298; chemotherapy alone, n = 296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n = 294; n = 290). Median follow-up was 18.6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60). 0.91; p=0.0046). The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] versus chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] versus 134 [46%]), and Neutrophils (157). [53%] versus 165 [57%]). Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs. 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs. 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy may be considered a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

16236738	We present the pooled results of two trials that compared adjuvant chemotherapy with or without concurrent trastuzumab in women with surgically removed HER2-positive breast cancer. The National Adjuvant Surgical Breast and Bowel Project B-31 trial compared doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel every 3 weeks (Group 1) with the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab starting at the first dose of paclitaxel (Group 2). The North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831 compared three regimens: doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel (Group A), the same regimen followed by 52 weeks of trastuzumab after paclitaxel (Group B), and the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab initiated. In combination with paclitaxel (Group C). The studies were modified to include a combined analysis comparing groups 1 and A (control group) with groups 2 and C (trastuzumab group). Group B was excluded because trastuzumab was not administered concomitantly with paclitaxel. By 15 March 2005, 394 cases (recurrence, second primary cancer, or death before recurrence) had been reported, leading to the first scheduled interim analysis. Of these, 133 were in the trastuzumab group and 261 were in the control group (hazard ratio 0.48; P<0.0001). This result exceeded the limits of early stopping. The absolute difference in disease-free survival between the trastuzumab group and the control group was 12 percent after three years. Treatment with trastuzumab was associated with a 33% reduction in the risk of death (P=0.015). The three-year cumulative incidence of grade 3 or 4 congestive heart failure or death from cardiac causes in the trastuzumab group was 4.1 percent in trial B-31 and 2.9 percent in trial N9831. Trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improves outcomes among women with surgically resected HER2-positive breast cancer.

16236737	Trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, has clinical activity in advanced breast cancer that overexpresses HER2. We investigated its efficacy and safety after resection of early-stage breast cancer and completion of chemotherapy. This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared one or two years of trastuzumab given every three weeks with observational patients with HER2-positive, node-negative, or node-positive breast cancer who completed regional brachytherapy and at least four cycles of neoadjuvant or node-specific adjuvant. Adjuvant chemotherapy. Data were available for 1,694 women randomly assigned to 2 years of trastuzumab, 1,694 women assigned to 1 year of trastuzumab, and 1,693 women assigned to observation. We report here the results of only 1-year trastuzumab treatment or observation. In the first planned interim analysis (median follow-up of 1 year), 347 events (breast cancer recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, second non-breast malignancy, or death) were observed: 127 events in the trastuzumab group and 220 events in Note. group. The unadjusted hazard ratio of an event in the trastuzumab group, compared with the control group, was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.67; P < 0.0001 by log-rank test, crossing interim limits of analysis), representing the absolute benefit in terms of survival. Disease-free life for two years increased by 8.4 percentage points. Overall survival in the two groups was not significantly different (29 deaths with trastuzumab versus 37 with observation). Severe cardiotoxicity developed in 0.5 percent of women treated with trastuzumab. One year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves disease-free survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer.

19217204	The clinical success of selective kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and erlotinib, as therapeutic agents for many human cancers has generated significant interest in the further development and clinical testing of these inhibitors for a wide range of malignancies. While much of this effort has focused on tyrosine kinase receptors, including EGFR, HER2, PDGF receptor, c-KIT, and MET, serine/threonine kinase inhibitors are also beginning to emerge within discovery pipelines. Among these kinases, RAF and MEK kinases have received significant attention, largely due to their relatively high frequency of activating RAS mutations (about 20% of all human cancers), an upstream activator of the well-established RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade as well as mutations. Recurrent activation of BRAF kinase (about 7% of all human cancers). Here, we summarize the current state of development of kinase inhibitors directed at this signaling pathway, a few of which have already shown favorable toxicological profiles as well as promising activity in early-phase clinical studies.

18288997	Targeted therapies via compounds that inhibit a specific target molecule represent a new perspective in cancer treatment. In contrast to conventional chemotherapy, which acts on all dividing cells, leading to toxic effects and damage to normal tissues, targeted drugs allow to hit, in a more specific way, subsets of cells directly involved in tumor development. Molecules that control cell proliferation and death, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for growth factors, are among the best targets for this type of therapeutic approach. Two classes of compounds targeting RTKs are currently used in clinical practice: monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The era of targeted therapy began with the approval of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against HER2, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and imatinib, a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-Abl, in chronic myeloid leukemia. Despite initial enthusiasm for the effectiveness of these treatments, clinicians soon had to face the problem of relapse, as cancer patients almost always developed drug resistance, often due to activation of alternative RTKs pathways. From this perspective, the rationale for targeting drugs is undergoing a radical transformation. In the past, the main effort was aimed at developing highly specific inhibitors that act on individual RTKs. Now, there is general agreement that molecules that simultaneously interfere with multiple RTKs may be more effective than single targeted agents. With the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of Sorafenib and Sunitinib—which target VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT-3, and c-Kit—a different scenario has emerged, as a new generation of anticancer drugs has emerged, capable of inhibiting more than one pathway. , will likely play a major role.

24789362	The evolving field of personalized medicine plays an increasingly important role in cancer prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Its importance in clinical management is demonstrated by the recent introduction into routine clinical practice of various individualized and molecularly targeted therapies with increased efficacy and/or reduced toxicity. Identifying cancer predisposition genes, such as the BRCA genes in breast cancer, allows screening programs to identify patients who are “at risk” for cancer and helps them make decisions about individual risk modification behaviors. Personalized medicine is also playing an increasingly important role in cancer treatment. It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of different common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast and KRAS-positive colorectal cancer. cancer; Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and non-small cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. The effectiveness of different targeted therapies in such differentiated tumors suggests that we are entering an era in which treatment decisions are based on the tumor's molecular abnormality profile or “signature,” rather than the tumor tissue type or anatomical site of origin, improving patient prognosis and quality. from life. This mini-review focuses on the role of personalized medicine in cancer prevention and treatment as well as its future direction in oncology.		HER2	Imatinib		0
15193255	The strong clinical activity of imatinib and trastuzumab for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and breast cancer has demonstrated that blocking pathogenic tyrosine kinases can alter the natural history of human tumors. On the other hand, EGF receptor inhibitors showed generally modest activity. The inconsistency in the development of these agents means that both molecular target dependence and patient selection are essential for a successful outcome of this procedure. We will compare lessons learned from the development of Abl, c-Kit, HER2/neu (erbB2), and EGFR inhibitors, highlight successes and limitations in this area, and suggest new approaches for clinical development of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

11385576	Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two main types of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, are multifactorial conditions of unknown cause. The Crohn's disease susceptibility locus has been mapped to chromosome 16. Here we used a positional cloning strategy, based on linkage analysis followed by linkage disequilibrium mapping, to identify three independent associations with Crohn's disease: a frameshift variant and two missense variants for Crohn's disease. NOD2, which encodes a member of the Apaf-1/Ced-4 superfamily of apoptosis regulators that is expressed in monocytes. These NOD2 variants alter the structure of the protein's leucine-rich repeat domain or flanking region. NOD2 activates nuclear factor NF-kB; This activation function is regulated by the carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain, which has an inhibitory role and also serves as an intracellular receptor for components of microbial pathogens. These observations suggest that the NOD2 gene product confers susceptibility to Crohn's disease by altering the recognition of these components and/or by overactivating NF-kB in monocytes, thus documenting a molecular model of the pathogenic mechanism of Crohn's disease that can now be further developed. Investigation.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
11385577	Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, which is thought to result from the influence of environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. A gene located in the region surrounding the centromere of chromosome 16, IBD1, that contributes to susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been identified by multiple association studies, but the specific gene(s) have not been identified. NOD2, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to disease resistance gene products, is located in the linkage peak region on chromosome 16 (ref. 7). Here we show, using transmission disequilibrium testing and case-control analysis, that a frameshift mutation resulting from a cytosine insertion, 3020insC, which is predicted to encode a truncated NOD2 protein, is associated with Crohn's disease. Wild-type NOD2 activates the nuclear factor NF-kappaB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides; However, this induction was deficient in mutant NOD2. These results implicate NOD2 in Crohn's disease susceptibility and suggest a link between the innate immune response to bacterial components and disease progression.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
12527755	Nod2 activates the NF-kappaB pathway after intracellular stimulation by bacterial products. Recently, mutations in Nod2 have been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease, suggesting a role for bacteria-host interactions in the etiology of this disorder. Here we show that Nod2 is a general peptidoglycan sensor by recognizing muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria. Furthermore, the frameshift mutation 3020insC, the most common Nod2 variant associated with Crohn's patients, completely abrogates Nod2-dependent detection of peptidoglycan and MDP. Together, these findings impact the understanding of the progression of Crohn's disease. In addition, the characterization of Nod2 as the first pathogen-recognizing molecule that detects MDP will help unravel the known biological activities of this immunomodulatory compound.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
12876555	Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. Tremendous progress has recently been made in understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases. By studying patients and mouse models, Crohn's disease has been shown to be driven by the production of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), while ulcerative colitis is probably driven by the production of IL-13. A second area of ​​progress is identifying the specific genetic abnormalities responsible for the disease. The most important finding is the identification of mutations in the gene encoding the NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2) protein in a subset of patients with Crohn's disease. Here, we discuss these recent findings and implications for treatment.	Crohn's Disease	NOD2			1
17565376	CARD15/NOD2 mutations are associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CD and GVHD are suspected to be associated with dysfunction of Peyer's patches (PP) and isolated lymphoid follicles (LFs). Using a novel Card15/Nod2 knockout (KO) mouse model, we analyzed the effect of the gene on these lymphoid formations along with the development of experimental colitis. At weeks 4, 12, and 52, the numbers of PPs and LFs were higher in KO mice while no difference was observed at birth. At weeks 4 and 12, the size and cellular composition of PPs were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. PPs from KO mice were larger with an increased proportion of M cells and CD4(+) T cells. KO mice were also characterized by higher concentrations of TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12 and IL4 measured by ELISA. In contrast, few differences were found in PP-null ileum and spleen of KO mice. Using chamber experiments, we found that this PP phenotype is associated with increased both cell permeability and yeast/bacterial translocation. Finally, KO mice were more susceptible to TNBS-induced colitis. Card15/Nod2 deficiency leads to abnormal development and function of PPs characterized by an exaggerated immune response and increased permeability. These observations provide a comprehensive link between the molecular defect and human CARD15/NOD2-associated disorders: CD and GVHD.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
27639807	GATA3 is a transcription factor that regulates T cell production of cytokines. We studied the role of GATA3 in the development of colitis in mice. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analyzes of colon tissue from patients with Crohn's disease (n = 61) or ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 74) or from patients without IBD (n = 22), to measure GATA3 levels. Colitis was induced by administration of oxazolone or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to control mice, mice with T-cell-specific deletion of GATA3, and mice with deletion of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 (TNFR double knockout). ); Some mice were given a GATA3-specific DNAzyme (hgd40) or control DNAzyme by intrarectal administration, or systemic injection of an anti-TNF antibody before or during the sensitization and challenge phase of colitis induction. Colon tissues were collected and immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Lamina propria mononuclear cells and T cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry or cytokine assays. Colonic distribution of the DNA-labeled enzyme and inflammation were monitored by in vivo imaging (endoscopy) of mice. GATA3 messenger RNA levels were higher in colon tissue from patients with ulcerative colitis, but not ileal Crohn's disease, compared with control tissue; GATA3 levels correlated with levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL] 9, IL17A, IL6, IL5, IL4, IL13, and TNF). We observed increased expression of GATA3 by lamina propria T cells from mice with colitis compared with controls. Mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of GATA3 did not develop colitis and their colon tissue did not produce inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL9, or IL13). DNAzyme hgd40 inhibits the expression of GATA3 messenger RNA by unstimulated and stimulated T cells, and it is distributed throughout the inflamed colon of mice with colitis. Colon tissue from mice given hgd40 had reduced expression of GATA3 messenger RNA, compared with mice given the control DNA enzyme. Mice given hgd40 did not develop colitis after administration of oxazolone or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; Lamina propria cells from these mice showed lower levels of IL6, IL9, and IL13 than cells from mice given the control DNA enzyme. Microscopic images revealed that hgd40 and anti-TNF reduced colitis over 3 days. hgd40 reduces colitis in TNFR double knockout mice. GATA3 levels are increased in patients with UC and are associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines in mice and humans. A DNA enzyme that blocks expression of GATA3 reduces colitis in mice, independent of TNF, and reduces cytokine levels in the colon. This DNA enzyme may be developed to treat patients with ulcerative colitis.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
17057216	Geographic and ethnic differences in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease recurrence suggest that environmental factors influence the risk of developing the disease. Prevention of helminths (parasitic worms) through improved hygiene may be one factor leading to increased spread of the disease. Parasitic worms alter the body's mucosal and systemic immunity. Animals exposed to helminths are protected from experimental colitis and other immune diseases, and helminth colonization can be used to treat persistent murine and human diseases. Helminths stimulate mucosal T cells to produce Th2 and regulatory cytokines. IL4, TGFbeta, and IL10 in helminth-induced mucosa are likely part of the protective process. Helminths affect innate immune pathways such as TLR4 expression and function. Helminths also induce various subsets of regulatory-type T cells in the gut that limit the growth and function of effector T cells. These effects of always-present helminths may have protected people from immune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
22573572	About 70 loci are associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD), particularly in innate immunity, autophagy, and pathogen recognition pathways. Phenotype and genotype associations are inconsistent. CD susceptibility polymorphisms ATG16L1 rs2241880, ICAM1 rs5498, IL4 rs2070874, IL17F rs763780, IRGM rs13361189, ITLN1 rs2274910, LRRK2 rs11175593, and TLR4 rs4986790 were reported in a Portuguese population (511 patients). with CD, and 626 controls) and were evaluated for their association with clinical characteristics of CD . There is a significant association between CD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG16L1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.36 [1.15-1.60], P = 2.7 × 10(-6) for the G allele), IRGM (OR 1.56 [1.21]-1.93), P = 3.9 × 10(-4) for the C allele), and ITLN1 (or 1.55 [1.28-1.88], P = 4.9 × 10(-4) for the C allele). These SNPs are associated with ileocolic site (OR, respectively, 1.49, 1.52, and 1.70), ileocolic site (OR, respectively, 1.31, 1.57, and 1.68), and upper gastrointestinal tract involvement (OR, respectively, 1.31, 1.57, and 1.68). respectively for ATG16L1 and IRGM). , 1.96 and 1.95). The GG risk genotype in ATG16L1 is associated with patients responding to steroids (OR 1.89), responding to immunosuppressants (OR 1.77), and biologic therapy (OR 1.89). Both SNPs in ITLN1 and IRGM are associated with a positive response to biologic therapy. The risk of developing ileal, ileal, and upper gastrointestinal sites increased with the number of risk alleles (OR for three alleles, respectively, 7.10, 3.54, and 12.07); The odds ratio for a positive response to biological therapy is 3.66. A multilocus approach using autophagy-related genes provides insight into CD genotype-phenotype associations and genetic markers to predict therapeutic responses.	Crohn's Disease	IL4			0
25056061	Schizophrenia is a highly genetic disorder. Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that can be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage, genome-wide study of the schizophrenia genome across 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identified 128 independent associations covering 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide importance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Correlations between genes expressed in the brain were enriched, providing biological plausibility to the results. Many of the findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but the associations in DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance for schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in the brain, associations were enriched between genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the predicted relationship between the immune system and schizophrenia.

18583979	In an effort to identify potential genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, research groups around the world have published more than 1,000 genetic association studies with largely inconsistent results. To facilitate interpretation of these results, we have created a regularly updated online database of all published genetic association studies of schizophrenia (“SzGene”). For all polymorphisms with genotype data available in at least four independent case-control samples, we systematically performed random-effects meta-analyses using allelic contrasts. From 118 meta-analyses, a total of 24 genetic variants in 16 different genes (APOE, COMT, DAO, DRD1, DRD2, DRD4, DTNBP1, GABRB2, GRIN2B, HP, IL1B, MTHFR, PLXNA2, SLC6A4, TP53, and TPH1) showed significant effects. Nominal significance with average summary odds ratios of about 1.23. Seven of these variables have not been analyzed previously. According to recently proposed criteria for evaluating cumulative evidence in genetic association studies, four of the important findings can be described as showing “strong” epidemiological validity. Our project represents the first comprehensive online resource of systematically synthesized and collated evidence for genetic association studies in schizophrenia. As such, it can serve as a model for field summaries of genetic associations in common and genetically complex disorders.	Schizophrenia	DRD2			1
12554675	Although changes in nucleotide sequences that affect the conformation and structure of proteins are well known, functional changes resulting from nucleotide substitutions cannot always be inferred from simple analysis of DNA sequences. Because a strong bias for synonymous codon usage has been detected in the human DRD2 gene, suggesting selection at synonymous positions, through the relative independence of the G+C content of third codon positions from equal G+C frequencies, we chose to study the functional effects of the six synonymous changes. Known naturally occurring genes (C132T, G423A, T765C, C939T, C957T, and G1101A) in human DRD2. We report here that some synonymous mutations in human DRD2 have functional effects and suggest a novel genetic mechanism. 957T, rather than being “silent,” altered the expected mRNA folding, led to a decrease in mRNA stability and translation, and significantly altered dopamine-induced regulation of DRD2 expression. 1101A did not show an effect per se but abolished the above-mentioned effects of 957T in the 957T/1101A compound clone, demonstrating that combinations of synonymous mutations can have functional consequences radically different from those of each isolated mutation. C957T was found in linkage disequilibrium in European-American populations with -141C Ins/Del and TaqI 'A' variants, which have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and alcoholism, respectively. These findings question some of the assumptions made about synonymous variation in molecular population genetics and genetic mapping studies of diseases with complex inheritance, and suggest that synonymous variation can have effects of potential pathophysiological and pharmacological importance.

1832466	- The A1 allele of the Taq I polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene was previously reported to be present in 69% of alcoholics, compared to 20% of controls. Other research has reported no significant difference in the prevalence of the A1 allele in alcoholics compared to controls and no evidence that the DRD2 gene is associated with alcoholism. We hypothesized that these apparently conflicting results may be because increases in the prevalence of the A1 allele may not be specific to alcoholism. Thus, we examined other disorders frequently associated with alcoholism or those thought to involve defects in dopaminergic neurotransmission. -Comparative case study. To minimize the effect of racial differences in gene frequencies, the study was limited to non-Hispanic whites. - Ambulatory patients and hospital patients. -Among all known controls (n = 314), 77 (24.5%) carried the A1 allele. Of the 69 controls known to be nonalcoholic, 10 (14.5%) carried the A1 allele. The prevalence of the A1 allele was significantly increased in patients with Tourette syndrome (44.9%, n = 147), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (46.2%, n = 104), autism (54.5%, n = 33), and alcoholism ( 42.3%), n = 104), and PTSD (45.7%, n = 35). After correcting for multiple comparisons (requiring P less than 0.0009 for significance), all remained significant except for PTSD. The prevalence of the A1 allele was not significantly increased in patients with depression, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, or obesity. The prevalence of the A1 allele in drug addiction and schizophrenia was only significant when compared with the nonalcoholic control group, and no correction for multiple comparisons was performed. These results indicate that the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with a number of behavioral disorders in which it may act as a modifier rather than as an underlying causative factor.

10530637	Cardiofacial Velo syndrome (VCFS), a syndrome characterized by an increased frequency of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is associated with a small interstitial deletion of chromosome 22q11. We evaluated 50 adults with VCFS using a structured clinical interview (Clinical Evaluation Schedules in Neuropsychiatry or Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule for Adults with Developmental Disabilities if IQ <50) to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis. The schizophrenia phenotype of individuals with VCFS and schizophrenia was compared with a matched series of individuals with schizophrenia and without VCFS (n = 12). The King's Schizotypy Questionnaire was administered to individuals with VCFS (n = 41), their first-degree relatives (n = 68), and a series of unrelated normal controls (n = 316). All individuals with a VCFS deletion for the N25 probe (n = 48) were genotyped for a genetic polymorphism in the COMT gene that results in differences in enzymatic activity. Fifteen subjects with VCFS (30%) had a psychotic disorder, with 24% (n = 12) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. In addition, 6 (12%) had major depression without psychotic features. Individuals with schizophrenia had fewer negative symptoms and had a relatively later age of onset compared with those with schizophrenia and without VCFS. We found no evidence that possession of the low-activity COMT allele was associated with schizophrenia in our sample of individuals with VCFS. The high prevalence of schizophrenia in this group suggests that chromosome 22q11 may contain a gene or genes relevant to the etiology of schizophrenia in the general population.

16319375	It has been common for psychiatric research, including the search for predisposing genes, to proceed on the assumption that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two separate disease entities with different underlying etiologies. These represent Emil Kraepelin's traditional binary classifications of so-called “functional” psychosis and form the basis of modern diagnostic practice. However, emerging findings from many areas of psychiatric research do not fit well into this model. In particular, the pattern of findings emerging from genetic studies shows increasing evidence of overlap in genetic susceptibility across traditional classification categories – including association findings in DAOA(G72), DTNBP1 (dysbindin), COMT, BDNF, DISC1, and NRG1. Emerging evidence suggests that there may be relatively specific relationships between genotype and psychopathology. For example, DISC1 and NRG1 may confer susceptibility to a form of the disease with mixed features of schizophrenia and mania. Elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships is still at an early stage, but the current findings highlight the need to consider alternative approaches to classification and conceptualization for psychiatric research rather than continuing to rely heavily on the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy. As psychosis susceptibility genes are identified and characterized over the next few years, this will have a major impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and lead to changes in the classification and clinical practice of psychiatry.

16984965	Heterogeneity in phenotypic manifestations and inconsistent genetic associations in mental illness remains a major challenge in molecular psychiatry. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that altered promoter DNA methylation can play a critical role in mediating differential regulation of genes and in facilitating short-term adaptation in response to the environment. Here, we report the investigation of the differential activity of membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT) due to variable promoter methylation and the nature of the contribution of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism as risk factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder through an analysis of 115 cases. Postmortem brain samples from the frontal lobes. These studies are the first to reveal that MB-COMT promoter DNA is often hypomethylated in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, compared with controls (methylation rate: 26 and 29 vs. 60%; P = 0.004 and 0.008, respectively), Especially in the left frontal lobe (methylation rate: 29 and 30 vs. 81%; P = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). Quantitative gene expression analyzes showed a corresponding increase in transcript levels of MB-COMT in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients compared with controls ( P = 0.02) with an accompanying inverse relationship between MB-COMT and DRD1 expression. Furthermore, there was a tendency for the Val allele to be enriched for the COMT Val158Met polymorphism with MB-COMT hypomethylation in patients. These results suggest that overexpression of MB-COMT due to promoter hypomethylation and/or a hyperactive allele of COMT may increase prefrontal dopamine degradation providing a molecular basis for the shared symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

22584867	We used a translational convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach to identify and prioritize genes involved in schizophrenia, through gene-level integration of genome-wide association study data with other gene and epigenetic expression studies in humans and animal models. Using multiple evidence scoring and pathway analyses, we identify the top genes (DISC1, TCF4, MBP, MOBP, NCAM1, NRCAM, NDUFV2, RAB18, as well as ADCYAP1, BDNF, CNR1, COMT, DRD2, DTNBP1, GAD1, GRIA1, GRIN2B, HTR2A, NRG1, RELN, SNAP-25, TNIK), brain development, myelination, cell adhesion, glutamate receptor signaling, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and cAMP-mediated signaling as key to pathophysiology and as targets for therapeutic intervention. Overall, the data are consistent with a model of dysfunctional connectivity in schizophrenia, resulting from the effects of neurodevelopmental environmental stress on a background of genetic vulnerability. In addition, we show how top candidate genes identified by CFG can be used to generate a genetic risk prediction score (GRPS) to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, with predictive power in independent populations. The GRPS also distinguishes between the classic age of onset of schizophrenia, early illness, and late illness. We also show, in three independent cohorts, two European Americans and one African American, increased overlap, reproducibility, and consistency in findings from single nucleotide polymorphisms to genes, then genes prioritized by the CFG, and ultimately at the level of biological pathways and mechanisms. Finally, we compared the top candidate genes for schizophrenia from this analysis with the top candidate genes for bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders from our previous CFG analyses, as well as results from the autism and Alzheimer's domains. Overall, our work maps the genomic and biological landscape of schizophrenia, providing leads toward better understanding of the disease, diagnosis, and treatment. It also reveals significant genetic overlap with other major psychiatric disorder domains, suggesting a need for improved nosology.	Bipolar Disorder	COMT			0
15108180	The fine-tuning of neural connections during development is regulated by environmental interactions. Some fine-tuning occurs through changes in gene expression and/or DNA methylation states of epigenetic genes. DNA methylation occurs by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to a cytosine residue in the CpG dinucleotide sequence. Although CpG sequences scattered throughout the genome are usually highly methylated, those occurring in CpG islands in the promoter regions of genes are less methylated. In most cases, the extent of DNA methylation correlates with the extent of gene inactivation. Other known epigenetic mechanisms include histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling, RNA inactivation, RNA modification, and DNA rearrangements. Exposure memory expressed as epigenetic DNA modifications allows genetic plasticity and short-term adaptation of each generation to its environment. Environmental factors that affect DNA methylation include diet, proteins, medications, and hormones. The induced methylation changes may lead to an altered epigenetic response upon subsequent hormonal stimulation. The DNA methylation status of genes may be maintained as they transition through mitosis and meiosis. An increasing amount of data suggests a role for DNA methylation in multifactorial psychiatric disorders. For example, treatment with methionine can exacerbate psychosis; While valproate, a drug that produces hypomethylated DNA, reduces these symptoms. Hypermethylation in the promoter region of the RELN gene is associated with decreased gene expression. The protein of this gene reelin, which is essential for neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, is reduced in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting hypermethylation of the promoter region in these disorders. Some evidence suggests methylation of the promoter regions of the DRD2 and HTR2A genes in schizophrenia and mood disorders as well. DNA methylation typically increases with age, although hypomethylation in the promoter region of the A4 amyloid precursor gene during aging may play a role in Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are needed to determine the role of methylomes and other epigenetic phenomena in the nervous system.	Bipolar Disorder	DRD2			0
15952869	No specific gene has been identified for any major psychiatric disorder, including schizophrenia, although there is strong evidence supporting the genetic basis of these complex and devastating disorders. There are several possible reasons for this failure, ranging from poor study design with low statistical power to genetic mechanisms such as polygenic inheritance, epigenetic interactions, and pleiotropy. Most currently used study designs are inadequate to uncover these mechanisms. However, to date, genetic studies have provided some valuable insights into the causes and potential treatments for psychiatric disorders. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that understanding the genetic etiology of psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, will be most successful with integrative approaches that take genetic and epigenetic factors into account. For example, several genes including those encoding dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) have been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia and related disorders through... Meta-analyses and meta-analyses. Large, multicenter studies. There is also increasing evidence for the role of DRD1, NMDA (GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) receptor genes in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent studies have indicated that epigenetic modification of the reelin (RELN), BDNF, and DRD2 promoters confers susceptibility to clinical psychiatric conditions. Pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders is likely to be more effective once the molecular pathogenesis is known. For example, hypoactive alleles of DRD2 and hyperactive alleles of COMT, which degrades dopamine in the synaptic cleft, are associated with schizophrenia. It is likely that insufficient dopamine transmission in the frontal lobe plays a role in the development of the negative symptoms associated with this disorder. Antipsychotic treatments with partial action on dopamine D2 receptors may be a reasonable alternative to current treatments and will be effective in reducing symptoms in individuals with psychosis. Treatments using dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonists or COMT inhibitors may also be beneficial for patients with negative symptoms in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The complex etiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders calls for consideration of both genetic and epigenetic systems and careful design of experiments to illuminate the genetic mechanisms that confer responsibility for these disorders and to inform current and new treatments.

22384243	ZNF804a was identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs1344706) in ZNF804a reached genome-wide statistical significance for association with a combined diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder. Although the molecular function of ZNF804a is unknown, its amino acid sequence is predicted to contain a C2H2-type zinc finger domain and suggests that ZNF804a plays a role in DNA binding and transcription. Here, we confirm that ZNF804a directly contributes to transcriptional control by regulating the expression of several SZ-associated genes and directly interacts with chromatin proximal to the promoter regions of PRSS16 and COMT, the two genes that we find regulated by ZNF804a. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that ZNF804a localized to the nuclei of rat neural progenitor cells in culture and in vivo. We demonstrated that expression of ZNF804a results in a significant increase in transcript levels of PRSS16 and COMT, compared to GFP-transfected controls, and a statistically significant decrease in the transcript levels of PDE4B and DRD2. Furthermore, we show using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that both epitope-tagged and endogenous ZNF804a directly interact with the promoter regions of PRSS16 and COMT, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation by ZNF804a on the expression of these genes. These results are the first to confirm that ZNF804a regulates the transcription levels of four SZ-associated genes, and binds to the proximal chromatin of the promoters of two SZ genes. These results suggest a model where ZNF804a can modulate a transcriptional network of SZ-associated genes.	Bipolar Disorder	DRD2			0
2010058	More than 70 mutations in the two structural genes for procollagen type I (COL1A1 and COL1A2) have been found in bands affected with osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disease in children characterized by fragility of bone and other tissues rich in type I collagen. Mutations include deletions, insertions, RNA splicing mutations, and single-base substitutions that convert a glycine codon to an amino acid codon with a larger side chain. With some exceptions, the most severe disease phenotypes are largely explained by the synthesis of structurally defective proα chains of type I procollagen that either interfere with triple helix folding or with self-assembly of collagen into fibrils. The results underscore how the zipper-like folding of the collagenous triple helix and the self-assembly of collagen fibrils depend on the principle of nuclear growth where a few subunits form a core and then the core is propagated to generate a large structure with a well-defined structure. The principle of nucleated growth is a highly efficient mechanism for the assembly of large structures, but biological systems that rely heavily on nucleated growth are highly vulnerable to mutations that cause the synthesis of structurally abnormal but partially functional subunits. Recently, several mutations in three other collagen genes (COL2A1, COL3A1, and COL4A5) have been found in probands with genetic diseases involving tissues rich in these collagens. Most test for rare genetic diseases but a few appear to have phenotypes that are difficult to distinguish from more common disorders such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, and aortic aneurysm. Therefore, the results suggest that mutations in procollagen genes may cause a wide range of rare and common human diseases.	Osteoporosis	COL1A1			1
16041384	Immunosuppressants are critical in preventing adverse immune reactions associated with allogeneic organ transplantation, but they often cause adverse effects in a number of biological systems, including the skeletal system. The calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and induce potent immunosuppression. Among the NFAT proteins, NFATc1 is essential for the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoblasts. Here we show that FK506 administration results in reduced bone mass despite blockade of osteogenic differentiation. This reduction is caused by a severe impairment of bone formation, suggesting that NFAT transcription factors also have an important role in the transcriptional program of bone cells. Indeed, bone formation is inhibited in Nfatc1- and Nfatc2-deficient cells as well as in osteoblasts treated with FK506. Overexpression of NFATc1 induces Osterix-dependent activation of the Col1a1 promoter (encoding type I collagen), but not Runx2-dependent activation of the Bglap1 promoter (encoding osteocalcin). NFAT and Osterix form a complex that binds to DNA, and this interaction is important for the transcriptional activity of Osterix. Thus, NFAT and Osterix cooperatively control osteoclast bone formation. These findings may provide important insight into the management of post-transplant osteoporosis as well as a new strategy to promote bone regeneration in osteoporosis.	Osteoporosis	COL1A1			0
11285309	Osteoporosis is a common disease with a strong genetic component. We previously described a polymorphic Sp1 binding site in the COL1A1 gene that has been associated with osteoporosis in several populations. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. A meta-analysis showed significant associations between COL1A1 “s” alleles and bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index (BMI), and osteoporotic fractures. The association with fracture was stronger than expected based on observed differences in bone mineral density (BMD) and body mass index (BMI), suggesting an additive effect on bone strength. Gel shift assays showed increased binding affinity of the “s” allele for the Sp1 protein, and primary RNA transcripts derived from the “s” allele were approximately three times more abundant than transcripts derived from the “S” allele in “Ss” heterozygotes. Collagen produced from cultured bone cells from Ss heterozygotes had an increased proportion of alpha1(I) protein compared to alpha2(I) protein, and this was accompanied by an increased proportion of COL1A1 mRNA relative to COL1A2. Finally, the yield strength of bone derived from “Ss” individuals was reduced when compared to bone derived from “SS” individuals. We conclude that the COL1A1 Sp1 polymorphism is a functional genetic variant that leads to osteoporosis through complex mechanisms involving alterations in bone mass and bone quality.

Mutations at these sites primarily lead to connective tissue disorders, osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome types VIIA and VIIB. Two cases of osteoporosis and one case of Marfan syndrome are also the result of mutations at these sites.

12907013	Celiac disease is a genetically determined chronic inflammatory disease caused by an environmental precipitant, gluten. Patients with this disease may mainly suffer from non-gastrointestinal symptoms, as a result of which patients turn to various medical practitioners. Epidemiological studies have shown that celiac disease is very common and affects about 1 in 250 people. This disease is associated with an increased incidence of osteoporosis, infertility, autoimmune diseases, and malignant diseases, especially lymphomas. The mechanism of the intestinal immune response is not entirely clear, but involves a restricted immune reaction to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 T cells in the lamina propria as well as an immune reaction in the intestinal epithelium. An important component of the disease is intraepithelial lymphocytes that may expand clonally in resistant flies and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Studying the mechanism of the immune response in celiac disease can provide insight into the mechanism of inflammatory and autoimmune responses and lead to innovations in treatment.

21278763	Until a few years ago, celiac disease (CD) was thought to be a rare food intolerance limited to childhood and characterized by severe malabsorption and flattened intestinal mucosa. Currently, CD is a common autoimmune disorder in the general population (affecting 1 in 100 individuals), with onset at any age and with a variety of possible presentations. Identifying CD is difficult because it can begin not only with diarrhea and weight loss but also with atypical gastrointestinal (constipation, recurrent abdominal pain) and extraintestinal symptoms (anaemia, elevated transaminases, osteoporosis, recurrent miscarriage, aphthous stomatitis and associated of autoimmune diseases). disorders), or it can be completely asymptomatic. Over the past 20 years, the diagnostic accuracy of CD serology has gradually increased with the development of highly reliable tests, such as detection of tissue transglutaminase IgA, antibodies to the antioxidant gliadin peptide, and IgG. The routine use of antibody markers has allowed researchers to detect a very large number of “borderline” cases, characterized by positive serological results and mild intestinal lesions or normal small intestine architecture, which can be classified as possible CD. Therefore, it is clear that “old celiac disease” with flat mucosa is only part of the CD spectrum. It is possible that serums could identify CD in its early stages, before severe intestinal damage develops. In cases where serological tests are positive but with mild or absent intestinal lesions, detection of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 can help reinforce or rule out the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.

16313685	Celiac disease is a lifelong intolerance to gluten found in wheat, barley and rye, and some patients are allergic to oats as well. The disease is genetically determined, with 10% of first-degree relatives affected and 75% of monozygotic twins concordant. Among patients with celiac disease, 95% are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive. Characteristically, the jejunal mucosa is damaged by a T-cell-mediated autoimmune response that is thought to be initiated by a 33-mer peptide fragment in A2 gliadin, and patients with this disorder have elevated levels of anti-endomycin antibodies and anti-transglutaminase antibodies in the tissues. Their blood. Celiac disease is one of the most important food intolerances that can be diagnosed, and with the advent of a simple blood test to detect cases, prevalence rates are thought to be around 1:100.

Impact of bone fractures. Small bowel biopsy is essential for diagnosis and shows a characteristic flat appearance with crypt hypoplasia and epithelial infiltration with lymphocytes. Diet is key to management and a gluten-free diet effectively treats the condition. However, this commitment is lifelong and many supermarket aisles are effectively closed to individuals with celiac disease. Adherence can be monitored by measuring antibodies in the blood, which return to a negative state after 6-9 months. Patients with mild symptoms who are accidentally discovered to have celiac disease often ask whether it is necessary to adhere to the diet. Current advice is that adherence to the diet is essential to avoid long-term complications, which are mainly osteoporosis and small bowel lymphoma. However, the risk of these complications is greatly reduced in patients who follow a gluten-free diet.	Osteoporosis	HLA-DQ2			0
19143879	Public concern about gluten has led to widespread demand for gluten-free foods, yet celiac disease remains largely underdiagnosed, and some confusion remains regarding optimal diagnostic practices. Small intestine histology is the gold standard for diagnosis. High-quality commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for transglutaminase A and deaminized gliadin immunoglobulins A and G are sensitive screening tools, but approximately 10% of celiac disease are seronegative, and serological tests are unreliable in the very young, and in people Those already following a low-gluten diet, and those using immunosuppressive medications. HLA DQA and DQB genotyping to show that alleles encoding HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are absent almost excludes celiac disease. Confirmation of histological remission reduces the risk of subsequent complications, such as osteoporosis and cancer. Monitoring remission by unreliable serology. Because gluten is an exogenous antigen and is readily accessible to the small intestine, the immunopathogenesis of celiac disease is better understood than other MHC class II-associated diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Therapeutic targets have been identified and drugs are being developed to complement or even replace the gluten-free diet. With increased awareness and non-dietary treatments, the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease will be increasingly prominent in medical practice.	Osteoporosis	HLA-DQ2			0
8156448	To investigate the role of IL-4 in vivo in allergic asthma, we developed a murine model of allergen-induced airway inflammation. Repeated daily exposure of actively immunized C57BL/6 mice to aerosolized ovalbumin (OVA) resulted in peribronchial inflammation and an increase in eosinophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. In IL-4-deficient (IL4 −/−) mice, treated in the same way, there were significantly fewer eosinophils in the BAL and significantly less peribronchial inflammation compared with wild-type mice. In this model, mast cell-deficient (W/Wv) mice developed a similar degree of BAL eosinophilia and peribronchial inflammation as wild-type mice, demonstrating that mast cell is not required for the induction of chronic airway inflammation. In contrast, BAL eosinophilia and airway inflammation were absent in OVA-treated MHC ClassII-deficient (B6.Aa-/-) mice that lack mature CD4 + T lymphocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that IL-4 is a central mediator of allergic airway inflammation, regulating antigen-induced eosinophil recruitment into the airways via a T cell-dependent mechanism.

22079492	IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are thought to have an essential role in the allergic response to asthma. Previous work assumes that the primary source of these cytokines is CD4(+) T(H)2 cells. However, more recent studies have suggested that other innate production of type 2 cytokines may be equally important. Nuclear cells are a novel population of IL-13-producing innate cells, which are essential for protective immunity in Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection. Given this, we investigated the possible presence of nuclear cells and their functional importance in experimental allergic asthma. We generated Il4(+/eGFP)Il13(+/Tomato) dual reporter mice to study cytokine-producing cells during allergic inflammation. We adoptively transferred IL-13-producing innate cells to investigate their role in bronchial hyperreactivity (AHR). We have shown that allergen-triggered nucleated cells infiltrate the lung and constitute a major innate source of IL-13. CD4(+) T cells in the lung almost exclusively express only IL-13, whereas IL-4-producing T cells are restricted to draining lymph nodes. Intranasal administration of IL-25 or IL-33 induced IL-13-producing megakaryocytes in BAL fluid. Surprisingly, adoptive transfer of wild-type nuclear cells, but not Il13(-/-) nuclear cells, to Il13(-/-) mice, which are normally resistant to IL-25-induced AHR, restored bronchial resistance and infiltration. Lung cells. These findings identify nucleated cells as a new cell type in allergic lung inflammation and an innate source of IL-13 that can directly stimulate AHR in the absence of IL-13-producing CD4(+) T cells. These data highlight nuclear cells as an important new consideration in the development of future treatment for allergic asthma.	Asthma	IL4			1
11709756	Asthma is a common respiratory disease characterized by variable airway obstruction caused by acute and chronic bronchitis. Associated phenotypes include bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and positive skin tests to common allergens. Binding of interleukin-13 (IL13) or interleukin-4 (IL4) to the IL4 receptor (IL4R) results in the initial response of Th2 lymphocyte polarization. Both IL13 and IL4 are produced by Th2 cells and are able to induce isotype switching of B cells to produce IgE after exposure to allergens. These cytokines also share a common receptor component, IL4R alpha. We investigated five IL4RA single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a cohort of Dutch families ascertained by asthma testing. By considering the subjects and their spouses as an unrelated sample, we observed significant associations between atopy and asthma phenotypes with several IL4RA polymorphisms, including S478P and serum total IgE levels ( P = .0007). A significant genetic–genetic interaction was detected between S478P in IL4RA and promoter variation -1111 in IL13, which was previously shown to be associated with BHR ( P = .003). Individuals with the at-risk genotype for both genes were approximately five times more likely to develop asthma than individuals with both non-at-risk genotypes (P = .0004). These data suggest that variations in IL4RA contribute to higher serum total IgE levels, and that the interaction between IL4RA and IL13 significantly increases an individual's susceptibility to developing asthma.

24075231	The three gene signatures of periostin, chloride channel annexin 1 (CLCA1), and Serpin β2 (SERPINB2) in the airway epithelial brush are used to classify asthma into high-TH2 and low-TH2 endophenotypes. Little is known about the utility of sputum genotyping as a molecular phenotyping method. We sought to determine whether genotyping in sputum cells could identify T(H)2-high and T(H)2-low asthma subtypes. In induced sputum cell pellets from 37 asthma patients and 15 healthy control subjects, PCR was used to profile gene expression of the epithelial cell signature of IL-13 activation (periostin, CLCA1, and SERPINB2), and Th2 genes (IL4, IL5, and IL13). ), and other genes associated with Th2 airway inflammation. Gene expression levels of CLCA1 and periostin, but not SerpinB2, were significantly higher than normal in the sputum cells of people with asthma. Expression levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were also significantly increased in asthma patients and were significantly correlated within individual subjects. By combining the expression levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 into a single quantitative measure (“average T(H)2 gene”), 26 (70%) of the 37 asthma patients had T(H) 2- High asthma, which is characterized by severe asthma symptoms and increased eosinophilia in the blood and sputum. Mean values ​​of the TH2 gene tend to be stable when initial values ​​are very high or very low but fluctuate above or below the maximum height of T(H)2 when initial values ​​are average. Transcripts of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 can be easily detected in sputum cells of asthma patients, and their expression levels can be used to classify asthma into high-T(H)2 and low-T(H)2 endophenotypes.

24722226	Chitin is an essential structural polysaccharide for fungal pathogens and parasites, but its role in human immune responses remains largely unknown. It is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose, and its derivatives are widely used today for medical and industrial purposes. We analyzed the immunomodulatory properties of purified chitin particles derived from the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, resulting in selective secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. We have identified NOD2, TLR9, and mannose receptors as essential fungal chitin recognition receptors for the induction of this response. Chitin reduces LPS-induced inflammation in vivo and thus may contribute to the resolution of the immune response once the pathogen is defeated. Fungal chitin also causes eosinophilia in vivo, enhancing its ability to induce asthma. Polymorphisms in specific chitin receptors, NOD2 and TLR9, predispose individuals to inflammatory conditions and dysregulated expression of chitinases and chitinase-related proteins, whose activity is essential for the generation of IL-10-stimulating innate chitin molecules in vitro, has also been linked to inflammatory conditions and asthma. Chitin recognition is therefore critical for immune homeostasis and likely has an important role in infectious and allergic diseases.	Asthma	NOD2			1
15990792	Interactions with microbial pathogens are critical for the maturation of the immune system. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) protein is a cytosolic receptor that senses a muropeptide found predominantly in Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. NOD1 is located on chromosome 7p14-p15, a region that has been linked to atopy. Recently, NOD2 polymorphisms have been closely associated with atopy-related traits. Within a large German adult population (n = 1417), a case-control group for atopic eczema (n = 454), and a large cohort of parent-offspring triads with atopic eczema (189 triads), we evaluated 11 NOD1 polymorphisms for associations with atopic patterns. . Methods Subjects were classified through standardized questionnaires and interviews, skin examination, and blood IgE measurements. Genotyping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Analyzes revealed a significant association between NOD1 haplotype and atopic eczema in the population-based cohort ( P = .004) and case-control group ( P = .003). Another NOD1 haplotype was associated with lower total IgE ( P = .008). In addition, significant associations with total serum IgE levels were observed for the rs2907748 ( P = .006), rs2907749 ( P = .012), and rs2075822 ( P = .018) polymorphisms. These polymorphisms were significantly associated with atopic eczema and asthma in familial association analyzes ( P = .001-.043). Seven polymorphisms showed significant transmission distortion of total IgE levels (P values ​​<.0001-.029). These data suggest that genetic variants within NOD1 are important determinants of atopy susceptibility.	Asthma	NOD2			0
24137163	Nucleotide and oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) are highly conserved cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that perform critical functions in scanning the intracellular environment for the presence of infections, harmful substances, and metabolic disturbances. Sensing of these danger signals by NLRs leads to their oligomerization into large molecular scaffolds and rapid deployment of effector signaling cascades to restore homeostasis. While some NLRs function by recruiting and activating inflammatory caspases to inflammasomes, others trigger inflammation via alternative pathways including nuclear factor-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and regulatory factor pathways. The critical role that NLRs play in development and physiology is demonstrated by their pronounced effects on human diseases. Mutations in the genes encoding NLRP3 or NLRP12 lead to hereditary periodic fever syndromes, while mutations in CARD15 encoding NOD2 are associated with Crohn's disease or Blau syndrome. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of risk alleles involving NLR genes in a range of diseases including allergic rhinitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, multibacillary leprosy, vitiligo, premature menopause, and osteoporosis. Loss of density in older women. Animal models have allowed the characterization of basic effector mechanisms in a number of conditions. In this review, we highlight the functions of NLRs in health and disease and discuss how characterization of their molecular mechanisms provides new insights into therapeutic strategies for managing inflammatory diseases.

15007629	In wealthy, developed parts of the world, there has been a steady and simultaneous increase in at least three groups of diseases: (1) allergies, (2) inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and (3) autoimmune (such as... Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis). Because the medical world is so divided, it will be some time before the relationship between these increases is noticed and understood. There is now evidence that the concurrent increase in these immune dysregulatory diseases is at least in part due to dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Treg). This paper provides an overview of relevant work in each of these areas of medicine (although with a focus on allergic disorders), and concludes that increased Treg failure is a consequence of diminished exposure to certain microorganisms that are “old friends.” Because of its constant presence throughout mammalian evolution. These organisms, which include saprophytic mycobacteria, helminths, and lactobacilli, are recognized by the innate immune system as harmless and as adjunctive to Treg induction. Polymorphisms in components of the innate immune system, such as TLR2 and NOD2, appear to define subgroups of the population that will develop immune regulatory disorders when living in the modern environment. An additional role played by these “old friends” and Treg may be to maintain the levels of IL-10 secreting regulatory macrophages and antigen-presenting cells, which are depleted in asthma and Crohn's disease. These concepts lead to new treatments based on harmless organisms or their components. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials have yielded some statistically significant results, and phase 2 trials are still in progress.	Asthma	NOD2			0
9623982	The action of tissue transglutaminase (TGase) on specific glutamine residues bound to protein plays a crucial role in many biological processes. Here we provide evidence for a novel role for this enzyme in HLA-DQ2 (and DQ8)-associated enteropathy and celiac disease (CD). Intestinal inflammation in CD is accelerated by exposure to wheat gliadin in the diet and is associated with increased mucosal TGase activity. This enzyme has also been identified as the main target of CD-associated anti-Indomysium autoantibodies, and is known to accept gliadin as one of its few substrates. We examined the possibility that TGase may be involved in modulating gliadin-specific T cell reactivity. This could establish a link between previous reports on the role of TGase in CD and the prevailing view of CD as a T-cell-mediated disorder. We found a specific effect of TGase on T cell recognition of gliadin. This effect was limited to gliadin-specific T cells isolated from intestinal CD lesions. We have demonstrated that TGase mediates its effect through a regulated and specific deubiquitination of gliadin. This immunoprecipitation creates an epitope that efficiently binds to DQ2 and is recognized by gut-derived T cells. The generation of epitopes via enzymatic modification is a novel mechanism that may be relevant to tolerance breaking and the initiation of autoimmune diseases.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DQ2			1
12815137	Wheat, rye and barley proteins trigger celiac disease, a type of autoimmune disorder of the digestive system, in genetically susceptible people. Because the disease may be underdiagnosed, we estimated the prevalence of the disease and tested the hypothesis that serum antibody assays can be used to detect untreated celiac disease and that positive results are associated with specific HLA haplotypes. Serum samples were collected from 3654 students (age range 7–16 years) in 1994 and screened in 2001 for endogenous and tissue transglutaminase antibodies. HLA typing was also performed on stored blood samples. All people with positive antibodies were asked to undergo a small bowel biopsy in 2001. Of the 3,654 people, 56 (1.5 percent) had positive antibody tests, as defined in 2001. The results of the two antibody tests were identical to an extent big. As of 1994, none of the subjects had received a clinical diagnosis of celiac disease, but 10 who had positive tests for both antibodies in serum obtained in 1994 had received the diagnosis between 1994 and 2001. Of the other 36 subjects with tests Positive for antibodies who consented to undergo a biopsy In 2001, 27 people had evidence of celiac disease on the biopsy. Thus, the biopsy-estimated prevalence was 1 case in 99 children. All but two of the people with the antibodies had either the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotype. The prevalence of the combination of antibody positivity and HLA haplotype associated with celiac disease was 1 in 67. The presence of serum tissue transglutaminase and endogenous autoantibodies is suggestive of small bowel abnormalities suggestive of celiac disease. There is a good correlation between antibody positivity and specific HLA patterns. We estimate that the prevalence of celiac disease among Finnish schoolchildren is at least 1 case in 99 children.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DQ2			1
10684852	The vast majority of patients who are wheat gluten protein intolerant due to celiac disease (CD) are human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2(+), and the remaining few typically express HLA-DQ8. These two class II molecules are mainly responsible for presenting gluten peptides to gluten-specific T cells which are only found in the intestine of CD patients but not in controls. Interestingly, tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-mediated deglutaminase plays an important role in the recognition of this food antigen by intestinal T cells. Here we have used recombinant antigens to demonstrate that the intestinal T cell response to α-gliadin in adult CD focuses on two DQ2-restricted immunogenic peptides that overlap a seven-residue fragment of gliadin. We have shown that tTG converts glutamine residues within this fragment into glutamic acid and that this process is essential for T cell recognition. Gluten-specific T cell lines from 16 different adult patients responded to one or both of these deamidated peptides, suggesting that these epitopes are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. Binding studies showed that deamidated peptides showed increased affinity for DQ2, a molecule known to preferentially bind peptides and which contains negatively charged residues. Interestingly, modified glutamine is internalized into different pockets of DQ2 for different epitopes. These results suggest modifications to anchor residues lead to improved major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affinity, and altered conformation of the peptide-MHC complex may be a critical factor leading to T cell responses to gliadin and intolerance to oral gluten.

21224837	Although prescriptions for a gluten-free diet to treat gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease are increasing, there is little evidence to suggest that gluten is the culprit. The goals of this study were to determine whether eating gluten can cause symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was performed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was ruled out and whose symptoms were controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two slices of bread plus one bagel per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were assessed using a visual analogue scale and signs of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study according to protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of the 19 patients (68%) in the gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 (40%) who took placebo (P = 0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On the visual analog scale, patients were significantly gluten-free at 1 week for overall symptoms (P = 0.047), pain (P = 0.016), bloating (P = 0.031), satisfaction with stool consistency (P = 0.024), and fatigue. (p = 0.001). Antibodies to gliadin were not induced. There were no significant changes in stool lactoferrin, celiac antibody levels, hypersensitivity C-reactive protein, or intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any endpoint in individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. There may be a “non-celiac gluten intolerance,” but no evidence of the mechanism has been elucidated.

9027962	Genomic typing for HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 was performed for 50 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and 290 healthy blood donors. Genes encoding DQ (alpha 1*0501, beta 1*02) were carried by 43 (86%) patients and 72 (25%) controls. Of the remaining seven patients, six (12% of all patients) carried genes encoding the DQ dimer (alpha 1*03, beta 1*0302). These HLA associations are very similar to those observed in patients with celiac disease. We therefore conclude that dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease are associated with the same HLA-DQ alpha beta variant.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DRB1			0
12121676	The role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 heterodimer (DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201) in presenting gluten peptides to effector T cells has been well documented in celiac disease (CD). Because HLA-DQ2 is carried on DR3 haplotypes due to linkage disequilibrium, such haplotypes are more frequently encountered in patients with autoimmune diseases. This study analyzed 35 north Indian children younger than 15 years of age who were diagnosed with CD according to the ESPGAN criteria, which included histological changes in duodenal biopsies, clinical response to gluten withdrawal, and the presence of anti-endothelin antibodies. HLA class I and class II alleles were identified by PCR-specific primers, sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, and reverse transcriptase molecular techniques. Statistically significant positive association of disease with HLA-DRB1*03 (94.2% vs. 22.1% in controls, chi(2) = 73.4, p = 7.54E-11), and negative association with DRB1*15 (chi(2) ) = 7.4 , p = 6.5E-03) and DRB1*13 alleles were observed. HLA-DQB1*0201 was observed in all 35 patients (100%), while the presence of DQ2 heterodimer alpha(0)beta(0) occurred in 97.1% of CD patients (31.4% in double dose, 65.7% in single dose) It revealed a significant deviation from healthy controls (chi(2) = 102.08, p = 7.56E-11). Further analysis revealed the involvement of several DR3+ve haplotypes with CD in Indians, of which A26-B8-DR3 was the most common DR3 haplotype among patients (34.28%, chi(2) = 40.57, p = 2.65E- 10) followed by Ax-B21-DR3 (11.4%) (chi(2) = 13.8, p = 2E-04) and the classic Caucasian haplotype A1-B8-DR3 (5.7%). The former two haplotypes are characteristic of Asian Indians and are involved in the development of CD. We conclude that the high-risk DR3 haplotypes that play a critical role in the development of CD are unique to Asian Indians. Detailed analysis of these haplotypes in Indian patients with autoimmune diseases may help in understanding the influence of other involved genes within the major histocompatibility complex.

11112362	From 1991 to 1998, we vaccinated 4835 neonates against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and monitored their humoral response to the recombinant vaccine. In a sample of 184 of these children, we studied the association between HLA class I and II genomic polymorphisms and humoral response to vaccine and the association between immune response and disease. A subgroup of 96 children also underwent HLA class III typing (C4A and C4B). Four levels of humoral response have been identified, each with peculiar major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. Different HLA products appear to act as agonists (C4AQ0, HLA-DQB1(*)02) or antagonists (C4AQ0, HLA-DQB1(*)02, and HLA-DRB1(*)11, DQB1(*)0301) in lowering humorality. Response to hepatitis B virus vaccine. The group of responders was characterized by a lack of “non-responder” alleles rather than by the presence of specific “responder” alleles. Tolerance to hepatitis B virus peptides may have clinical implications and may be a marker in children who have a genetic risk for autoimmune diseases. In fact, many poor responders carried two to four HLA-DQ alpha beta variants leading to insulin-dependent diabetes and celiac disease. Two true non-responders suffered from allergies and two slow responders had transient episodes of hyperglycemia.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DRB1			0
10773355	The possibility that genetic susceptibility to celiac disease (CD) is influenced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene polymorphisms has been repeatedly raised. To date, this has only been investigated in case-control studies and results have been contradictory. In order to avoid any potential ethnic mismatch between patients and controls, we approached this issue by studying 71 celiac families, establishing parental haplotypes and comparing CD haplotypes versus control haplotypes (so-called AFBAC or affected family controls). We used DNA-based approaches to screen HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 alleles, TNFalpha promoter polymorphisms, and TNFa and b microsatellites. A guanine to adenine polymorphism at position -308 in the TNFalpha gene promoter region was found to be associated with CD where the TNF-308A allele appeared significantly in frequency in CD haplotypes, and this was shown to be independent of the association between CD and DRB1 alleles. *0301,DQA1*0501,DQB1*0201. Our results suggest that at least one other gene, in addition to the known association of CD with HLA class II, has a susceptibility role to this disease. This must be either TNFalpha or another polymorphic gene at the telomeric end of the HLA class III region.	Celiac Disease	HLA-DRB1			1
21833088	Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous system in which the interplay between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes usually results in intermittent neurological disorder followed by a progressive accumulation of disability. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the significant increase in disease recurrence in relatives of affected individuals, and systematic attempts to identify links in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest influence. Individual influence on risk. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the identification of more than 20 additional risk loci and shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a major role in disease susceptibility. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be determined, and is expected to require analysis of sample sizes that exceed the numbers currently available for individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS study including 9772 cases of European origin collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we replicated almost all previously proposed associations and identified at least 29 new susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immuneologically relevant genes are overrepresented among those genes close to the identified loci, especially T helper cell differentiation in MS pathogenesis.	Multiple Sclerosis	HLA-DRB1			1
7680433	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which a restricted cellular immune response is observed. In order to determine whether these T-cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with respect to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analyzed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. transcribed messenger RNA (RNA), and compared them with TCR clones for MBP-specific T cells described previously from an MS and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis murine model. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients with HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. Beta V beta 5,2-D beta-J sequences in MS brain plaques revealed five isoforms. One common element was identical to that described for the VDJ region of the V beta 5.2 T cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient that was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and was cytotoxic toward targets containing the MBP peptide. 89-106 (Ref. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in murine T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which is specific for the MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with this MBP loop specificity account for a significant fraction (40%) of TCR V beta 5.2(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The ability of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in human demyelinated lesions suggest that T cells with rearranged TCRs may be critical in MS.

21478203	There is a striking gradient in the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS), but exceptions in Mediterranean Europe and northern Scandinavia, and some systematic reviews, suggest that the gradient may be an artifact. The authors sought to evaluate the relationship between MS prevalence and latitude through meta-regression. Studies were obtained from online databases, reference mining, and author referral. Prevalence estimates were age-standardized for the European population in 2009. Analyzes were performed by random-effects meta-regression, weighted with the inverse of the within-study variance. The authors included 650 prevalence estimates from 321 peer-reviewed studies; Of these, 239 were standardized by age, and 159 provided sex-specific data. The researchers found a significant positive association (change in prevalence by degree of latitude) between age-standardized prevalence (1.04, p<0.001) and latitude that diminished at higher latitudes. Adjusting for year of spread strengthened the association with latitude (2.60, p<0.001). The inverse gradient was reversed in the Italian region when adjusting for MS-associated HLA-DRB1 allele distributions. Adjusting for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies did not significantly change the gradient in Europe. Adjusting for some potential sources of bias did not affect the observed associations. This most comprehensive review of MS prevalence to date confirmed a statistically significant positive relationship between MS prevalence and latitude globally. The exceptions to phasing in the Italian region and northern Scandinavia are likely the result of genetic, behavioral and cultural differences. The persistence of a positive gradient in Europe after adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies strongly supports the role of environmental factors that vary with latitude, the most prominent candidates being ultraviolet radiation (UVR)/vitamin D.

19197344	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex trait in which allelic variation in the MHC class II region exerts the strongest influence on genetic risk. Epidemiological data in MS provide strong evidence that environmental factors act at the population level to influence the unusual geographic distribution of this disease. Increasing evidence points to sunlight or vitamin D as a major environmental factor in its aetiology. We hypothesized that this environmental filter might interact with inherited factors and sought responsive regulatory elements in the MHC class II region. Sequence analysis identified a single MHC vitamin D response element (VDRE) to the promoter region of HLA-DRB1. Sequencing of this promoter in more than 1000 chromosomes of HLA-DRB1 homozygotes showed absolute conservation of the putative VDRE over HLA-DRB1*15 haplotypes. In contrast, there was striking variation among non-MS haplotypes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific recruitment of vitamin D receptors to the VDRE in the HLA-DRB1*15 promoter, which was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using lymphoblasts homozygous for HLA-DRB1*15. Transient transfection using a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated a functional role for this VDRE. B cells transiently transfected with the HLA-DRB1*15 gene promoter showed increased expression upon stimulation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (P = 0.002) that was lost when the VDRE was deleted or with the homologous “VDRE” sequence found in non-HLA haplotypes. -DRB1 associated with MS. Flow cytometric analysis showed a specific increase in cell surface expression of HLA-DRB1 upon vitamin D addition only in lymphoblasts bearing HLA-DRB1*15. This study further points to vitamin D as a strong environmental candidate in MS by demonstrating direct functional interaction with a key locus that determines genetic susceptibility. These findings support a relationship between the main epidemiological and genetic features of this disease with major practical implications for studies of disease mechanism and prevention.

12114036	Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, in such populations, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely independent of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary artery disease, other arterial-occlusive disease or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive simvastatin 40 mg daily (median compliance: 85%) or placebo Matched (average statin use without study: 17%). ). Analyzes are first performed for specific events, comparing all participants assigned to simvastatin versus all participants assigned to placebo. These “intention-to-treat” comparisons evaluate the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which resulted in a mean difference in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (About two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg of simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or nonfatal vascular events (for subgroup analyses), with subcategories for cancer and other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1,328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 simvastatin assigned vs. 1,507 [14.7%] among 10,267 placebo assigned; P = 0.0003), due to a very significant relative reduction of 18%. (SE 5) in coronary mortality (587 [5.7%] vs. 707 [6.9%]; P = 0.0005), and a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs. 230 [2.2%]; P = 0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular mortality (547 [5.3%] versus 570 [5.6%]; P = 0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] versus 1212 [11.8%]; P < 0.0001), for nonfatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%]). vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularization (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a significant 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in event rate (2033 [19.8%] versus 2585 [25.2%] of affected individuals; p < 0.0001 ). During the first year, the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but was subsequently very large during each separate year. The relative reduction in event rate was similar (and significant) in every subgroup of participants studied, including: those who were not diagnosed with coronary artery disease and who had cerebrovascular disease, had peripheral artery disease, or They had diabetes; Men and women separately; Those aged 70 or over at entry; And - especially - even those with LDL cholesterol less than 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol less than 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardiac treatments. The excess annual risk of myopathy with this regimen was approximately 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalization for any reason other than vascular. Adding simvastatin to existing therapies safely results in significant additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, regardless of their initial cholesterol concentrations. An assignment of 40 mg of simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization by about a quarter. After accounting for non-compliance, actual use of this system would likely reduce these rates by about a third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individuals studied, taking simvastatin for 5 years would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should to more benefits). The magnitude of the 5-year benefit is based primarily on these individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, not on blood lipid concentrations alone.	Peripheral Artery Disease		Simvastatin		1

For heart failure. In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, 4444 patients with coronary heart disease without evidence of heart failure were randomized to placebo (n = 2223) or simvastatin 20-40 mg (n = 2221) and followed for more than 5 years. Among patients who received placebo, 228 (10.3%) were diagnosed with heart failure during follow-up evaluation compared with 184 (8.3%) of patients who received simvastatin (P < .015). The mortality rate was 31.9% in the placebo group and 25.5% in the simvastatin group among patients who developed heart failure. These compare with 9.2 and 6.6%, respectively, among patients without heart failure. There were 45 hospitalizations for acute heart failure in the placebo group and 23 in the simvastatin (NS) group. Patients who developed heart failure were more likely to have recurrent myocardial infarction and to have a history of diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension compared to patients who did not develop congestive heart failure. Long-term prophylaxis with simvastatin reduces the incidence of heart failure in a group of patients with coronary heart disease without previous evidence of congestive heart failure.
