15	15	29372117	Expression of APPAT plays no role in the development of atherosclerosis	APPAT	Atherosclerosis	0	"The abstract does not support the statement that ""Expression of APPAT plays no role in the development of atherosclerosis."" Instead, it provides evidence that APPAT may indeed play a significant role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Here's how the abstract supports APPAT's involvement:

1. **Identification and Evaluation of APPAT**: The abstract discusses the identification of a new circulating long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) called APPAT, specifically associated with atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis. The study focuses on evaluating APPAT's role in atherosclerosis and its potential as a biomarker.

2. **Expression Patterns and Localization**: APPAT was examined for its expression in vitro (in cell culture models) and in vivo (in human samples), with its distribution and subcellular location determined using immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH). This detailed examination helps in understanding the functional contexts in which APPAT operates, particularly noting that it is enriched in contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the artery tunica media and primarily exists in the cytoplasm.

3. **Alterations in Disease States**: The study found that APPAT expression was significantly down-regulated in coronary artery samples with severe stenosis and also in blood samples from patients as the disease progressed (from healthy individuals to those with angina pectoris or myocardial infarction). This trend of decreased APPAT expression correlating with worsening atherosclerotic condition strongly suggests a functional role in the disease's pathogenesis.

4. **Predictive Capability**: The abstract mentions that the study explored APPAT's ability to predict the risk of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and correlation analyses verifying its relatively high predictive ability. This predictive utility further underscores the biological relevance of APPAT in atherosclerosis.

5. **Interaction with miRNAs**: The study also investigated the microRNA targets of APPAT, finding that the expression of a predicted miRNA target exhibited an opposite direction to that of APPAT. This interaction suggests a regulatory network involving APPAT that could impact cellular functions relevant to atherosclerosis.

6. **Conclusion**: The study concludes that APPAT likely performs an important function in the development of atherosclerosis, based on its expression patterns, regulatory interactions, and changes observed in pathological states.

In summary, the abstract provides substantial evidence that APPAT is functionally involved in atherosclerosis, contradicting the statement that it plays no role. The findings suggest that APPAT has both a mechanistic role in the disease and potential utility as a biomarker for its progression."	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to modulate cardiovascular diseases, and expression dynamics of lncRNAs in the bloodstream were proposed to be potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. However, few cardiovascular diseases-related circulating lncRNAs were identified and their prediction power has not been investigated in depth. Here we report a new circulating lncRNA, <i>atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis associated transcript</i> (<i>APPAT</i>), and evaluated its role and predicting ability in atherosclerotic development. <i>APPAT</i> was analyzed and screened by high-throughput sequencing, and then detected <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH) was utilized to explore distribution and subcellular location of <i>APPAT</i>. The expressing alteration of <i>APPAT</i> in samples of healthy and pathological coronary artery was explored further. We also assessed the level of circulating <i>APPAT</i> in blood samples from healthy individuals, and patients with angina pectoris (AP) or myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, we predicted and validated microRNA targets of <i>APPAT</i>, then showed the expression level of a candidate target which was primarily measured in human VSMCs cell line, coronary artery, and blood samples. Lastly, we examined the potential indicating ability of <i>APPAT</i> for the risk of AP or MI. <i>APPAT</i> showed significant reduction in ox-LDL treated human VSMCs <i>in vitro</i>. It enriched in contractile VSMCs of artery tunica media and mainly existed in cytoplasm. Significant down-regulation of <i>APPAT</i> was found in coronary artery samples with severe stenosis. More importantly, we observed decreased expression of <i>APPAT</i> in blood samples accompanying disease progression. ROC and correlation analyses further verified the relatively high predicting ability of <i>APPAT</i>. We also observed the predicted miRNA exhibited opposite expression direction to that of <i>APPAT</i>. This study revealed that circulating lncRNA-<i>APPAT</i> may perform an important function and have some indicating ability on the development of atherosclerosis.
50	50	34423300	Mutations in LAMA1 correlate with Joubert Syndrome	LAMA1	Joubert Syndrome	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in LAMA1 correlate with Joubert Syndrome. Instead, it establishes that mutations in LAMA1 are associated with a different, though somewhat similar, condition known as Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Here’s a breakdown of the abstract’s findings and how they relate to the statement:

1. **Diagnosis and Genetic Findings**: The abstract describes the investigation of several families that were initially considered to have Joubert syndrome based on clinical diagnoses. However, genetic analysis did not support this; instead, pathogenic variants in LAMA1 were detected, which are associated with Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome, not Joubert syndrome.

2. **Radiological Differences**: The patients did not exhibit the ""molar tooth sign"" on brain MRI, which is a hallmark of Joubert syndrome. Instead, they showed cerebellar dysplasia and cerebellar cysts, features typical of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. This further differentiates the two conditions and highlights the importance of precise radiological assessment in distinguishing between them.

3. **Implications for Genetic Testing**: The researchers advocate for the inclusion of LAMA1 genetic testing in panels for intellectual disability and Joubert syndrome due to the potential for clinical overlap and misdiagnosis, indicating that while LAMA1 mutations do not cause Joubert syndrome, they are important in the differential diagnosis of similar syndromes.

4. **Prevalence Data**: The abstract provides prevalence data, underscoring the rarity of both conditions but does not link LAMA1 mutations to Joubert syndrome. Instead, it emphasizes the need for awareness and accurate diagnosis of related but distinct conditions.

5. **Conclusion on Misdiagnosis**: The conclusion about delayed diagnoses due to poor recognition of key radiological features and the absence of LAMA1 in genetic testing panels further supports the notion that while LAMA1-related conditions may mimic Joubert syndrome, they are genetically and clinically distinct.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract clarifies that mutations in LAMA1 are linked to Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome and not Joubert syndrome, thus refuting the statement that mutations in LAMA1 correlate with Joubert syndrome. This distinction is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of these pediatric neurology syndromes."	Paediatric neurology syndromes are a broad and complex group of conditions with a large spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Joubert syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous neurological ciliopathy syndrome with molar tooth sign as the neuroimaging hallmark. We reviewed the clinical, radiological and genetic data for several families with a clinical diagnosis of Joubert syndrome but negative genetic analysis. We detected biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>LAMA1</i>, including novel alleles, in each of the four cases we report, thereby establishing a firm diagnosis of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Analysis of brain MRI revealed cerebellar dysplasia and cerebellar cysts, associated with Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome and the absence of typical molar tooth signs. Using large UK patient cohorts, the relative prevalence of Joubert syndrome as a cause of intellectual disability was 0.2% and of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome was 0.02%. We conclude that children with congenital brain disorders that mimic Joubert syndrome may have a delayed diagnosis due to poor recognition of key features on brain imaging and the lack of inclusion of <i>LAMA1</i> on molecular genetic gene panels. We advocate the inclusion of <i>LAMA1</i> genetic analysis on all intellectual disability and Joubert syndrome gene panels and promote a wider awareness of the clinical and radiological features of these syndromes.
86	86	17376622	TAC! mutations correlate with autism	TAC1	Autism	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that ""TAC1 mutations correlate with autism."" Here's why:

1. **Study Outcome**: The study specifically investigated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Tachykinin 1 gene (TAC1) and autism. Despite TAC1 being located in a candidate region for autism and its products being involved in modulating glutamatergic synaptic transmission and inflammation (both relevant to autism pathology), the study found no significant difference in allele or haplotype frequencies between autistic patients and normal controls in the Japanese population.

2. **Lack of Genetic Association**: The results indicate that the TAC1 locus is not likely to play a major role in the development of autism, at least within the population studied. This finding directly contradicts the statement that TAC1 mutations correlate with autism, as no significant genetic correlation was identified.

3. **Population Specificity**: The study was conducted in a specific population (Japanese), and it is possible that findings could vary in different genetic backgrounds. However, based on the data presented in this abstract, there is no support for the assertion that mutations in TAC1 are associated with autism in this population.

Thus, the abstract clearly states that based on their findings, TAC1 does not appear to be a major factor in autism, directly opposing the idea that TAC1 mutations correlate with the condition."	Autism (MIM 209850) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disturbances in social interaction and communication, by repetitive body movements and restricted interests, and by atypical language development. Several twin and family studies have shown strong evidence for genetic factors in the etiology of autism. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. Glutamate systems are involved in the pathophysiology of autism. There are many similarities between the symptoms evoked by glutamate antagonist treatment and symptoms of autism found in several human and animal studies. To elucidate the genetic background of autism, we analyzed the relationship between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Tachykinin 1 gene (TAC1) and autism, because TAC1 is located in the candidate region for autism and produces substance P and neurokinins. These products modulate glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission and are also involved in inflammation. Many different inflammation-related mechanisms could be involved in the autistic brain. Therefore, TAC1 may have some functions associated with the presumable pathophysiology of autism. We compared the allele and haplotype frequencies between autistic patients (n=170) and normal controls (n=214) in the Japanese population, but no significant difference was observed. Thus, the TAC1 locus is not likely to play a major role in the development of autism.
76	76	37469105	Mutations in ODC1 cause Bachmann-Bupp syndrome	ODC1	Bachmann-Bupp syndrome	1	"This biomedical abstract does support the statement that mutations in the ODC1 gene cause Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS). Here are the specific reasons based on the details provided in the abstract:

1. **Gene Mutation Identification**: The abstract clearly states that Bachmann-Bupp syndrome is caused by 3'-end mutations in the ODC1 gene. These mutations lead to the production of carboxy (C)-terminally truncated variants of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme.

2. **Impact of the Mutation**: It explains that the truncation prevents the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of the ODC enzyme, resulting in its accumulation within cells. This accumulated enzyme remains catalytically active, which disrupts normal cellular functions.

3. **Connection to Disease Mechanism**: The abstract links the accumulation of active ODC to the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, where ODC catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine, a key step in the synthesis of polyamines. Polyamines are critical for various physiological processes including embryogenesis and organogenesis, implying that their dysregulation due to ODC accumulation could contribute to the symptoms observed in BABS.

4. **Clinical Relevance and Treatment**: Further supporting the causal role of ODC1 mutations in BABS, the abstract discusses the use of α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an ODC inhibitor, in treating patients with BABS. The reported clinical improvements in hair growth, muscle tone, and development upon treatment with DFMO provide practical evidence of the link between ODC1 mutations and the syndrome.

5. **Overall Contribution to Knowledge**: The description of the syndrome and its association with ODC1 mutations adds valuable insight into the genetic and molecular basis of BABS, emphasizing the role of ODC1 as critical in its pathogenesis.

In summary, the abstract supports the statement by detailing how mutations in ODC1 lead to the production of a dysfunctional protein that contributes directly to the phenotype of Bachmann-Bupp syndrome and how targeting this pathway can mitigate some of the clinical symptoms."	Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and varying forms of non-congenital alopecia. The condition is caused by 3'-end mutations of the ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene, which produce carboxy (C)-terminally truncated variants of ODC, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme. C-terminal truncation of ODC prevents its ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and leads to cellular accumulation of ODC enzyme that remains catalytically active. ODC is the first rate-limiting enzyme that converts ornithine to putrescine in the polyamine pathway. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are aliphatic molecules found in all forms of life and are important during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. BABS is an ultra-rare condition with few reported cases, but it serves as a convincing example for drug repurposing therapy. α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, also known as eflornithine) is an ODC inhibitor with a strong safety profile in pediatric use for neuroblastoma and other cancers as well as West African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Patients with BABS have been treated with DFMO and have shown improvement in hair growth, muscle tone, and development.
2	2	26932604	Expression of STOML2 is associated with asthma risk	STOML2	Asthma	1	"This biomedical abstract provides direct support for the statement that the expression of STOML2 is associated with asthma risk. Here’s a breakdown of how it supports this claim:

1. **Initial Hypothesis and Approach**: The researchers hypothesized that genes co-expressed with the IL6R gene, which is known to be associated with asthma risk, might also be influenced by genetic polymorphisms linked to asthma. This sets the basis for investigating the relationship between STOML2 expression and asthma, given its correlation with IL6R.

2. **Gene Expression Analysis**: The study involved analyzing gene expression data from two significant datasets to find genes whose expression correlated with IL6R. This methodology is robust and allows for the identification of genes potentially involved in similar pathways or mechanisms as IL6R.

3. **Identification of Correlated Genes and SNPs**: The researchers identified 90 genes correlated with IL6R expression. They further screened these genes for nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that not only affected gene expression but were also associated with asthma risk according to asthma genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This dual-criteria screening is crucial as it links gene expression changes directly to disease risk.

4. **Specific Findings for STOML2**: Among the genes identified, STOML2 was highlighted as a novel gene associated with asthma risk. The expression of STOML2 was found to be negatively correlated with IL6R, and the SNPs increasing STOML2 expression were associated with higher asthma risk. This specific finding directly links increased expression of STOML2 with an increased risk of developing asthma.

5. **Replication and Validation**: The significance of these findings is strengthened by the replication of the SNP-expression-risk association in an independent asthma GWAS dataset. This replication is critical for validating the initial findings and confirming the robustness of the association between STOML2 expression and asthma risk.

6. **Conclusion and Role of STOML2**: The conclusion that STOML2 expression is associated with asthma risk is supported by its role in mitochondrial function and T-cell activation, both of which are relevant to asthma pathology. The link to IL-6 signaling, a well-known pathway involved in inflammation and asthma, further supports the biological plausibility of STOML2's role in asthma.

In summary, the abstract provides strong evidence that the expression of STOML2 is associated with an increased risk of asthma, making a clear case for its role in the disease's pathogenesis based on both genetic and expression analysis, along with replication in independent studies."	Functional variants in the interleukin-6 receptor gene (IL6R) are associated with asthma risk. We hypothesized that genes co-expressed with IL6R might also be regulated by genetic polymorphisms that are associated with asthma risk. The aim of this study was to identify such genes. To identify genes whose expression was correlated with that of IL6R, we analyzed gene expression levels generated for 373 human lymphoblastoid cell lines by the Geuvadis consortium and for 38 hematopoietic cell types by the Differentiation Map Portal (DMAP) project. Genes correlated with IL6R were then screened for nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with both variation in gene expression levels (eSNPs) and asthma risk. We identified 90 genes with expression levels correlated with those of IL6R and that also had a nearby eSNP associated with disease risk in a published asthma GWAS (N = 20 776). For 16 (18%) genes, the association between the eSNP and asthma risk replicated with the same direction of effect in a further independent published asthma GWAS (N = 27 378). Among the top replicated associations (FDR < 0.05) were eSNPs for four known (IL18R1, IL18RAP, BCL6, and STAT6) and one putative novel asthma risk gene, stomatin-like protein 2 (STOML2). The expression of STOML2 was negatively correlated with IL6R, while eSNPs that increased the expression of STOML2 were associated with an increased asthma risk. The expression of STOML2, a gene that plays a key role in mitochondrial function and T-cell activation, is associated with both IL-6 signaling and asthma risk.
22	22	21727647	A mutation in IL-10 decreases the risk of hepatitis C virus infections	IL-10	Hepatitis C Virus	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in IL-10 decreases the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Instead, it suggests a complex interaction between different polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene and susceptibility to HCV, with some polymorphisms potentially increasing susceptibility and others possibly having a protective effect. Here’s how the abstract relates to this topic:

1. **Study Focus**: The study investigates the association between IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to HCV infection in a Pakistani population. IL-10 is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress immune responses, including those against HCV.

2. **Genetic Variants Examined**: Specifically, the polymorphisms studied are located in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene (-1082 G/A, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A). These polymorphisms can affect IL-10 production, which in turn might influence the immune system's ability to combat HCV.

3. **Methodology and Results**:
   - **Genotyping was performed** using ARMS-PCR for the mentioned IL-10 polymorphisms.
   - **Association findings**: There was a suggestive association at the allele level for the -819 C/T (-592 C/A) polymorphism with HCV infection (p=0.03), but not at the genotype level. This could indicate a more nuanced role of allele-specific expression rather than broad genotype effects.
   - **No association was found** for the -1082 allele, but the GG genotype at this site showed a positive association with HCV, suggesting increased susceptibility, not decreased risk.
   - **Haplotype and diplotype analysis** revealed higher frequencies of certain haplotypes and diplotypes in HCV patients compared to controls. Interestingly, the GCC/ATA diplotype appeared to have a protective effect against HCV, aligning more closely with the initial statement about decreasing risk but specific to this genetic combination only.

4. **Conclusions of the Study**: The study concludes that variations in the IL-10 promoter region affect the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, which influences HCV susceptibility. This indicates that while some IL-10 promoter mutations might reduce the risk of HCV, others could increase it, depending on the specific alleles and their expression profiles.

In summary, the abstract suggests that while certain IL-10 gene polymorphisms (specifically the GCC/ATA diplotype) might decrease the risk of HCV infections, others can increase susceptibility. Therefore, the statement that a mutation in IL-10 decreases the risk of hepatitis C virus infections is too broad and not universally supported by the findings presented in the abstract. Instead, the effect of IL-10 polymorphisms on HCV susceptibility is shown to be more complex and dependent on the specific alleles and combinations thereof."	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) commonly causes a chronic infection but few of patients are able to clear the virus naturally. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the immune response against HCV. Interindividual variations in IL-10 production are genetically contributed by polymorphisms within the IL-10 promoter region. This study aimed to investigate the association of the IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G/A, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A polymorphisms with HCV infection susceptibility in Pakistani individuals. Eighty-nine chronically infected patients and 99 controls were enrolled in the study. IL-10 (-1,082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A) genotyping was performed by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). A suggestive evidence of association with hepatitis C was obtained for the IL-10 -819 C/T (-592 C/A) (p: 0.03) promoter polymorphism at the allele level  but not in genotype distribution. The IL-10 -1082 allele showed no association while positive association of GG (p: 0.001) gene and negative association for GA (0.001) gene were observed.  Higher frequencies were observed for GTA (p: 0.02), ACC (p: 0.01) haplotype and GCC/GTA (p: 0.005) diplotype in HCV patients than controls while diplotype GCC/ATA showed protective effect against HCV. Our findings suggest that different IL-10 gene polymorphisms may lead to an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses which may in turn influence the susceptibility to HCV infection.
78	78	30239107	Mutations of ODC1 is proven to correlate with alopecia	ODC1	alopecia	0	"The biomedical abstract provides evidence that mutations in the ODC1 gene are associated with alopecia among other symptoms, but it doesn't unequivocally prove that ODC1 mutations are a direct and consistent cause of alopecia in all cases. Here’s why:

1. **Single Case Report**: The abstract discusses a single case of a patient with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene exhibiting multiple symptoms, including alopecia. While this case strongly suggests a link between the ODC1 mutation and alopecia, it's important to note that proof of correlation in a broader sense would require data from multiple cases and ideally, a larger population study.

2. **Phenotypic Variability**: The patient described shows a range of symptoms (macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, etc.), indicating that the ODC1 mutation has diverse effects, which could vary widely between individuals. The occurrence of alopecia along with other varied symptoms suggests a complex interaction of genetic and possibly environmental factors.

3. **Functional Evidence**: The mutation results in elevated levels of ODC protein and polyamines, which are known to be involved in cell growth and differentiation processes. This supports the notion that disruptions in these pathways could contribute to abnormal tissue development, including hair follicle function. However, the specific mechanisms by which the ODC1 mutation leads to alopecia are not detailed, and the direct causative pathway remains to be fully elucidated.

4. **Comparison with Animal Models**: The reference to similar symptoms in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model helps strengthen the case that the mutation could contribute to the observed human phenotype, including alopecia. However, translating findings from animal models to humans always requires careful validation.

5. **Therapeutic Insight**: Mention of potential treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine (an ODC inhibitor) suggests a functional link between ODC activity and the disease phenotype. If this treatment is effective, particularly in alleviating alopecia, it could further support the role of ODC1 in this condition.

In summary, the abstract provides compelling evidence for a possible link between a specific mutation in ODC1 and alopecia within the context of a complex multisymptom disorder in one patient. However, it stops short of proving a broad, consistent correlation between ODC1 mutations and alopecia across a wider population, highlighting the need for further research to establish a definitive causal relationship."	The ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene plays an important role in physiological and cell developmental processes including embryogenesis, organogenesis, and neoplastic cell growth. Here, we report an 32-month-old Caucasian female with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene that leads to a premature abrogation of 14-aa residues at the ODC protein c-terminus. This is the first human case confirming similar symptoms observed in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model first described over 20 years ago. Phenotypic manifestations include macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, spasticity, hypotonia, cutaneous vascular malformation, delayed visual maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. We here describe for the first time a new pediatric disorder that is directly linked to a de novo pathogenic variant in the ODC1 gene. The ODC1 gene mutation (c.1342 A>T) was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Red blood cells obtained from our patient showed elevated ODC protein and polyamine levels compared to healthy controls. Our autosomal dominant patient who carries this gain-of-function ODC1 mutation may benefit from treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine, a well-tolerated, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA-approved drug.
12	12	38007504	A mutation in A1BG affects resistance to Adriamycin	A1BG	Adriamycin	0	"The abstract does not directly support the statement that a mutation in A1BG affects resistance to Adriamycin (ADR), primarily because it does not discuss mutations in the A1BG gene itself. Instead, the abstract focuses on the role of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) known as A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1), which is related to but distinct from the A1BG gene. Here’s how the abstract relates to ADR resistance:

1. **Focus on A1BG-AS1**: The study centers on A1BG-AS1, an lncRNA that is upregulated in ADR-resistant breast cancer (BC) cell lines. While A1BG-AS1 is related to the A1BG gene, it functions as an RNA molecule rather than as a protein encoded by the A1BG gene itself.

2. **Mechanism of ADR Resistance**: The abstract explains that A1BG-AS1 enhances ADR resistance by positively regulating the expression of ABCB1, a gene known to be involved in drug resistance in cancer cells. This regulation occurs through the interaction with IGF2BP2, an m6A reader that stabilizes mRNA transcripts, including ABCB1's mRNA, in an m6A-dependent manner.

3. **Experimental Findings**: Key findings include that knockdown of A1BG-AS1 enhanced ADR sensitivity in BC cells, reduced their viability, proliferation, and migration, and facilitated apoptosis. Additionally, A1BG-AS1 silencing in xenograft mouse models inhibited tumor growth and alleviated ADR resistance.

4. **Implication of A1BG Gene**: Although the study involves an antisense RNA related to the A1BG gene, it does not address mutations in the A1BG gene itself or their direct impact on ADR resistance. The role described is specific to the antisense RNA (A1BG-AS1) and its regulation of another gene (ABCB1) involved in drug resistance.

5. **Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that A1BG-AS1, through its interaction with IGF2BP2, upregulates ABCB1, thereby enhancing ADR resistance in BC. This specific mechanism does not imply that mutations in the A1BG gene itself affect ADR resistance.

In summary, while the abstract demonstrates that A1BG-AS1 plays a significant role in mediating ADR resistance in breast cancer through the regulation of ABCB1 expression, it does not support the statement regarding mutations in the A1BG gene affecting ADR resistance. The focus is rather on the function of the antisense RNA and its impact on drug resistance mechanisms."	Adriamycin (ADR) resistance is an obstacle for chemotherapy of breast cancer (BC). ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) expression is indicated to be closely related to the drug resistance of cancer cells. The current work intended to explore the molecular mechanisms to regulate ABCB1 in BC cells with ADR resistance. We found that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) is upregulated in ADR resistant BC cell lines (MCF-7/ADR, MDA-MB-231/ADR). A1BG-AS1 knockdown enhanced the ADR sensitivity by suppressing the viability, proliferation potential and migration ability, and facilitating cell apoptosis in BC. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is known to be an m6A reader to modulate the stability of mRNA transcripts in an m6A-dependent manner, which was a shared RNA binding protein (RBP) for A1BG-AS1 and ABCB1. The interaction of IGF2BP2 with A1BG-AS1 or ABCB1 was explored and verified using RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. ABCB1 mRNA and protein expression was positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 and IGF2BP2 in BC cells. ABCB1 mRNA expression was stabilized by A1BG-AS1 via recruiting IGF2BP2 in an m6A-dependent manner. Moreover, rescue assays demonstrated that A1BG-AS1 enhanced BC ADR resistance by positively modulating ABCB1. Xenograft mouse models were used to explore whether A1BG-AS1 affected the ADR resistance in BC in vivo. The findings indicated that A1BG-AS1 silencing inhibited tumor growth and alleviated ADR resistance in vivo. In conclusion, A1BG-AS1 enhances the ADR resistance of BC by recruiting IGF2BP2 to upregulate ABCB1 in an m6A-dependent manner.
17	17	33753877	Mutations in MASP2 are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis	MASP2	tuberculosis	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that mutations in MASP2 are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). Here are the key points from the abstract that underpin this support:

1. **Study Objective and Design**: The study was designed to investigate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MASP2 gene and susceptibility to TB, as well as the interaction of these SNPs with tea drinking. The use of a large sample size (503 patients and 494 healthy controls) and specific SNPs (rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659) adds robustness to the study's findings.

2. **Genotyping and Statistical Analysis**: Three SNPs in the MASP2 gene were genotyped, and the association with TB susceptibility was analyzed using multivariate unconditional logistic regression, a method suited for identifying and quantifying the strength of associations between gene variants and disease.

3. **Findings on MASP2 SNPs**: The results indicated that certain genotypes at two of the SNPs studied (AC + AA at rs12711521 and GT + GG at rs7548659) were more prevalent in the TB patient group compared to the healthy control group. The odds ratios (ORs) reported (1.423 and 1.439, respectively, with P < 0.05) demonstrate a statistically significant association between these MASP2 gene variants and increased susceptibility to TB.

4. **Gene-Lifestyle Interaction**: The study also explored the interaction between tea drinking and the MASP2 SNPs. While the interaction terms (Relative Excess Risk of Interaction, RERI) indicated negative interactions, suggesting that tea drinking might modify the effect of the SNPs on TB risk, this does not diminish the overall finding that the SNPs themselves are associated with TB.

5. **Conclusion and Implications**: The study concludes that specific SNPs in the MASP2 gene are associated with TB susceptibility. This conclusion is supported by statistically significant findings and suggests that these genetic variations in the MASP2 gene could influence the individual's risk of developing TB.

Overall, the abstract provides clear evidence that mutations (or polymorphisms) in the MASP2 gene are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis, supporting the initial statement regarding genetic susceptibility linked to MASP2."	Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) has been reported to play an important role as a key enzyme in the lectin pathway of the complement system. The objectives of our study were to determine whether the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of MASP2 and the gene-tea drinking interaction were associated with the susceptibility to TB. In total, 503 patients and 494 healthy controls were contained. Three SNPs (rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659) were genotyped. The association between the SNPs and susceptibility to TB were investigated by conducting multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis. The gene-tea drinking interactions were analyzed by the additive model of marginal structural linear odds models. Both genotype AC + AA at rs12711521 of MASP2 genes and genotype GT + GG at rs7548659 of MASP2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (OR: 1.423 and 1.439, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between tea drinking and rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659 of MASP2 genes was found to suggest negative interactions, which reached - 0.2311 (95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.4736, - 0.0113), - 0.7080 (95% CI - 1.3998, - 0.0163), and - 0.5140 (95% CI - 0.8988, - 0.1291), respectively (P < 0.05). Our finding indicated that the SNPs (rs12711521 and rs7548659) of MASP2 were associated with the susceptibility to TB. Furthermore, there were negative interactions between tea drinking and rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs75548659 of MASP2 gene, respectively. Our research provides a basis for studying the pathogenesis and prevention of tuberculosis.
63	63	33931730	Mutations in NAGA affect susceptibility to schizophrenia	NAGA	schizophrenia	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that mutations in NAGA affect susceptibility to schizophrenia, particularly through the regulatory effects of genetic variants on NAGA expression. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Genetic Variant and Association with Schizophrenia**: The abstract discusses the identification of a missense variant, rs1801311, in the NDUFA6 gene located at the 22q13.2 locus, which has been robustly associated with schizophrenia. This variant disrupts the binding of transcription factors and is likely causal for schizophrenia.

2. **Interaction with NAGA**: Intriguingly, rs1801311 is found to physically interact with NAGA, which encodes the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of glycoproteins and glycolipids in the lysosome, processes that are critical for normal cellular function.

3. **Regulation of NAGA Expression**: The risk allele (G) of rs1801311 is associated with higher expression of NAGA in the human brain. This suggests that the presence of the risk allele leads to increased levels of NAGA, which the study connects to the pathology of schizophrenia.

4. **eQTL and Expression Analysis**: Consistent with the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, NAGA was found to be significantly upregulated in the brains of schizophrenia cases compared to controls. This supports the hypothesis that higher expression of NAGA, influenced by rs1801311, is associated with the disease.

5. **Functional Implications of NAGA**: Further, the study discusses how NAGA regulates important neurodevelopmental processes such as the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. This aligns with many theories of schizophrenia’s etiology, which often involve dysregulation of neurodevelopmental pathways.

6. **Pathways Analysis**: Transcriptome analysis provided additional evidence that NAGA regulates pathways associated with neuronal differentiation, further linking its role to key processes that could influence schizophrenia development.

7. **Validation of the Association**: The association between rs1801311 and schizophrenia was independently confirmed in a large Chinese cohort, reinforcing the robustness of the findings.

**Conclusion**: The abstract supports the statement that mutations in NAGA affect susceptibility to schizophrenia by demonstrating how a specific genetic variant associated with the disease leads to altered expression of NAGA, which in turn appears to play a significant role in brain function and development relevant to schizophrenia. This study highlights the complex interplay between genetic variants and their regulatory effects on gene expression as mechanisms underlying schizophrenia susceptibility."	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed that genetic variants at the 22q13.2 risk locus were robustly associated with schizophrenia. However, the causal variants at this risk locus and their roles in schizophrenia remain elusive. Here we identify the risk missense variant rs1801311 (located in the 1st exon of NDUFA6 gene) as likely causal for schizophrenia at 22q13.2 by disrupting binding of YY1, TAF1, and POLR2A. We systematically elucidated the regulatory mechanisms of rs1801311 and validated the regulatory effect of this missense variant. Intriguingly, rs1801311 physically interacted with NAGA (encodes the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which is mainly involved in regulating metabolisms of glycoproteins and glycolipids in lysosome) and showed the most significant association with NAGA expression in the human brain, with the risk allele (G) associated with higher NAGA expression. Consistent with eQTL analysis, expression analysis showed that NAGA was significantly upregulated in brains of schizophrenia cases compared with controls, further supporting that rs1801311 may confer schizophrenia risk by regulating NAGA expression. Of note, we found that NAGA regulates important neurodevelopmental processes, including proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Transcriptome analysis corroborated that NAGA regulates pathways associated with neuronal differentiation. Finally, we independently confirmed the association between rs1801311 and schizophrenia in a large Chinese cohort. Our study elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the missense schizophrenia risk variant rs1801311 and provides mechanistic links between risk variant and schizophrenia etiology. In addition, this study also revealed the novel role of coding variants in gene regulation and schizophrenia risk, i.e., genetic variant in coding region of a specific gene may confer disease risk through regulating distal genes (act as regulatory variant for distal genes).
56	56	34112868	MADD is a therapeutic target for treatment of Alzheimer's disease	MADD	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that MADD is a therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Interaction and Role of MADD and TNFR1**: The abstract describes the interaction between TNFR1 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1) and MADD (MAPK Activating Death Domain), noting that they mediate downstream signaling pathways that contribute to neuronal cell death, a key pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease. This sets the stage by linking MADD directly to disease mechanisms.

2. **Molecular Docking Study**: The use of molecular docking to explore the interactions between TNFR1 and MADD helps to understand how these proteins contribute to the activation of pathways leading to neuronal cell death. The study identifies specific residues involved in these interactions, highlighting the potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

3. **Significance of Identified Residues**: The identification of Asp400, Arg58, and Arg59 as critical residues in the interaction between TNFR1 and MADD indicates specific sites where therapeutic agents might disrupt these interactions to prevent the activation of harmful signaling pathways.

4. **Molecular Dynamics Simulation**: The stability of the interactions between the death domains (DDs) of TNFR1 and MADD, confirmed through molecular dynamic simulations, suggests that these interactions are viable targets for drug development. Stability in this context implies that the interactions are consistent and significant enough to be effectively targeted by therapeutic agents.

5. **Therapeutic Implications**: The abstract concludes by suggesting that understanding and targeting the interactions between TNFR1 and MADD, particularly through their death domains, could be beneficial in treating Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the MAPK pathway, which is implicated in the disease's pathology.

6. **Novel Pharmacological Targets**: By highlighting the death domains of TNFR1 and MADD as potential novel pharmacological targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment, the abstract supports the idea that targeting MADD could inhibit key pathways involved in neuronal death, offering a new avenue for therapy development.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that MADD, through its interaction with TNFR1 and involvement in critical signaling pathways leading to neuronal cell death, could be a viable therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. The detailed molecular insights into the interactions and pathways provide a basis for the development of interventions aimed at modifying these interactions to treat Alzheimer's disease."	Proteins are tiny players involved in the activation and deactivation of multiple signaling cascades through interactions in cells. The TNFR1 and MADD interact with each other and mediate downstream protein signaling pathways which cause neuronal cell death and Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, a molecular docking approach was employed to explore the interactive behavior of TNFR1 and MADD proteins and their role in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The computational sequential and structural conformational results revealed that Asp400, Arg58, Arg59 were common residues of TNFR1 and MADD which are involved in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Aspartic acid in negatively charged residues is involved in the biosynthesis of protein. However, arginine is a positively charged residue with the potential to interact with oppositely charged amino acids. Furthermore, our molecular dynamic simulation results also ensured the stability of the backbone of TNFR1 and MADD death domains (DDs) in binding interactions. This DDs interaction mediates some conformational changes in TNFR1 which leads to the activation of mediators proteins in the cellular signaling pathways. Taken together, a better understanding of TNFR1 and MADD receptors and their activated signaling cascade may help treat Alzheimer's disease. The death domains of TNFR1 and MADD could be used as a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.
59	59	35880649	Mutations in MFRP are associated with nanophthalmos 	MFRP	nanophthalmos 	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that mutations in MFRP are associated with nanophthalmos. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of MFRP**: The abstract begins by acknowledging the critical role of the Membrane Frizzled-Related Protein (MFRP) in ocular development. It notes that mutations in MFRP are known to cause nanophthalmos and other ocular conditions, establishing the gene’s significance in eye-related disorders.

2. **Genetic Findings in Affected Individuals**: The abstract details the genetic analysis of two affected siblings who were found to have MFRP mutations—specifically variants c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro). These mutations were found ""in trans,"" meaning each sibling inherited a different mutation from each parent. This genetic configuration is crucial for expressing the disease phenotype in autosomal recessive conditions like those typically associated with MFRP mutations.

3. **Clinical Manifestations**: The presence of these mutations correlated with specific clinical findings in the affected siblings, including markedly reduced photopic and scotopic responses on electroretinograms (ERGs) and abnormalities observed in optical coherence tomography. These findings are consistent with the visual impairment symptoms associated with nanophthalmos.

4. **Phenotypic Spectrum**: The abstract discusses the broad clinical spectrum of MFRP mutations, indicating variability in how the mutations manifest, which is typical in genetic disorders depending on other genetic and environmental factors.

5. **Study Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that MFRP-related ocular disease, including nanophthalmos, may be underrecognized due to its variable presentation. The specific mutations identified in the study are directly linked to the nanophthalmos phenotype observed in the patients, affirming the association between MFRP mutations and the disease.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides clear evidence supporting the association between mutations in MFRP and nanophthalmos, based on both genetic findings and clinical manifestations in patients. The detailed description of the mutations and their effects on ocular physiology underlines the critical role of MFRP in the pathogenesis of nanophthalmos, making it a significant focus for diagnosis and potential therapeutic interventions."	Membrane frizzled-related protein (MFRP) plays a critical role in ocular development. <i>MFRP</i> mutations are known to cause nanophthalmos and, in some cases, retinitis pigmentosa, foveoschisis, and/or optic nerve head (ONH) drusen. The broad clinical spectrum of <i>MFRP</i> mutations necessitates further investigation of specific genotype-phenotype relationships. We reviewed ophthalmologic and genetic medical records of two affected siblings and one unaffected sibling. Genetic testing revealed variants <i>MFRP</i> c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and <i>MFRP</i> c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro) in <i>trans</i> in the two affected siblings. In both cases, photopic and scotopic responses were markedly reduced on electroretinogram (ERG), with greater decrease in scotopic function. Optical coherence tomography for both siblings revealed non-cystoid thickening. Blunted foveal reflexes were also observed in both siblings. Notably, foveal avascular zone abnormalities were seen on fundus autofluorescence in only one affected sibling. MFRP-related ocular disease may be underrecognized due to its presentation with high hyperopia and possibly subtle retinal findings. Presence of variants <i>MFRP</i> c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and <i>MFRP</i> c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro) in <i>trans</i> resulted in nanophthalmos and retinitis pigmentosa without associated foveoschisis or ONH drusen in our patients, consistent with the incomplete phenotype previously described in Neri et al. Abnormalities in the foveal avascular zone have been noted in other case studies and were inconsistently associated with the variants described here, representing a potential area for future investigation.
16	16	23200920	Mutations in TLR4 contribute to the risk of tuberculosis	TLR4	Tuberculosis	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in TLR4 contribute to the risk of tuberculosis. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract addresses this topic:

1. **Objective and Background**: The study aims to determine whether polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene affect susceptibility to tuberculosis. TLR4 is recognized as playing an important role in immunity against the tubercle bacillus, which suggests a potential genetic influence on tuberculosis risk. 

2. **Meta-analysis Approach**: The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis, integrating data from previously published studies to provide more reliable estimates regarding the association between TLR4 gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis risk.

3. **Methods**: They systematically searched the literature and included six case-control studies in their meta-analysis, involving a total of 1587 controls and 2110 patients. This approach enhances the reliability of the findings due to the systematic method and the relatively large sample size.

4. **Results**: The results showed no significant association between two specific polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) and the risk of developing tuberculosis. Various genetic models were analyzed (codominant, dominant, recessive, and allele models), and none showed statistically significant associations, as indicated by the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the meta-analysis, the study concludes that these TLR4 gene polymorphisms do not contribute to susceptibility to tuberculosis. This conclusion is supported by the statistical analysis across different genetic models, reinforcing the reliability of the finding.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence against the statement that mutations in TLR4 contribute to the risk of tuberculosis, clearly stating that the examined TLR4 polymorphisms do not affect the susceptibility to this disease according to the analyzed data."	Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a vital role in immunity to tubercle bacillus and its gene polymorphisms are supposed to affect tuberculosis susceptibility in some rather than all studies. Then, we integrated published data and performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to get more reliable estimations for the strength of associations between TLR4 gene polymorphisms and the risk of tuberculosis. We systematically searched the electronic PubMed database for research articles about TLR4 gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis up to February 2012. Revman 5.0 software was adopted to conduct the meta-analysis. Crude odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by either fixed-effects model or random-effects model. Finally, six case-control studies were identified, involving 1587 controls and 2110 patients. Overall, no significant associations were found between TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism and tuberculosis in the codominant models (GG vs AA: OR=1.56, 95% CI=0.76-3.21, P=0.23; GA vs AA: OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.84-1.23, P=0.89), the dominant model (GG+GA vs AA: OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.80-1.35, P=0.75), the recessive model (GG vs GA+AA: OR=1.55, 95% CI=0.75-3.19, P=0.24) and the allele model (G vs A: OR=1.06, 95% CI=0.81-1.40, P=0.66). Similarly, no significant associations between TLR4 gene Thr399Ile and tuberculosis were observed (all P>0.05). The present meta-analysis suggests that TLR4 gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms are not associated with the susceptibility of tuberculosis.
71	71	27616475	Variations in NAT1 increase the risk of gastroschisis 	NAT1	gastroschisis 	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that variations in NAT1 increase the risk of gastroschisis. Instead, it suggests the opposite:

1. **Results for NAT1**: The study found a significant association between a variant of the NAT1 gene and a decreased risk of gastroschisis. The odds ratio (ORv) for this association is 0.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9). This odds ratio below 1 indicates a protective effect, meaning that the presence of this NAT1 variant actually reduces the risk of gastroschisis, rather than increases it.

2. **Study Design and Analysis**: This was a well-designed population-based case-control study that included a comprehensive analysis of 75 genetic variants in 20 genes related to the risk of gastroschisis, considering environmental factors such as smoking and vitamin use. The use of logistic regression to estimate risks further strengthens the reliability of the findings.

3. **Interpretation of Results**: The finding that the NAT1 variant is associated with a decreased risk of gastroschisis contradicts the statement that NAT1 variations increase the risk. It is crucial to note that the statistical significance (P = 0.009) supports a strong association of this variant with a protective effect against gastroschisis.

4. **Overall Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that while several genes showed a significant correlation with gastroschisis risk, NAT1 specifically showed an association with a reduced risk. This result indicates that NAT1, at least in the context of this study's population and genetic variants analyzed, is not a risk factor for increasing gastroschisis but rather appears to have a protective role.

In summary, the evidence from this abstract contradicts the claim that variations in NAT1 increase the risk of gastroschisis. Instead, it supports that certain variants of NAT1 may decrease the risk of developing this condition."	In a population-based case-control study in California of 228 infants, we investigated 75 genetic variants in 20 genes and risk of gastroschisis with regard to maternal age, race/ethnicity, vitamin use, and smoking exposure. We hypothesized that genes related to vascular compromise may interact with environmental factors to affect the risk of gastroschisis. Haplotypes were constructed for 75 gene variants using the HaploView program. Risk for gastroschisis associated with each gene variant was calculated for both the homozygotes and the heterozygotes, with the homozygous wildtypes as the referent. Risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by logistic regression. We found 11 gene variants with increased risk and four variants with decreased risk of gastroschisis for heterozygous (OR<sub>h</sub> ) or homozygous variants (OR<sub>v</sub> ) genotypes. These included NOS3 (rs1036145) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.7); NOS3 (rs10277237) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3-6.0); ADD1 (rs12503220) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6-5.4), GNB3 (rs5443) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.5), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9); ICAM1 (rs281428) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 6.9 (95% CI: 2.1-22.9), ICAM1 (rs3093030) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.2-5.6); ICAM4 (rs281438) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 4.9 (95% CI: 1.4-16.6), ICAM5 (rs281417) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.1), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 4.8 (95% CI: 1.7-13.6); ICAM5 (rs281440) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 23.7 (95% CI: 5.5-102.5), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 20.6 (95% CI: 3.4-124.3); ICAM5 (rs2075741) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.2 (95% CI: 1.1-4.4); NAT1 OR<sub>v</sub>  = 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-0.9). There were additional associations between several gene variants and gastroschisis among women aged 20-24 and among mothers with and without vitamin use. NOS3, ADD1, ICAM1, ICAM4, and ICAM5 warrant further investigation in additional populations and with the interaction of additional environmental exposures. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
48	48	10510981	A mutation in JRK can cause childhood absence epilepsy	JRK	Childhood absence epilepsy	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in JRK can cause childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Instead, it provides evidence that effectively rules out JRK as the gene responsible for ECA1, a specific locus associated with CAE. Here's how the abstract arrives at this conclusion:

1. **Background and Hypothesis**: The abstract starts by acknowledging the genetic heterogeneity of CAE and identifies a specific genetic locus, ECA1 on chromosome 8q24, previously linked to the condition. The JRK/JH8 gene, a human homologue of the mouse jerky gene associated with epilepsy, is located on this chromosome and was considered a candidate for being the CAE gene due to its phenotypic and locational attributes.

2. **Genetic Analysis**: To test the hypothesis that JRK/JH8 might be responsible for ECA1, mutational analysis was performed on the coding region of JRK/JH8 in families with CAE mapped to 8q24. The methods used included heteroduplex and direct sequencing, which are suitable for identifying nucleotide changes that could be linked to the disease.

3. **Results of the Mutational Analysis**: The analysis identified seven nucleotide changes in the JRK/JH8 gene, including two that led to amino acid substitutions. However, crucially, these changes did not co-segregate with the disease phenotype within the families studied. This means that the presence of these mutations did not consistently appear in all individuals affected by CAE, weakening the case for JRK/JH8 as the causal gene.

4. **Physical Mapping**: Further undermining the hypothesis, the physical mapping of the JRK/JH8 gene indicated that it is located more than 4 megabases away from the previously identified ECA1 locus. This significant distance makes it unlikely that mutations in JRK/JH8 are responsible for the CAE cases linked to the ECA1 locus.

5. **Conclusion of the Study**: The study concludes that JRK/JH8 is not the gene responsible for ECA1, based on the negative results from the mutation analyses and the gene's physical location relative to the ECA1 locus.

**Conclusion**: The evidence provided in the abstract strongly suggests that JRK/JH8 does not cause CAE, specifically in the context of the ECA1 locus. This conclusion is based on the lack of co-segregation of identified mutations with the disease phenotype and the geographic discrepancy between the gene's location and the ECA1 locus.

This conclusion is based on the lack of co-segregation of identified mutations with the disease phenotype and the geographic discrepancy between the gene's location and the ECA1 locus. Thus, the statement that a mutation in JRK can cause childhood absence epilepsy is not supported by the findings presented in this abstract."	Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), one of the most common epilepsies in children, is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. One of the genes responsible for human CAE associated with tonic-clonic seizures has been mapped to chromosome band 8q24 by genetic linkage analysis and is termed ECA1. Recently, we isolated and mapped the JRK/JH8 gene, a human homologue of the mouse epilepsy gene, jerky, on 8q24. The epilepsy phenotype of the mice with inactivated jerky gene as well as its chromosomal localization proposed JRK/JH8 as a prominent candidate for the CAE gene. To confirm whether the JRK/JH8 gene is responsible for ECA1, we performed mutational analyses in the coding region of JRK/JH8 in two CAE families mapped on 8q24, using heteroduplex and direct sequencing methods. We identified seven nucleotide changes, two of which lead to amino acid substitutions. However, these changes did not co-segregate with the disease phenotype. In addition, we redefined the location of JRK/JH8 to be more than 4 Mb distant from D8S502 and ECA1. Thus, negative results of mutation analyses and detailed physical mapping exclude JRK/JH8 as the ECA1 gene.
73	73	29582521	Mutations is OAS3 are correlated with Hepatitiis B	OAS3	Hepatitis B	1	"The biomedical abstract indeed supports the statement that mutations in OAS3 are correlated with hepatitis B, specifically the unusual clinical phenomenon of the coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) in patients. Here's how the abstract substantiates this correlation:

1. **Study Design and Objectives**: The study conducted a detailed genetic analysis in two stages within the Chinese Han population to explore the host genetic factors linked to the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs, a phenomenon observed in some hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

2. **Genetic Analysis**: Initially, whole exome sequencing was performed, followed by a specific focus on the OAS3 gene. This gene was chosen possibly due to its known role in immune response to viral infections.

3. **Findings in OAS3**: The first stage of the study did not find genome-wide significant loci but highlighted that rare variants in the OAS3 gene were associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs. The gene-based burden analysis showed a significant association (P-value = 4.127e-06), suggesting that variants in OAS3 contribute to this clinical presentation.

4. **Validation and Further Analysis**: In the second stage, direct sequencing of OAS3 in additional cohorts found rare coding sequence mutations significantly more frequent in cases than in controls (P-value = 7.299e-09, OR = 17.27). This strong association and the high odds ratio further emphasize the role of OAS3 mutations in this specific phenotype of hepatitis B.

5. **Clinical and Biological Implications**: The identification of rare mutations in OAS3 among individuals exhibiting both HBsAg and anti-HBs implies a potential genetic predisposition facilitated by these mutations that affect the immune response to HBV, possibly influencing the virus's detection and the immune system's response.

6. **Conclusion**: The study conclusively suggests that protein-coding rare variations in OAS3 are associated with the simultaneous presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in chronic HBV infection among the Chinese Han population. This finding not only supports the correlation between OAS3 mutations and hepatitis B but also underscores the genetic complexity influencing the clinical course of HBV infection.

Thus, the abstract provides robust evidence that mutations in the OAS3 gene are linked to a specific and rare manifestation of hepatitis B, highlighting the gene's role in the pathophysiology of the disease."	The underlying mechanism of coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (anti-HBs) is still controversial. To identify the host genetic factors related to this unusual clinical phenomenon, a two-stage study was conducted in the Chinese Han population. In the first stage, we performed a case-control (1:1) age- and gender-matched study of 101 cases with concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs and 102 controls with negative HBsAg and positive anti-HBs using whole exome sequencing. In the second validation stage, we directly sequence the 16 exons on the OAS3 gene in two dependent cohorts of 48 cases and 200 controls. Although, in the first stage, a genome-wide association study of 58,563 polymorphism variants in 101 cases and 102 controls found no significant loci (P-value ≤ .05/58563), and neither locus achieved a conservative genome-wide significance threshold (P-value ≤ 5e-08), gene-based burden analysis showed that OAS3 gene rare variants were associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs. (P-value = 4.127e-06 ≤ 0.05/6994). A total of 16 rare variants were screened out from 21 cases and 3 controls. In the second validation stage, one case with a stop-gained rare variant was identified. Fisher's exact test of all 149 cases and 302 controls showed that the rare coding sequence mutations were more frequent in cases vs controls (P-value = 7.299e-09, OR = 17.27, 95% CI [5.01-58.72]). Protein-coding rare variations on the OAS3 gene are associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in patients with chronic HBV infection in Chinese Han population.
35	35	36007472	GAB2 expression can contribute to osteoarthritis	GAB2	Osteoarthritis	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that GAB2 expression can contribute to osteoarthritis (OA). Here is a detailed breakdown of how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Role of GAB2 in Signaling Pathways**: The abstract states that GAB2 (Grb2-associated-Binding protein-2) is involved in various signaling pathways, including inflammatory signaling pathways, which are crucial in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including osteoarthritis. GAB2's role in these pathways suggests it could influence processes like inflammation that are central to OA development.

2. **GAB2 Expression in OA Models**: It is noted that GAB2 expression was elevated in chondrocytes in both in vivo and in vitro models of osteoarthritis. This increase in GAB2 expression in OA models directly correlates its expression with the disease state, suggesting a potential contributory role in OA pathogenesis.

3. **Impact of GAB2 Inhibition on OA Markers**: The study found that inhibition of GAB2 (using siRNA) resulted in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3, MMP13) and inflammatory enzymes (iNOS, COX2) which are known to be involved in cartilage breakdown and inflammation in OA. Additionally, inhibition increased the expression of markers associated with cartilage synthesis and autophagy (COL2, SOX9, ATG7, Beclin-1, LC3II/LC3I). These changes are beneficial in the context of OA, as they suggest a shift towards cartilage repair and reduced degradation.

4. **Effect on Inflammatory Signaling Pathways**: Further demonstrating GAB2's role, its inhibition also reduced the activity of key inflammatory and stress-related signaling pathways (MAPK and NF-κB) triggered by IL-1β, a cytokine known to be pivotal in OA pathogenesis. This indicates that GAB2 facilitates inflammatory responses in OA.

5. **In Vivo Evidence**: The in vivo study showed that reduced GAB2 expression delayed cartilage destruction in a mouse model of osteoarthritis induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus. This provides practical evidence that GAB2 not only is associated with OA but actively contributes to its progression.

6. **Therapeutic Potential of Targeting GAB2**: The conclusion that GAB2 is a potential therapeutic target for OA underscores its role in the disease. By identifying GAB2 as a target, the study implies that its expression and activity are sufficiently linked to OA outcomes to warrant intervention.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract supports the statement that GAB2 expression can contribute to osteoarthritis by detailing how GAB2 is involved in key processes related to OA pathogenesis, such as inflammatory responses and cartilage degradation, and by demonstrating that modulation of GAB2 expression can alter the course of the disease in experimental models. This makes GAB2 not only a marker of OA progression but also a potential contributor to its development and severity."	Osteoarthritis is a chronic age-related degenerative disease associated with varying degrees of pain and joint mobility disorders. Grb2-associated-Binding protein-2 (GAB2) is an intermediate molecule that plays a role downstream in a variety of signaling pathways, such as inflammatory signaling pathways. The role of GAB2 in the pathogenesis of OA has not been fully studied. In this study, we found that GAB2 expression was elevated in chondrocytes after constructing in vivo and in vitro models of OA. Inhibition of GAB2 by siRNA decreased the expression of MMP3, MMP13, iNOS, COX2, p62, and increased the expression of COL2, SOX9, ATG7, Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I. Furthermore, inhibition of GAB2 expression inhibited interleukin-1β (IL-1β) -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In vivo studies, we found that reduced GAB2 expression effectively delayed cartilage destruction in a mouse model of OA induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that GAB2 is a potential therapeutic target for OA.
11	11	25387188	Penicillin is proven to be an effective treatment for syphillis	Penicillin	Syphillis	1	"The abstract strongly supports the statement that penicillin is proven to be an effective treatment for syphilis. Here’s how the abstract underlines this:

1. **Extensive Review**: The abstract describes a comprehensive review of the literature from 1965 until July 2014, including randomized trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies, which provides a robust evidence base for evaluating treatment regimens for syphilis.

2. **Specific Findings on Penicillin**: It specifically highlights that data from studies involving 11,102 patients reviewed penicillin and non-penicillin regimens. For early syphilis, it mentions the effectiveness of a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G, with treatment success rates reported between 90% to 100%.

3. **Treatment Success and Serological Response**: The abstract discusses the high success rates of penicillin treatment and the expected serological response, noting that nontreponemal serologic titers should decline following treatment, although some patients may remain seropositive in what is known as the ""serofast state."" This indicates that while the serological response can be complex, the initial effectiveness of penicillin is well-documented.

4. **Considerations for Special Populations**: While stating that the evidence is limited for specific populations like HIV-infected individuals and pregnant women, the abstract still supports penicillin as the first-line therapy, indicating its broad applicability and the trust placed in it as an effective treatment across different patient groups.

5. **Conclusion and Relevance**: The conclusion that penicillin G remains the mainstay of syphilis treatment emphasizes its established role despite modest clinical trial data. This statement encapsulates the consensus in the medical community about penicillin’s efficacy based on longstanding use and supportive evidence from numerous studies.

In summary, the abstract not only supports the statement that penicillin is an effective treatment for syphilis but also details its use, effectiveness, and the nature of evidence that backs its continued use as the primary treatment option for this infection."	"The incidence of syphilis in the United States is increasing; it is estimated that more than 55,000 new infections will occur in 2014. Treatment regimens are controversial, especially in specific populations, and assessing treatment response based on serology remains a challenge. To review evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens, implications of the ""serofast state,"" and treatment of specific populations including those with neurosyphilis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pregnant women. We searched MEDLINE for English-language human treatment studies dating from January 1965 until July 2014. The American Heart Association classification system was used to rate quality of evidence. We included 102 articles in our review, consisting of randomized trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies. Case reports and small series were excluded unless they were the only studies providing evidence for a specific treatment strategy. We included 11 randomized trials. Evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens was reviewed from studies involving 11,102 patients. Data on the treatment of early syphilis support the use of a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million U of benzathine penicillin G, with studies reporting 90% to 100% treatment success rates. The value of multiple-dose treatment of early syphilis is uncertain, especially in HIV-infected individuals. Less evidence is available regarding therapy for late and late latent syphilis. Following treatment, nontreponemal serologic titers should decline in a stable pattern, but a significant proportion of patients may remain seropositive (the ""serofast state""). Serologic response to treatment should be evident by 6 months in early syphilis but is generally slower (12-24 months) for latent syphilis. Evidence defining treatment for HIV-infected persons and for pregnant women is limited, but available data support penicillin as first-line therapy. The mainstay of syphilis treatment is parenteral penicillin G despite the relatively modest clinical trial data that support its use."
75	75	36127160	OAS3 activity is associated with severe COVID-19	OAS3	COVID-19	1	"The biomedical abstract indeed supports the statement that OAS3 activity is associated with severe COVID-19. Here's how the abstract contributes to this assertion:

1. **Identification of OAS3**: The study identifies 2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 3 (OAS3) as one of the top five most associated protein-coding genes with severe COVID-19 through a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis. This analysis explores the causal association between gene expression and severe COVID-19 outcomes using eQTL data from multiple tissues.

2. **Genetic Association**: OAS3 was pinpointed as significantly associated with severe COVID-19 phenotypes. This suggests a potential causal role for OAS3 in the severity of the disease, likely due to its involvement in immune response pathways, particularly those related to interferon signaling.

3. **Biological Relevance**: OAS3 is known for its role in the immune response, especially in the synthesis of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates that activate RNase L, leading to the degradation of viral RNA. Its association with severe COVID-19 aligns with the understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology, where an impaired or overactive immune response can exacerbate disease severity.

4. **Context of Study**: The study used a robust genetic approach (Mendelian randomization) that reduces the likelihood of confounding factors and biases typically present in observational studies. This strengthens the claim that the association between OAS3 and severe COVID-19 could be causal rather than merely correlational.

5. **Enrichment in Biological Processes**: The significant genes, including OAS3, were enriched in biological processes related to type I interferons and other immune response pathways critical in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19.

**Conclusion**:
The abstract strongly supports the statement that OAS3 activity is associated with severe COVID-19, suggesting that genetic variations affecting OAS3 expression or function might influence the severity of the disease. This highlights the importance of OAS3 in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and potentially offers a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at moderating the immune response in severe COVID-19 cases."	Severe COVID-19 has a poor prognosis, while the genetic mechanism underlying severe COVID-19 remains largely unknown. We aimed to identify genes that are potentially causally associated with severe COVID-19. We conducted a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from 49 different tissues as the exposure and three COVID-19-phenotypes (very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 [severe COVID-19], hospitalized COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infection) as the outcomes. SMR using multiple SNPs was used as a sensitivity analysis to reduce false positive rate. Multiple testing was corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) q-value. We identified 309 significant gene-trait associations (FDR q value < 0.05) across 46 tissues for severe COVID-19, which mapped to 64 genes, of which 38 are novel. The top five most associated protein-coding genes were Interferon Alpha and Beta Receptor Subunit 2 (IFNAR2), 2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 3 (OAS3), mucin 1 (MUC1), Interleukin 10 Receptor Subunit Beta (IL10RB), and Napsin A Aspartic Peptidase (NAPSA). The potential causal genes were enriched in biological processes related to type I interferons, interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 production, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 production. In addition, we further identified 23 genes and 5 biological processes which are unique to hospitalized COVID-19, as well as 13 genes that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified several genes that are potentially causally associated with severe COVID-19. These findings improve our limited understanding of the mechanism of COVID-19 and shed light on the development of therapeutic agents for treating severe COVID-19.
91	91	26399695	VAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease	VAMP1	Alzheimers	1	"This biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that VAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Here's a breakdown of how it supports this statement:

1. **Genetic Association**: The study identifies five polymorphisms in the VAMP1 gene, which encodes a member of the SNARE complex crucial for neuronal Aβ release, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. This establishes a direct genetic link to potential alterations in Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.

2. **Expression and Functional Impact**: It demonstrates that these polymorphisms can lead to bidirectional changes in VAMP1 expression in the cerebellum, impacting neuronal Aβ exocytosis. Specifically, knockdown experiments showing a significant reduction in Aβ exocytosis with altered VAMP1 expression underline the functional importance of these polymorphisms.

3. **Epidemiological Evidence**: A case-control association study involving a large sample (4,667 Alzheimer's disease patients and 6,175 controls) shows that polymorphisms associated with increased VAMP1 expression correlate with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, a polymorphism linked to decreased expression shows a modest protective effect.

4. **Statistical Significance**: The associations between VAMP1 expression levels and Alzheimer's disease risk are statistically significant, providing strong epidemiological evidence that VAMP1 polymorphisms contribute to the disease's pathology.

5. **Mechanistic Insight**: The study connects the genetic variations in VAMP1 with functional outcomes (neuronal Aβ exocytosis) that are central to the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that VAMP1 could influence disease onset and progression through its role in Aβ dynamics.

In conclusion, the abstract supports the statement by providing both genetic and functional evidence that VAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, offering insights into the molecular mechanisms that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention."	Following publication of this work, we noticed that we inadvertently failed to include Dr Ferenc Deák in the author list. The author list has now been corrected and the amended authors' contributions section has been modified accordingly below.
1	1	22664493	A mutation in CFTR contributes to Asthma	CFTR	Asthma	0	"The abstract does not definitively support the statement that a mutation in the CFTR gene contributes to asthma, but it does indicate a potential connection that merits further investigation. Here's why:

1. **Hypothesis Mentioned**: The abstract mentions a hypothesis that individuals heterozygous for CFTR gene mutations (i.e., having one normal copy and one mutated copy of the CFTR gene) may develop obstructive pulmonary diseases like asthma. This suggests a possible link between CFTR mutations and asthma, but it is presented as a hypothesis rather than a confirmed finding.

2. **Phenotypic Heterogeneity**: The abstract highlights that there is great heterogeneity in the severity and presentation of CF lung disease, which could be influenced by genetic or environmental factors. This variability suggests that the effect of CFTR mutations could extend beyond cystic fibrosis to other pulmonary conditions like asthma, although this is not conclusively proven.

3. **Modifier Genes**: It is mentioned that several modifier genes could interact with the CFTR pathway and influence the severity of disease. This introduces the possibility that CFTR mutations, in conjunction with other genetic factors, could potentially impact asthma development or severity.

4. **Unclear Association**: The abstract explicitly states that the association between CFTR gene mutations and asthma is still unclear, with studies showing varied results—some indicate a positive or protective association, while others show no association at all. This indicates that the evidence is not yet strong or consistent enough to definitively link CFTR mutations to asthma.

5. **Call for More Research**: The abstract concludes that more studies with large sample sizes and detailed phenotyping are needed to define the potential role of CFTR in asthma pathogenesis. This underscores the current lack of definitive evidence and the need for further research to explore this potential connection.

In summary, while the abstract acknowledges a hypothesized link between CFTR mutations and asthma, it clearly states that the evidence is inconclusive at this time and more research is required to establish any definitive connection."	Mutation on both the copies of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene results in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a recessively transmitted genetic disorder. It is hypothesized that individuals heterozygous for CFTR gene mutation may develop obstructive pulmonary diseases like asthma. There is great heterogeneity in the phenotypic presentation and severity of CF lung disease. This could be due to genetic or environmental factors. Several modifier genes have been identified which may directly or indirectly interact with CFTR pathway and affect the severity of disease. This review article discusses the information related to the association of CFTR gene mutation with asthma. Association between CFTR gene mutation and asthma is still unclear. Report ranges from studies showing positive or protective association to those showing no association. Therefore, studies with sufficiently large sample size and detailed phenotype are required to define the potential contribution of CFTR in the pathogenesis of asthma.
3	3	29746266	Ibalizumab is effective in treating HIV-1	Ibalizumab	HIV-1	1	"The abstract clearly supports the statement that ""Ibalizumab is effective in treating HIV-1."" Here's a breakdown of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Purpose and Background**: The abstract sets the context by discussing the need for new antiretroviral agents for patients with multi-class resistant HIV-1. Ibalizumab is introduced as a new type of therapeutic agent—a parenteral CD4 postattachment inhibitor.

2. **Clinical Trial Results**: Key evidence for ibalizumab's effectiveness is provided by the results of a phase III clinical trial. It reports that ibalizumab, when administered intravenously, resulted in significant declines in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Specifically, there was a reduction of more than 0.5 log in 83% of participants at one week. Furthermore, after adding an optimized background antiretroviral regimen, the virus was suppressed to less than 50 copies/ml in 43% of participants at 24 weeks. This demonstrates a clear and effective viral load reduction when using ibalizumab in combination with other antiretrovirals.

3. **Safety Profile**: The abstract notes that adverse effects were uncommon and generally low grade, which supports the assertion of efficacy by indicating that not only does ibalizumab work well, but it also does so with a manageable safety profile.

4. **Regulatory Approval**: The mention of ibalizumab’s approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the trade name Trogarzo as of March 16, 2018, further validates its effectiveness and safety, as FDA approval involves a rigorous review of data from clinical trials to ensure that a drug is effective and safe for its intended use.

5. **Ongoing Development**: The abstract concludes with information about ongoing efforts to enhance ibalizumab, such as prolonging its clearance and broadening its activity. This points to its established role and continued potential in HIV-1 treatment strategies.

In summary, the abstract provides substantial evidence of ibalizumab's efficacy in treating HIV-1, particularly in challenging cases of multidrug-resistant virus, thereby strongly supporting the statement about its effectiveness."	Antiretroviral options for patients infected with multiclass resistant HIV-1 warrant the development of new agents with unique mechanisms of action and modes of delivery. Here we review one such agent, ibalizumab, a parenteral CD4 postattachment inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy as part of combination antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV-1. In a phase III clinical trial in HIV-infected participants with multiclass antiretroviral drug resistance, the intravenous administration of ibalizumab led to declines in plasma HIV-1 RNA more than 0.5 log in 83% of participants at 1 week. An optimized background antiretroviral regimen was then added, and plasma HIV-1 RNA became less than 50 copies/ml in 43% of participants at 24 weeks. Adverse effects of ibalizumab were uncommon and generally low grade. Ibalizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on March 16, 2018, under the trade name Trogarzo. Ibalizumab has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Its primary use will be in the setting of multidrug resistant virus as part of combination antiretroviral therapy. Further enhancements of ibalizumab to prolong its clearance and broaden its activity are in development.
20	20	30804141	Medication-related jaw osteonecrosis can be caused  by a mutation in ACE	Medication-related jaw osteonecrosis	ACE	0	"The biomedical abstract does not provide strong support for the statement that medication-related jaw osteonecrosis (MRONJ) can be directly caused by a mutation in the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) gene. Instead, the abstract describes a possible association between a genetic predisposition to hypertension (via the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene) and an increased risk of developing MRONJ in two patients. Here's a breakdown of how the abstract relates to the statement:

1. **Patient Descriptions and Treatments**: The abstract describes two patients who developed MRONJ after dental extractions and following treatment with medications known to be associated with MRONJ (zolendronate and denosumab). Both patients also had hypertension and were found to have variants of the ACE gene associated with high blood pressure.

2. **ACE Gene Variant and Hypertension**: Both patients had the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene—one homozygously and the other heterozygously. This variant is known to predispose individuals to hypertension, which is a significant point since both patients presented with high blood pressure.

3. **Hypothesis on Genetic Predisposition and MRONJ**: The abstract suggests that there may be a link between the genetic predisposition to hypertension (due to the ACE gene variant) and an increased risk of MRONJ. This hypothesis is speculative and based on only two cases. The authors themselves note that this is the first report of such an association, indicating that the evidence is preliminary.

4. **Causality vs. Association**: The abstract does not establish a direct causal relationship between the ACE gene mutation and MRONJ. Rather, it posits that the genetic predisposition to hypertension might increase the risk for MRONJ. This is an important distinction because while hypertension may be a risk factor for MRONJ, it does not necessarily imply that the ACE mutation itself causes MRONJ directly.

5. **Lack of Broader Evidence**: Given that the report is based on only two patients and is described as the first of its kind, there is insufficient evidence to broadly generalize that mutations in the ACE gene are a direct cause of MRONJ. More comprehensive studies would be needed to establish a direct link and to understand the mechanisms involved.

In summary, while the abstract suggests an interesting potential link between hypertension predisposition due to ACE gene variants and MRONJ, it does not directly support the statement that mutations in the ACE gene can cause MRONJ. Instead, it opens up an area for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential relationships between hypertension and MRONJ."	The association of the high blood pressure D variant of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene with medication-related jaw osteonecrosis (MRONJ) is described in two Greek patients. The first patient, a 73-year-old man, took zolendronate, 4 mg/100 ml IV once per month for two years for prostate cancer and bone metastases. Three months after drug discontinuation, extraction of the first premolar was performed. After the intervention, he suffered from osteonecrosis of the mandible. He presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that he was homozygous for the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene. The second patient, a 65 years old woman, took denosumab, 120 mg subcutaneously once per month for 6 months for possible bone metastases from breast cancer. Three months after extraction of the first molar, she suffered from MRONJ. He also presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that she had the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene in a heterozygous state, which moderately predisposes to hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that genetic predisposition to hypertension may increase risk for MRONJ.
90	90	36537591	UBA1 variations are associated with VEXAS syndrome	UBA1	VEXAS syndrome	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that variations in the UBA1 gene are associated with VEXAS syndrome. Here are the key aspects of the abstract that support this connection:

1. **Definition and Cause**: The abstract begins by defining VEXAS syndrome as a late-onset, acquired autoinflammatory disorder directly caused by mutations in the UBA1 gene. This establishes a clear link between UBA1 gene mutations and the onset of VEXAS syndrome.

2. **Disease Description**: It describes VEXAS syndrome as a hematoinflammatory disorder, which is a new disease category characterized by somatic mutations that are restricted to blood cells but cause systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement. This description emphasizes the systemic impact of the UBA1 mutations.

3. **Genetic Focus**: The review focuses on the genetic causes and immunopathology of VEXAS syndrome, highlighting the central role of UBA1 mutations in the disease's pathogenesis and clinical presentation.

4. **Clinical Relevance**: The abstract mentions the significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy associated with VEXAS syndrome, underscoring the clinical importance of understanding and diagnosing the UBA1 mutations correctly.

5. **Research and Diagnostic Criteria**: It points out the need for consensus diagnostic criteria to define VEXAS and its related disorders, indicating ongoing research and the evolving understanding of how UBA1 variations manifest in the disease.

6. **Future Directions**: The mention of investigating VEXAS-like cases without UBA1 mutations suggests that while UBA1 is crucial, there might be other genetic factors involved, which requires further research. This highlights the complexity and variability of the genetic underpinnings in syndromes like VEXAS.

In conclusion, the abstract supports the statement that UBA1 variations are associated with VEXAS syndrome by describing the gene's central role in the disease's definition, its pathogenic mechanism, and the clinical impact of its mutations."	VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a recently described, late-onset, acquired autoinflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the <i>UBA1</i> gene. The various clinical manifestations of VEXAS broadly divided into inflammatory or haematological. VEXAS defines a new disease category - the hematoinflammatory disorders triggered by somatic mutations restricted to blood but causing systemic inflammation with multi-organ involvement and associated with aberrant bone marrow status. VEXAS causes significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, but the optimum standard of care remains undefined. This review describes the discovery of VEXAS, relevant genetic causes and immunopathology of the disease. A detailed account of its various clinical manifestations and disease mimics is provided. Current treatment and management options are discussed. New rare variants in <i>UBA1</i> and VEXAS-like <i>UBA1</i> negative cases are reported. Consensus diagnostic criteria might be required to define VEXAS and its related disorders. Investigation of sporadic, VEXAS-like cases will require the application of deep sequencing using DNA obtained from various cellular or tissue locations. Prospective studies are needed to define the optimal supportive and treatment options for patients with varying disease severity and prognosis. VEXAS-specific hematopoietic stem cell transplant selection criteria also require development.
36	36	35941362	Expression of ID1 has no correlation with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	ID1	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that the expression of ID1 has no correlation with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In fact, it provides strong evidence to the contrary, indicating that ID1 expression is significantly correlated with PDAC development and progression. Here's how the abstract provides this evidence:

1. **ID1 Expression Levels and PDAC Development**: The abstract reports that ID1 transcription levels were elevated specifically in association with PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. This direct association between increased ID1 expression and PDAC development suggests a significant correlation.

2. **Correlation with PDAC Malignancy**: Through pseudotime trajectory analysis, the study found that ID1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. This analysis method tracks changes in gene expression over time or developmental stages within a disease process, indicating that as PDAC becomes more malignant, ID1 expression increases.

3. **Comparative Analysis in Human Cells**: The gene expression patterns were analyzed by comparing scRNA-seq data from human PDAC tissues and normal pancreas tissues. The results showed dramatically increased ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells compared to normal epithelial cells, reinforcing the correlation of ID1 expression with PDAC in humans as well.

4. **Functional Impact of ID1 Deficiency**: Experimentally, ID1 deficiency in vitro led to a significant reduction in invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. This finding suggests that ID1 not only is associated with PDAC but also plays a functional role in enhancing the aggressive traits of the cancer.

5. **Regulation by EIF2 Signaling**: The study further identified EIF2 signaling as a core pathway regulating PDAC development, with blocking this pathway leading to decreased ID1 expression and attenuation of tumor-formation phenotypes. This indicates that ID1 is an integral part of the signaling mechanisms driving PDAC progression.

6. **Implications for Treatment**: The conclusion that ID1 acts as a potential malignant biomarker for PDAC and targeting it could be a promising strategy underscores the importance of ID1 in PDAC pathology. This suggests therapeutic potential in modulating ID1 expression or function to treat PDAC.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides compelling evidence that ID1 expression is significantly correlated with the development, progression, and malignancy of PDAC, contradicting the statement that there is no correlation between ID1 expression and PDAC. Instead, ID1 appears to be a critical determinant of PDAC pathology and a potential target for therapeutic intervention."	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease that has an increasing death rate but no effective treatment to now. Although biological and immunological hallmarks of PDAC have been frequently reported recently, early detection and the particularly aggressive biological features are the major challenges remaining unclear. In the current study, we retrieved multiple scRNA-seq datasets and illustrated the genetic programs of PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. Notably, the transcription levels of Id1 were elevated specifically along with the PDAC development. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that Id1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. The gene expression patterns of human PDAC cells were determined by the comparative analysis of the scRNA-seq data on human PDAC and normal pancreas tissues. ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells were dramatically increased compared to normal epithelial cells. ID1 deficiency in vitro significantly blunt the invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. IPA analysis on the differentially expressed genes suggested that EIF2 signaling was the core pathway regulating the development of PDAC. Blocking EFI2 signaling remarkably decreased the expression of ID1 and attenuated the tumor-formation related phenotypes. These observations confirmed that ID1 was regulated by EIF2 signaling and was the critical determinator of PDAC development and progression. This study suggests that ID1 is a potential malignant biomarker of PDAC in both mouse models and human and detecting and targeting ID1 may be a promising strategy to treat or even rescue PDAC.
97	97	38310198	ACP2 expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease	ACP2	Parkinson's Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract provided supports the statement that ACP2 (acid phosphatase 2, lysosomal) expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Here's how the abstract aligns with this statement:

1. **Association with PD**: The study identified ACP2 as one of two critical feature genes through machine learning analysis of RNA-seq data from the substantia nigra of PD patients compared to normal subjects. This suggests a specific role for ACP2 in PD pathogenesis.

2. **Disease Severity Correlation**: ACP2 was found in a molecular classification cluster that had a higher disease severity, implying that its expression levels or patterns might correlate with more severe forms of PD.

3. **Model Validation and Immune Infiltration**: The PD risk prediction model constructed using ACP2 showed robust confidence in predicting PD risk, validated through both machine learning methodologies and biological function analysis in a PD rat model. Additionally, significant immune infiltration correlations with ACP2 underscore its role in neuroinflammatory processes often observed in PD.

4. **Broader Biological Implications**: Beyond PD, ACP2 was analyzed for its roles in various cancers, indicating its involvement in broad biological processes and disease mechanisms, which could include those shared with PD such as cellular stress responses and immune system interactions.

5. **Therapeutic Potential**: The abstract suggests that ACP2 could be a potential therapeutic target in PD, given its association with disease severity and progression, as well as its role in immune-related pathways.

Overall, the abstract supports the claim that ACP2 expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease by detailing its significant role in disease-specific expression patterns, correlations with disease severity, involvement in immune processes, and potential as a therapeutic target. This broadens the understanding of lysosomal function in neurodegenerative diseases and positions ACP2 as a notable gene of interest in both research and clinical contexts for PD."	The pivotal role of lysosomal function in preserving neuronal homeostasis is recognized, with its dysfunction being implicated in neurodegenerative processes, notably in Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, the molecular underpinnings of lysosome-related genes (LRGs) in the context of PD remain partially elucidated. We collected RNA-seq data from the brain substantia nigra of 30 PD patients and 20 normal subjects from the GEO database. We obtained molecular classification clusters from the screened lysosomal expression patterns. The lysosome-related diagnostic model of Parkinson's disease was constructed by XGBoost and Random Forest. And we validated the expression patterns of signature LRGs in the diagnostic model by constructing a PD rat model. Finally, the linkage between PD and cancer through signature genes was explored. The expression patterns of the 33 LRGs screened can be divided into two groups of PD samples, enabling exploration of the variance in biological processes and immune elements. Cluster A had a higher disease severity. Subsequently, critical genes were sieved through the application of machine learning methodologies culminating in the identification of two intersecting feature genes (ACP2 and LRP2). A PD risk prediction model was constructed grounded on these signature genes. The model's validity was assessed through nomogram evaluation, which demonstrated robust confidence validity. Then we analyzed the correlation analysis, immune in-filtration, biological function, and rat expression validation of the two genes with common pathogenic genes in Parkinson's disease, indicating that these two genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. We then selected ACP2, which had a significant immune infiltration correlation, as the entry gene for the pan-cancer analysis. The pan-cancer analysis revealed that ACP2 has profound associations with prognostic indicators, immune infiltration, and tumor-related regulatory processes across various neoplasms, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in a range of human diseases, including PD and cancers. Our study comprehensively analyzed the molecular grouping of LRGs expression patterns in Parkinson's disease, and the disease progression was more severe in cluster A. And the PD diagnosis model related to LRGs is constructed. Finally, ACP2 is a potential target for the relationship between Parkinson's disease and tumor.
88	88	38272954	A mutation in TAC1 correlates to Parkinson's Disease	TAC1	Parkinson's Disease	0	"This biomedical abstract does not explicitly support the statement that mutations in TAC1 correlate to Parkinson's Disease (PD), but it does present data that TAC1 could be a significant gene of interest in the context of PD diagnosis and pathogenesis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the abstract's support and limitations regarding the statement:

Supportive Aspects
1. **Identification as a Potential Diagnostic Biomarker**: The abstract identifies TAC1 among seven genes with potential as diagnostic biomarkers for PD based on Lasso Cox regression analysis. This suggests a role for TAC1 in PD, although it does not specify the nature of this role, whether as a result of mutations or general expression changes.

2. **Gene Expression Profiling**: TAC1 was found among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in substantia nigra (SN) tissues of PD patients, highlighting its relevance in the disease context.

3. **Validation and Sensitivity/Specificity**: The potential of TAC1 as a diagnostic biomarker was validated in peripheral blood samples and additional datasets, showing exceptional sensitivity and specificity. This supports its relevance in PD, potentially linked to changes in expression patterns rather than specific mutations.

Limitations
1. **Lack of Specific Mutation Analysis**: The study does not specifically mention mutations in TAC1; it discusses gene expression differences. Therefore, the statement about mutations in TAC1 correlating with PD isn't directly supported.

2. **Gene Function Unclear**: The functional role of TAC1 in PD pathogenesis or its impact on PD progression is not detailed. The study focuses more on the diagnostic potential of gene expression levels.

3. **Methodology Focused on Expression, Not Genetic Variation**: The methodologies used, such as RRA analysis and PPI networks, focus on expression levels and interactions rather than genetic mutations or variations directly linked to PD.

Conclusion
While the study highlights TAC1 as a significant gene in the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, it does not provide evidence that mutations in TAC1 are associated with PD. The abstract supports the relevance of TAC1 in PD but does so from the perspective of its expression and potential as a biomarker, not through specific genetic mutations influencing disease susceptibility or progression. More research would be needed to specifically link TAC1 mutations to PD pathogenesis."	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is attributed to development of Lewy bodies and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic indicators for PD. In this study, we aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for PD and analyzed the impact of immune cell infiltrations on disease pathogenesis. The PD expression profile data for human SN tissue, GSE7621, GSE20141, GSE20159, GSE20163 and GSE20164 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for use in the training model. After normalization and merging, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Robust rank aggregation (RRA) analysis. Simultaneously, DEGs after batch correction were identified. Gene interactions were determined through venn Diagram analysis. Functional analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to the identify hub genes, which were visualized through Cytoscape. A Lasso Cox regression model was employed to identify the potential diagnostic genes. The GSE20292 dataset was used for validation. The proportion of infiltrating immune cells in the samples were determined via the CIBERSORT method. Sixty-two DEGs were screened in this study. They were found to be enriched in nerve conduction, dopamine (DA) metabolism, and DA biosynthesis Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The PPI network and Lasso Cox regression analysis revealed seven potential diagnostic genes, namely SLC18A2, TAC1, PCDH8, KIAA0319, PDE6H, AXIN1, and AGTR1, were subsequently validated in peripheral blood samples obtained from healthy control (HC) and PD patients, as well as in the GSE20292 dataset. The results revealed the exceptional sensitivity and specificity of these genes in PD diagnosis and monitoring. Moreover, PD patients exhibited a higher number of plasma cells, compared to HC individuals. The SLC18A2, TAC1, PCDH8, KIAA0319, PDE6H, AXIN1, and AGTR1 are potential diagnostic biomarkers for PD. Our findings also reveal the essential roles of immune cell infiltration in both disease onset and trajectory.
42	42	31059310	Peficitinib could be a treatment option for Rheumatoid arthritis	Peficitinib	Rheumatoid arthritis	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that peficitinib could be a treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Context and Need for New Treatments**: The introduction outlines the context of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, highlighting that while there are several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available, some patients either do not respond to these treatments or cannot take them due to adverse reactions. This sets the stage for the introduction of new treatment options.

2. **Role of JAK Inhibitors**: It notes the potential of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in providing significant breakthroughs in RA treatment. JAK inhibitors, including peficitinib, are described as potent and orally administered, which simplifies the treatment regimen for patients.

3. **Specifics about Peficitinib**: The abstract discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of peficitinib, emphasizing its role as a novel JAK3 inhibitor. Peficitinib's ability to inhibit JAK3 enzymatic activity and JAK1/3-mediated cell proliferation positions it as a promising therapeutic option.

4. **Comparative Efficacy and Selectivity**: Peficitinib's selectivity for JAK family kinases is compared to that of tofacitinib, another JAK inhibitor, noting that peficitinib is slightly less potent for JAK2 but similar in its overall selectivity. This comparison helps to contextualize peficitinib within the broader category of JAK inhibitors.

5. **Regulatory Evaluation**: The abstract mentions that peficitinib is currently being evaluated by the FDA for treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate. This ongoing regulatory review underscores its potential entry into clinical use.

6. **Usage and Combination Therapy**: It is highlighted that peficitinib can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs, which provides flexibility in how it might be integrated into existing treatment regimens.

7. **Safety Considerations**: While supporting peficitinib as a treatment option, the abstract also calls for cautious consideration and monitoring for adverse events, reflecting a balanced view on its introduction based on safety results from ongoing clinical studies.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides substantial evidence supporting the potential of peficitinib as a treatment option for RA, particularly for patients who are nonresponsive or intolerant to other treatments. By discussing its mechanisms, comparative efficacy, regulatory status, and flexible application in treatment regimens, the abstract effectively supports the statement that peficitinib could be a viable treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis."	<b>Introduction</b>: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease characterized by synovitis as well as symmetric and destructive arthropathy. Although several disease modified antirheumatic-drugs (DMARDs) have widely used in clinical practice, certain patients are nonresponsive to or cannot take such medications due to adverse reactions. It is evident that Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have the potential to provide a significant breakthrough in the treatment of RA. These potent, orally administered, JAK inhibitors simplify the treatment options for patients. <b>Areas covered</b>: We discuss the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of peficitinib for the treatment of RA. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Peficitinib is a novel JAK3 inhibitor potently inhibiting JAK3 enzymatic activity and JAK1/3-mediated cell proliferation. Its selectivity for JAK family kinases is similar to that of tofacitinib, but slightly less potent for JAK2. It is currently being evaluated by the FDA to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who show inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate. It can be used either as monotherapy or combination therapy with methotrexate, or other DMARDs. However, we think that more cautious consideration and measurement for adverse events are needed, after considering the safety results of ongoing clinical studies of peficitinib.
45	45	32240302	Increased expression of JUND can lead to greater resistance to cisplatin	JUND	Cisplatin	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that increased expression of JUND can lead to greater resistance to cisplatin. Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Context and Problem Statement**: The abstract begins by highlighting the standard treatment for metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with platinum-based chemotherapy, specifically cisplatin (CDDP), and notes the major issue of acquired resistance to this treatment.

2. **JUND Expression and Cisplatin Resistance**: It reports that expression of JUND, part of the activator protein-1 family, is significantly induced in cisplatin-resistant MIBC cases. This finding directly associates higher levels of JUND with reduced effectiveness of cisplatin, suggesting that JUND might be involved in mechanisms that confer resistance to the drug.

3. **Clinical and Survival Data**: The study notes an association between nuclear accumulation of JUND and lower post-chemotherapy survival rates in MIBC patients, which underscores the clinical relevance of JUND expression in affecting treatment outcomes.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The abstract describes experiments using genetically engineered cell models and murine xenograft models, which provided evidence that bladder cancer cells with high JUND expression were less responsive to cisplatin treatment. This experimental data confirms the role of JUND in mediating resistance at the cellular level.

5. **Mechanism of Resistance**: The resistance mediated by JUND is linked to the transactivation of HMOX1, which encodes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a key enzyme in antioxidant signaling pathways that help cells adapt to stress. This pathway is particularly relevant in the context of chemotherapy resistance, as it can protect cancer cells from the oxidative damage typically induced by drugs like cisplatin.

6. **Specific Genetic Evidence**: A mutation within the HMOX1 promoter that abolished oxidative stress-enhanced and JUND-driven promoter activation was identified, highlighting a specific site where JUND interacts to induce HO-1 expression maximally in the context of cisplatin treatment. This detailed molecular insight further solidifies the role of JUND in fostering a cellular environment conducive to resisting cisplatin effects.

7. **Conclusion and Implications for Treatment**: By concluding that JUND plays an indispensable role in conferring adaptive responses during the development of cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer, the abstract supports targeting JUND or related pathways as a potential strategy to overcome or mitigate this resistance.

**Overall**, the abstract provides robust evidence linking increased expression of JUND to enhanced resistance to cisplatin in bladder cancer, thus supporting the statement. The findings suggest that JUND could be a valuable target for therapeutic intervention to improve cisplatin efficacy in resistant cancer types."	The standard-of-care for metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Acquired resistance that occurs frequently through unidentified mechanisms, however, remains the major obstacle for implementing therapeutic effectiveness. Here, using data mining and analysis on clinical samples, we show that expression of JUND, a core component of activator protein-1 family, was significantly induced in cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant MIBC. Accumulation of nuclear JUND was associated with low post-chemotherapy survival in MIBC patients. In both genetically engineered cell models and murine xenograft models, we provided evidence that bladder cancer (BC) cells with excessive JUND expression were less responsive to CDDP treatment. This CDDP resistance was further demonstrated to be mediated, at least in part, by transactivation of HMOX1 [the gene encoding heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], one of the most important antioxidant signalling pathways of cell adaptation to stress. One mutation within the HMOX1 promoter successfully abolished oxidative stress-enhanced and JUND-driven HMOX1 promoter activation, suggesting that this unique site synergized for maximal HO-1 induction in CDDP-challenged BC cells. Overall, our data highlight an indispensible role of JUND, both as a target as a modifier of the oxidative stress signalling, in conferring an adaptive response during the pathogenesis of CDDP resistance in MIBC.
65	65	37488473	Mutations in ANXA9 cause Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	ANXA9	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	0	"The biomedical abstract does not provide direct support for the statement that mutations in ANXA9 cause Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here's why:

1. **Study Focus and Methodology**: The study uses weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene modules correlated with the severity of NAFLD. While this method can highlight genes associated with disease severity, it does not establish causality. It primarily points to correlations between gene expression patterns and disease stages.

2. **Identification of Driving Genes**: The study identifies ANXA9 as one of several ""driving genes"" in modules correlated with NAFLD severity. Being listed as a driving gene implies that ANXA9's expression is associated with the condition. However, the term ""driving gene"" here is used to denote a gene whose expression patterns are significantly associated with the disease traits studied, rather than implying a direct causal role in disease pathogenesis.

3. **Lack of Specific Evidence for ANXA9's Role**: Although ANXA9 is mentioned as one of the genes of interest, the abstract does not provide specific evidence or detailed analysis on how ANXA9 contributes to NAFLD. The study does not mention any functional studies, mutation analyses, or mechanistic insights specifically linking ANXA9 to NAFLD development or progression.

4. **Focus on C/EBPα**: The abstract emphasizes findings related to C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α), including its upregulation in NAFLD and its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. The prominence of C/EBPα in the results suggests that this gene was a more significant focus of the study compared to ANXA9, whose specific role in NAFLD is not detailed.

5. **General Conclusion**: The conclusion of the study highlights the identification of gene modules and driving genes associated with NAFLD progression and suggests these genes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This broad statement suggests a general association but does not confirm a causative role for any specific gene, including ANXA9.

**Conclusion**: While the abstract suggests that ANXA9 is associated with NAFLD through its identification in relevant gene modules, it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the statement that mutations in ANXA9 cause NAFLD. More detailed genetic and functional analyses would be required to establish a causative link between specific mutations in ANXA9 and the development of NAFLD."	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive liver fat deposition, and progresses to liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the invasive diagnosis of NAFLD with histopathological evaluation remains risky. This study investigated potential genes correlated with NAFLD, which may serve as diagnostic biomarkers and even potential treatment targets. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed based on dataset E-MEXP-3291. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to evaluate the function of genes. Blue module was positively correlated, and turquoise module negatively correlated with the severity of NAFLD. Furthermore, 8 driving genes (ANXA9, FBXO2, ORAI3, NAGS, C/EBPα, CRYAA, GOLM1, TRIM14) were identified from the overlap of genes in blue module and GSE89632. And another 8 driving genes were identified from the overlap of turquoise module and GSE89632. Among these driving genes, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α) was the most notable. By validating the expression of C/EBPα in the liver of NAFLD mice using immunohistochemistry, we discovered a significant upregulation of C/EBPα protein in NAFLD. we identified two modules and 16 driving genes associated with the progression of NAFLD, and confirmed the protein expression of C/EBPα, which had been paid little attention to in the context of NAFLD, in the present study. Our study will advance the understanding of NAFLD. Moreover, these driving genes may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of NAFLD.
13	13	37649161	A mutation in APOO can lead to mitochondrial disease	APOO	Mitochondrial Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in APOO can lead to mitochondrial disease. The evidence provided in the abstract directly links a specific mutation in the APOO/MIC26 gene to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and associated clinical phenotypes in two patients. Here's how the abstract supports this claim:

1. **Identification of Mutation**: The abstract reports a novel variant in the APOO/MIC26 gene, specifically a nonsense mutation (c.532G>T; p.E178*) that results in the premature truncation of the MIC26 protein. This truncation leads to the loss of 20 C-terminal amino acids, crucial for the protein's stability and function.

2. **Functional Impact of Mutation**: The mutation causes the MIC26 protein to become highly unstable and prone to degradation. Although the truncated MIC26 protein can still localize to mitochondria and interact with other subunits of the MICOS complex, its functionality is severely impaired.

3. **Mitochondrial Morphology and Function**: Cells expressing the mutant MIC26 show significant mitochondrial defects, including perturbed cristae architecture and fragmented mitochondrial morphology. These cellular abnormalities are consistent with those observed in MIC26 knockout (KO) cells, indicating that the mutation effectively mimics a knockout situation.

4. **Clinical Manifestations**: The two patients with this mutation developed severe mitochondrial disease characterized by a spectrum of serious clinical manifestations, including progeria-like phenotypes, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral congenital cataracts, hypothyroidism, and severe immune deficiencies. Both patients died at an early age (12 and 18 months), underscoring the mutation's severe impact.

5. **Conclusion of Loss-of-Function**: The study concludes that the mutation is a loss-of-function mutation that impairs mitochondrial morphology and cristae morphogenesis. This dysfunctional mitochondrial structure and function directly contribute to the observed disease phenotypes.

Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that mutations in the APOO/MIC26 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disease through disruptions in mitochondrial structure and function, thereby validating the statement that a mutation in APOO can lead to mitochondrial disease."	APOO/MIC26 is a subunit of the MICOS complex required for mitochondrial cristae morphology and function. Here, we report a novel variant of the APOO/MIC26 gene that causes a severe mitochondrial disease with overall progeria-like phenotypes in two patients. Both patients developed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral congenital cataract, hypothyroidism, and severe immune deficiencies. The patients died at an early age of 12 or 18 months. Exome sequencing revealed a mutation (NM_024122.5): c.532G>T (p.E178*) in the APOO/MIC26 gene that causes a nonsense mutation leading to the loss of 20 C-terminal amino acids. This mutation resulted in a highly unstable and degradation prone MIC26 protein, yet the remaining minute amounts of mutant MIC26 correctly localized to mitochondria and interacted physically with other MICOS subunits. MIC26 KO cells expressing MIC26 harboring the respective APOO/MIC26 mutation showed mitochondria with perturbed cristae architecture and fragmented morphology resembling MIC26 KO cells. We conclude that the novel mutation found in the APOO/MIC26 gene is a loss-of-function mutation impairing mitochondrial morphology and cristae morphogenesis.
27	27	33930186	Mutations in PGRN are linked to dementia	PGRN	Dementia	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that mutations in the PGRN (progranulin) gene are linked to dementia. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of PGRN in Neurodegeneration**: The abstract emphasizes that progranulin (PGRN) is a neurotrophic factor with various neuroprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, promoting neuron survival and neurite growth, and participation in normal lysosomal function. These roles indicate that PGRN is critical for maintaining neuronal health and function.

2. **Association with Neurodegenerative Dementias**: It is specifically noted that mutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) have been found in several types of neurodegenerative dementias, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This direct mention of mutations in GRN being present in dementia cases establishes a clear link between PGRN mutations and these neurodegenerative conditions.

3. **Pathological Changes and PGRN Deficiency**: The abstract discusses how PGRN deficiency contributes to various pathological changes associated with dementia. These include the aggregation of tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), overproduction of amyloid-beta (Aβ), neuroinflammation, lysosomal dysfunction, neuronal death, and synaptic deficits. Each of these pathological features is central to the progression of dementia, particularly in diseases like FTLD and AD.

4. **Therapeutic Potential of Targeting PGRN**: Highlighting PGRN as a target for therapeutic strategies in various models of neurodegeneration further supports the importance of PGRN in dementia. The development of therapies aimed at augmenting PGRN levels or function suggests that enhancing PGRN activity could mitigate the progression or onset of dementia symptoms.

5. **Summary of PGRN’s Impact**: By summarizing the effects of PGRN deficiency and the therapeutic potential of targeting PGRN, the abstract underscores the significant impact that PGRN has on neurodegenerative processes leading to dementia. It also implies that understanding and potentially correcting PGRN dysfunction is crucial for addressing these debilitating diseases.

In conclusion, the abstract provides substantial evidence that mutations in the PGRN gene are linked to the development of dementia, through both the direct association of these mutations with neurodegenerative diseases and the detailed explanation of how PGRN impacts key pathological processes involved in these conditions."	Long-term or severe lack of protective factors is important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementia. Progranulin (PGRN), a neurotrophic factor expressed mainly in neurons and microglia, has various neuroprotective effects such as anti-inflammatory effects, promoting neuron survival and neurite growth, and participating in normal lysosomal function. Mutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) have been found in several neurodegenerative dementias, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, PGRN deficiency and PGRN hydrolytic products (GRNs) in the pathological changes related to dementia, including aggregation of tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), amyloid-β (Aβ) overproduction, neuroinflammation, lysosomal dysfunction, neuronal death, and synaptic deficit have been summarized. Furthermore, as some therapeutic strategies targeting PGRN have been developed in various models, we highlighted PGRN as a potential anti-neurodegeneration target in dementia.
81	81	20389169	Increased expression of RAF1 is associated with cryptorchidism	RAF1	cryptorchidism	0	"The biomedical abstract you provided does not support the statement that increased expression of RAF1 is associated with cryptorchidism. In fact, the findings from this study indicate the opposite:

1. **Expression Levels**: The study found that RAF1, along with FGFR1 and SOS1, was expressed less in undescended testes compared to descended testes. This suggests a downregulation of RAF1 in the context of cryptorchidism.

2. **Implications for Cryptorchidism**: The abstract suggests that a subtle dysfunction (including lower expression) of RAF1 might be involved in the development of cryptorchidism. This is contrary to the statement that increased expression of RAF1 is associated with this condition.

3. **Gene Function Context**: Cryptorchidism is the most common male reproductive tract disorder, and the study aimed to analyze gene expression differences to better understand the genetic factors involved. The discovery that RAF1 is underexpressed in cryptorchid testes could indicate its potential role in normal testicular descent, which is disrupted when RAF1 expression is diminished.

4. **Study Focus and Results**: The focus of the study was on identifying differences in gene expression profiles between cryptorchid and descended testes, and the significant result concerning RAF1 was its reduced expression in cryptorchidism, suggesting a possible protective or necessary role of normal RAF1 levels in testicular descent.

In summary, the abstract actually indicates that decreased, not increased, expression of RAF1 might be involved in cryptorchidism, thus not supporting the initial statement."	In recent years, several genes were found to be involved in the process of epididymo-testicular descent, the most frequently cited ones include INSL3, HOXA10, GNRHR, and KAL1. In this study, we analyzed the differences in gene expression profiles between cryptorchid and descended testes. In particular, we analyzed expression of all recently published genes known to be associated with undescended testis. Twenty-two testicular biopsies from 18 boys were analyzed. We analyzed gene expression in 16 cryptorchid and 6 descended testes using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, and validated the results with qPCR. 3,688 transcripts were differentially expressed with an adjusted p value of <0.05 and a change of at least 1.5-fold. The list contained 1,866 downregulated and 1,822 upregulated transcripts in the cryptorchid testes. A novel observation in our study was that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) and its mediators SOS1 and RAF1 were expressed less in undescended testes. Based on our results, it is possible that a subtle dysfunction (expression) of the FGFR1, SOS1 and RAF1 genes is involved in the development of the most common male reproductive tract disorder - unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.
23	23	24640679	A mutation in IL-28B contributes directly to the susceptibility of hepatitis C virus	IL-28B	Hepatitis C Virus	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in IL-28B contributes directly to the susceptibility of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here’s how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Focus on IL-28B Gene**: The abstract discusses the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IL-28B gene, directly linking it to various aspects of HCV infection. IL-28B is part of the interferon-lambda family, which plays a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections, including HCV.

2. **Impact on Antiviral Therapy**: Significant attention in the abstract is given to how allelic variants of IL-28B affect the response to antiviral therapies. The efficacy of these therapies can be influenced by genetic variants, which suggests that IL-28B variants might impact not just the susceptibility to HCV but also the outcome of the infection and treatment response. This supports the idea that IL-28B mutations could play a critical role in the overall dynamics of HCV infection.

3. **Biological Role and Clinical Associations**: The abstract notes the biological role of interferon-lambda (produced by IL-28B and related genes) and discusses other associations of IL-28B allelic variants with different clinical signs of chronic hepatitis C. This broad discussion about the genetic marker’s impact on disease presentation and progression underscores its direct relevance to HCV susceptibility.

4. **Practical and Future Use of Genetic Marker**: The mention of the practical use of the IL-28B genetic marker in managing chronic hepatitis C, along with future prospects, indicates that understanding variations in this gene is considered valuable for both current medical practices and upcoming medical research and treatments. This also suggests an established link between IL-28B variations and significant clinical outcomes in HCV-infected individuals.

In summary, the abstract supports the idea that mutations in the IL-28B gene contribute directly to the susceptibility and management of hepatitis C virus infection by detailing how these genetic variations affect the disease’s clinical course and response to treatment. The specific focus on the IL-28B SNP and its implications in the context of HCV infection clearly aligns with the statement that mutations in this gene influence HCV susceptibility."	Chronic hepatitis C remains one of the most urgent problems of today's medicine. The review unravels the current view of the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) gene in different aspects of hepatitis C virus infection. Major attention is paid to the discussion of the value of the allelic variants of IL-28B during standard double and current triple antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, the paper covers the biological role of interferon-lambda, a product of IL-28A, B, and IL-29 gene expression, other associations of the allelic variants of the IL-28B gene with different clinical signs, as well as the possibilities of practical use of this genetic marker in chronic hepatitis C today and futures prospects.
21	21	37298659	Masitinib can be used as treatment for hepatitis A virus infections	Masitinib	hepatitis A virus	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that masitinib can be used as treatment for hepatitis A virus (HAV). Here’s how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Problem Statement**: The abstract starts by noting the lack of potent anti-HAV drugs available for clinical use, highlighting the need for effective treatments against HAV, which can cause acute hepatitis and more severe liver failures.

2. **Development of a New Testing Model**: The study describes the creation of HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells—a cell model that stably expresses HAV replicon RNA along with a firefly luciferase reporter. This model was developed to facilitate the screening of drugs for anti-HAV activity, indicating the seriousness of finding effective treatments.

3. **Screening of FDA-Approved Drugs**: The researchers screened 1134 FDA-approved drugs using this new cell model to identify potential candidates with anti-HAV properties.

4. **Finding on Masitinib**: Masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was found to significantly reduce the replication of two different genotypes of HAV (HM175-18f genotype IB and HA11-1299 genotype IIIA) in vitro. This demonstrates masitinib's potential effectiveness against multiple strains of the virus.

5. **Mechanism of Action**: The abstract also notes that masitinib significantly inhibited the activity of the HAV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which is crucial for viral protein synthesis and replication. This suggests that masitinib impacts HAV replication by interfering with a critical step in the viral life cycle.

6. **Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that masitinib may be useful for the treatment of severe HAV infection, based on its demonstrated ability to inhibit HAV replication in the newly developed cell model.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence that masitinib has potential as an anti-HAV agent, as it effectively reduced HAV replication in vitro across different viral genotypes and also targeted a key mechanism of the viral replication process. This supports the potential use of masitinib in treating hepatitis A virus infections, particularly in severe cases where current therapeutic options are inadequate."	The hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection causes acute hepatitis. HAV also induces acute liver failure or acute-on-chronic liver failure; however, no potent anti-HAV drugs are currently available in clinical situations. For anti-HAV drug screening, more convenient and useful models that mimic HAV replication are needed. In the present study, we established HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells, which are HuhT7 cells stably expressing the HAV HM175-18f genotype IB subgenomic replicon RNA harboring the firefly luciferase gene. This system was made by using a PiggyBac-based gene transfer system that introduces nonviral transposon DNA into mammalian cells. Then, we investigated whether 1134 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs exhibited in vitro anti-HAV activity. We further demonstrated that treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor masitinib significantly reduced both HAV HM175-18f genotype IB replication and HAV HA11-1299 genotype IIIA replication. Masitinib also significantly inhibited HAV HM175 internal ribosomal entry-site (IRES) activity. In conclusion, HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells are adequate for anti-HAV drug screening, and masitinib may be useful for the treatment of severe HAV infection.
79	79	18805672	PAK3 mutations are associated with schizophrenia in all cases	PAK3	schizophrenia	0	"This biomedical abstract does not support the statement that PAK3 mutations are associated with schizophrenia in all cases. Here's why:

1. **Specific Subtype Association**: The study specifically investigates the association of PAK3 mutations with schizophrenia in patients who do not have premorbid mental retardation (MR). The findings suggest that while PAK3 mutations are known to be linked with cognitive developmental issues and psychotic disorders including a specific type called ""pfropfschizophrenie"" (where schizophrenia involves premorbid MR), such mutations are not common in cases of schizophrenia without premorbid MR.

2. **Low Frequency of Deleterious Variants**: The research identifies that deleterious variants in PAK3 are rare in the subgroup of schizophrenia patients without premorbid MR (found in less than 0.6% of the cases studied). This indicates that while PAK3 may be a biological candidate for certain forms of psychosis, it is not a general factor in the broader spectrum of schizophrenia cases, especially those without intellectual disability.

3. **Distinction in Phenotype Association**: The study underscores the importance of distinguishing between different phenotypes of schizophrenia when considering genetic factors. The link between PAK3 mutations and schizophrenia seems to be confined to cases with associated cognitive impairments (intellectual disabilities) prior to the onset of schizophrenia.

4. **Implication for Genetic Testing and Research**: These findings suggest that genetic testing for PAK3 mutations in schizophrenia patients without prior intellectual disability might not be as beneficial or informative. It also implies that future genetic research and therapeutic interventions might need to consider the specific subtypes of schizophrenia for more targeted analysis.

Overall, the study detailed in the abstract provides a clear differentiation in the association of PAK3 mutations with schizophrenia, supporting its connection only in cases with premorbid intellectual disabilities and not broadly across all schizophrenia cases."	"The P21-activated kinase PAK3 is critical for cognitive development and truncating mutations cause non-syndromic mental retardation (MR). Missense mutations are also associated with psychotic disorders, most commonly with schizophrenia involving premorbid MR, namely ""pfropfschizophrenie"". We set out to measure the frequency of sequence variants in PAK3 in schizophrenia without premorbid MR. We conducted complete gene reseqeuncing of all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries in patients with schizophrenia with cognitive impairment but without premorbid MR. Deleterious variants in schizophrenia alone were rare (<1/159 or 0.6%). Thereby, while PAK3 remains a strong biological candidate in psychosis, evidence from human genetics provides strongest support for a link to pfropfschizophrenie and not to schizophrenia without premorbid intellectual disability."

1. **Lysosomal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease**: The abstract begins by highlighting the role of lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This sets the stage for discussing how specific genes related to lysosomal function impact PD.

2. **Role of GBA1**: It specifically points out that among lysosomal genes, GBA1 has the largest impact on Parkinson's disease risk. This direct statement underscores the importance of GBA1 in relation to PD.

3. **Mechanism of GBA1 Impact**: The abstract explains that a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is encoded by GBA1, leads to the accumulation of glycolipid substrates (glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine). This accumulation results in toxicity and inflammation, which adversely affect various clinical aspects of PD such as disease risk, severity, age of onset, and progression to dementia.

4. **Clinical Relevance of GBA1 Mutation**: The detailed description of how GBA1 mutations impact disease risk and progression in Parkinson's disease is significant. It indicates that mutations in GBA1 not only increase the likelihood of developing PD but also influence the clinical trajectory of the disease.

5. **Therapeutic Implications**: The abstract also discusses a therapeutic approach targeting GBA1 via gene therapy (PR001), which is designed to deliver a functional GBA1 gene to the brain. The mention of this therapy undergoing clinical trials for PD patients carrying GBA1 mutations further supports the critical role of GBA1 mutations in the disease. It implies that correcting the dysfunction caused by GBA1 mutations could potentially slow or stop the progression of PD.

6. **Conclusion on GBA1 and PD**: The assertion that re-establishing normal GCase enzyme activity might reduce the progression of PD in patients with GBA1 mutations is a strong indicator of the gene's impact on the disease.

Overall, the abstract provides comprehensive evidence that mutations in GBA1 are a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease, affecting its onset, severity, and progression. This directly supports the statement regarding the increased likelihood of PD with GBA1 mutations."	Human genetic studies as well as studies in animal models indicate that lysosomal dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Among the lysosomal genes involved, GBA1 has the largest impact on Parkinson's disease risk. Deficiency in the GBA1 encoded enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) leads to the accumulation of the GCase glycolipid substrates glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine and ultimately results in toxicity and inflammation and negatively affect many clinical aspects of Parkinson's disease, including disease risk, the severity of presentation, age of onset, and likelihood of progression to dementia. These findings support the view that re-establishing normal levels of GCase enzyme activity may reduce the progression of Parkinson's disease in patients carrying GBA1 mutations. Studies in mouse models indicate that PR001, a AAV9 vector-based gene therapy designed to deliver a functional GBA1 gene to the brain, suggest that this therapeutic approach may slow or stop disease progression. PR001 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials with Parkinson's disease patients carrying GBA1 mutations.
38	38	7633410	Inversion of the IDS gene is the leading cause for Hunter Syndrome	IDS	Hunter Syndrome	0	"The biomedical abstract provides evidence that inversion of the IDS gene, due to recombination with a nearby IDS-2 locus, is a significant mechanism causing Hunter Syndrome, but it does not support the statement that it is the leading cause of the disease. Here’s an analysis of how the abstract relates to this topic:

1. **Prevalence of Recombination Events**: The abstract states that the recombination event involving the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus occurs in about 13% of patients with Hunter Syndrome. This percentage indicates that while this type of recombination is a clear contributor to the disease, it occurs in a minority of the cases.

2. **Nature of the Genetic Rearrangement**: It describes a specific genetic rearrangement where recombination results in the disruption of the IDS gene at intron 7, accompanied by an inversion of the intervening DNA. This disruption and inversion interfere with the normal function of the IDS gene, which is crucial for the breakdown of certain complex molecules in the body, leading to the symptoms of Hunter Syndrome.

3. **Recombination Hotspots**: The finding that all cases with this type of rearrangement involve recombination between specific regions (intron 7 of the IDS gene and near exon 3 at the IDS-2 locus) suggests that these areas are prone to recombination, making them significant for genetic analysis and diagnostics.

4. **Molecular Analysis**: Nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the inversion is due to recombination between homologous sequences in the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus. This detailed molecular insight confirms the mechanism behind this genetic alteration without indicating additional deletions or insertions.

5. **Implications for Diagnosis**: The study underscores the importance of recognizing this specific genetic rearrangement in the diagnosis of Hunter Syndrome, implying that genetic testing for this inversion could be crucial for accurate diagnosis in a subset of patients.

**Conclusion**: Although the recombination event described in the abstract is clearly implicated in the development of Hunter Syndrome in a subset of patients, the evidence does not suggest it is the leading cause of the disease. The statement that it occurs in about 13% of patients implies that other genetic mutations or mechanisms likely play a more predominant role in the majority of cases. Therefore, while the abstract supports the fact that IDS gene inversion is a cause of Hunter Syndrome, it does not establish it as the leading cause. Further research would be needed to determine the most common genetic changes causing the majority of Hunter Syndrome cases."	We have recently described the identification of a second IDS locus (IDS-2) located within 90 kb telomeric of the IDS gene (Bondeson et al. submitted). Here, we show that this region is involved in a recombination event with the IDS gene in about 13% of patients with the Hunter syndrome. Analysis of the resulting rearrangement at the molecular level showed that these patients have suffered a recombination event that results in a disruption of the IDS gene in intron 7 with an inversion of the intervening DNA. Interestingly, all of the six cases with a similar type of rearrangement showed recombination between intron 7 of the IDS gene and sequences close to exon 3 at the IDS-2 locus implying that these regions are hot spots for recombination. Analysis by nucleotide sequencing showed that the inversion is caused by recombination between homologous sequences present in the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus. No detectable deletions or insertions were observed as a result of the recombination event. The results in this study have practical implications for diagnosis of the Hunter syndrome.
61	61	31468281	Mutations in NAGA lead to Schindler disease	NAGA	Schindler disease	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that mutations in the NAGA gene lead to Schindler disease. Here is how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Identification of Disease and Genetic Cause**: The abstract states that Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by defects in the NAGA gene, which encodes the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGA). This establishes a direct link between mutations in the NAGA gene and the disease.

2. **Specific Genetic Mutation**: The abstract details a specific homozygous missense variant (c.838C>A; p.L280I) in the NAGA gene identified in a patient with severe neurological manifestations of Schindler disease. This mutation is presented as causal due to its effects on enzyme function and clinical presentation.

3. **Biochemical Evidence**: It is reported that α-NAGA activity was significantly reduced in the proband and his sister, both carrying the same mutation, supporting the dysfunction caused by this specific genetic change. The enzyme activity levels were much lower than normal, correlating with the disease phenotype.

4. **Functional Impact of the Mutation**: Further functional analysis, including protein molecular dynamic simulation, showed that the L280I substitution affects the enzyme's dynamics and its ability to bind to the active site, providing a mechanistic understanding of how the mutation causes disease by hindering enzyme function.

5. **Clinical Heterogeneity**: Despite similar genetic profiles, there is noted variability in the disease expression among family members, indicating that other genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors may influence the severity of the disease. This points to the complex nature of genetic disorders and the impact of single mutations.

6. **Diagnosis Confirmation**: The diagnosis of Schindler disease in the proband was confirmed through clinical, biochemical, and genetic analyses, linking the observed symptoms and biochemical abnormalities directly to the mutation in the NAGA gene.

7. **Implications for Genetic Counseling and Management**: The abstract concludes with the necessity for further studies due to the clinical heterogeneity observed, emphasizing the importance of understanding such mutations for genetic counseling and disease management.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides a comprehensive account of how mutations in the NAGA gene are associated with Schindler disease, supporting the initial statement with detailed genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence. It highlights the critical role of the NAGA gene in the disease's pathology and the importance of genetic analysis in diagnosing and managing rare genetic disorders."	Schindler disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGA) activity due to defects in the NAGA gene. Accumulation of the enzyme's substrates results in clinically heterogeneous symptoms ranging from asymptomatic individuals to individuals with severe neurological manifestations. Here, a 5-year-old Emirati male born to consanguineous parents presented with congenital microcephaly and severe neurological manifestations. Whole genome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense variant (c.838C>A; p.L280I) in the NAGA gene. The allele is a reported SNP in the ExAC database with a 0.0007497 allele frequency. The proband's asymptomatic sister and cousin carry the same genotype in a homozygous state as revealed from the family screening. Due to the extreme intrafamilial heterogeneity of the disease as seen in previously reported cases, we performed further analyses to establish the pathogenicity of this variant. Both the proband and his sister showed abnormal urine oligosaccharide patterns, which is consistent with the diagnosis of Schindler disease. The α-NAGA activity was significantly reduced in the proband and his sister with 5.9% and 12.1% of the mean normal activity, respectively. Despite the activity loss, p.L280I α-NAGA processing and trafficking were not affected. However, protein molecular dynamic simulation analysis revealed that this amino acid substitution is likely to affect the enzyme's natural dynamics and hinders its ability to bind to the active site. Functional analysis confirmed the pathogenicity of the identified missense variant and the diagnosis of Schindler disease. Extreme intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity of the disease necessitates further studies for proper genetic counseling and management.
85	85	36617784	TAC1 has no association with Alzheimers disease	TAC1	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that ""TAC1 has no association with Alzheimer's disease."" Instead, it provides evidence suggesting a potential association. Here's why:

1. **Identification as a Hub Gene**: The abstract mentions that TAC1 was identified as a hub gene in the analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) in Alzheimer's disease patients' frontal cortex samples. Hub genes are typically central in gene regulatory networks and can play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of diseases.

2. **Involvement in Synaptic Function and Inflammation**: The study highlighted that TAC1 may be related to important biological processes such as synaptic function and inflammation, both of which are significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Synaptic dysfunction is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease, and inflammation has been increasingly recognized as a contributor to the disease process.

3. **Downregulation in Disease Models**: The study further validated the expression levels of TAC1 in the cortex of 5xFAD mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease, where TAC1 was found to be downregulated. This change in expression in an AD model supports the gene’s potential involvement in the disease.

4. **Use of Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA)**: The RRA approach was used to identify DEGs across multiple studies, suggesting that the findings regarding TAC1 are likely to be robust and replicated across different datasets.

Therefore, based on the findings presented in the abstract, TAC1 appears to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, contrary to the statement that it has no association."	Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings heavy burden to society and family. There is an urgent need to find effective methods for disease diagnosis and treatment. The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach that could aggregate the resulting gene lists has been widely utilized in genomic data analysis. To identify hub genes using RRA approach in AD. Seven microarray datasets in frontal cortex from GEO database were used to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) in AD patients using RRA approach. STRING was performed to explore the protein-to-protein interaction (PPI). Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were utilized for enrichment analysis. Human Gene Connectome and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used for functional annotation. Finally, the expression levels of hub genes were validated in the cortex of 5xFAD mice by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After RRA analysis, 473 DEGs (216 upregulated and 257 downregulated) were identified in AD samples. PPI showed that DEGs had a total of 416 nodes and 2750 edges. These genes were divided into 17 clusters, each of which contains at least three genes. After functional annotation and enrichment analysis, TAC1 is identified as the hub gene and may be related to synaptic function and inflammation. In addition, Tac1 was found downregulated in cortices of 5xFAD mice. In the current study, TAC1 is identified as a key gene in the frontal cortex of AD, providing insight into the possible pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for this disease.
