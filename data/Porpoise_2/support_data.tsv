0	33340485	A mutation In APOE contributes to Alzheimer's 	APOE	Alzheimers	1	"
This biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that a mutation in APOE contributes to Alzheimer's disease. Here are the key points that corroborate this assertion:

Genetic Risk and Protection: The abstract specifies that the APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and the APOE ε2 allele is the strongest genetic protective factor. This direct correlation between specific alleles of APOE and the risk or protection against Alzheimer's disease emphasizes the genetic involvement of APOE in the pathology of the disease.

Expanded Understanding of APOE Pathogenesis: Initially, APOE's role was linked primarily to amyloid-β peptide aggregation and clearance. The abstract mentions that recent research over the past five years has expanded the understanding of APOE’s role in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis to include other critical pathways such as tau neurofibrillary degeneration, responses from microglia and astrocytes, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. This broader understanding implicates APOE in multiple mechanisms contributing to Alzheimer's, not just through amyloid-β interactions.

Therapeutic Approaches in Models: The abstract discusses several experimental therapeutic approaches targeting APOE that have been successful in mouse models. These include manipulating APOE levels, enhancing its lipidation, blocking its interaction with amyloid-β peptide, and genetically altering the APOE4 isoform to less pathogenic isoforms like APOE3 or APOE2. The success of these interventions in models further supports the role of APOE mutations in the development of Alzheimer's disease, as these therapies are designed based on the genetic variations of APOE and their pathological consequences.

Challenges in Clinical Translation: The mention of difficulties in translating these therapies from mouse models to human clinical trials underscores the complexity of APOE's role in Alzheimer's and the challenges it presents for treatment. However, the ongoing efforts to translate these findings also highlight the significance of APOE as a therapeutic target, implying its crucial role in the disease."	The APOE ε4 allele remains the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and the APOE ε2 allele the strongest genetic protective factor after multiple large scale genome-wide association studies and genome-wide association meta-analyses. However, no therapies directed at APOE are currently available. Although initial studies causally linked APOE with amyloid-β peptide aggregation and clearance, over the past 5 years our understanding of APOE pathogenesis has expanded beyond amyloid-β peptide-centric mechanisms to tau neurofibrillary degeneration, microglia and astrocyte responses, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Because all these pathological processes can potentially contribute to cognitive impairment, it is important to use this new knowledge to develop therapies directed at APOE. Several therapeutic approaches have been successful in mouse models expressing human APOE alleles, including increasing or reducing APOE levels, enhancing its lipidation, blocking the interactions between APOE and amyloid-β peptide, and genetically switching APOE4 to APOE3 or APOE2 isoforms, but translation to human clinical trials has proven challenging.
1	22664493	A mutation in CFTR contributes to Asthma	CFTR	Asthma	0	"The abstract does not definitively support the statement that a mutation in the CFTR gene contributes to asthma, but it does indicate a potential connection that merits further investigation. Here's why:

1. **Hypothesis Mentioned**: The abstract mentions a hypothesis that individuals heterozygous for CFTR gene mutations (i.e., having one normal copy and one mutated copy of the CFTR gene) may develop obstructive pulmonary diseases like asthma. This suggests a possible link between CFTR mutations and asthma, but it is presented as a hypothesis rather than a confirmed finding.

2. **Phenotypic Heterogeneity**: The abstract highlights that there is great heterogeneity in the severity and presentation of CF lung disease, which could be influenced by genetic or environmental factors. This variability suggests that the effect of CFTR mutations could extend beyond cystic fibrosis to other pulmonary conditions like asthma, although this is not conclusively proven.

3. **Modifier Genes**: It is mentioned that several modifier genes could interact with the CFTR pathway and influence the severity of disease. This introduces the possibility that CFTR mutations, in conjunction with other genetic factors, could potentially impact asthma development or severity.

4. **Unclear Association**: The abstract explicitly states that the association between CFTR gene mutations and asthma is still unclear, with studies showing varied results—some indicate a positive or protective association, while others show no association at all. This indicates that the evidence is not yet strong or consistent enough to definitively link CFTR mutations to asthma.

5. **Call for More Research**: The abstract concludes that more studies with large sample sizes and detailed phenotyping are needed to define the potential role of CFTR in asthma pathogenesis. This underscores the current lack of definitive evidence and the need for further research to explore this potential connection.

In summary, while the abstract acknowledges a hypothesized link between CFTR mutations and asthma, it clearly states that the evidence is inconclusive at this time and more research is required to establish any definitive connection."	Mutation on both the copies of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene results in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a recessively transmitted genetic disorder. It is hypothesized that individuals heterozygous for CFTR gene mutation may develop obstructive pulmonary diseases like asthma. There is great heterogeneity in the phenotypic presentation and severity of CF lung disease. This could be due to genetic or environmental factors. Several modifier genes have been identified which may directly or indirectly interact with CFTR pathway and affect the severity of disease. This review article discusses the information related to the association of CFTR gene mutation with asthma. Association between CFTR gene mutation and asthma is still unclear. Report ranges from studies showing positive or protective association to those showing no association. Therefore, studies with sufficiently large sample size and detailed phenotype are required to define the potential contribution of CFTR in the pathogenesis of asthma.
2	26932604	Expression of STOML2 is associated with asthma risk	STOML2	Asthma	1	"This biomedical abstract provides direct support for the statement that the expression of STOML2 is associated with asthma risk. Here’s a breakdown of how it supports this claim:

1. **Initial Hypothesis and Approach**: The researchers hypothesized that genes co-expressed with the IL6R gene, which is known to be associated with asthma risk, might also be influenced by genetic polymorphisms linked to asthma. This sets the basis for investigating the relationship between STOML2 expression and asthma, given its correlation with IL6R.

2. **Gene Expression Analysis**: The study involved analyzing gene expression data from two significant datasets to find genes whose expression correlated with IL6R. This methodology is robust and allows for the identification of genes potentially involved in similar pathways or mechanisms as IL6R.

3. **Identification of Correlated Genes and SNPs**: The researchers identified 90 genes correlated with IL6R expression. They further screened these genes for nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that not only affected gene expression but were also associated with asthma risk according to asthma genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This dual-criteria screening is crucial as it links gene expression changes directly to disease risk.

4. **Specific Findings for STOML2**: Among the genes identified, STOML2 was highlighted as a novel gene associated with asthma risk. The expression of STOML2 was found to be negatively correlated with IL6R, and the SNPs increasing STOML2 expression were associated with higher asthma risk. This specific finding directly links increased expression of STOML2 with an increased risk of developing asthma.

5. **Replication and Validation**: The significance of these findings is strengthened by the replication of the SNP-expression-risk association in an independent asthma GWAS dataset. This replication is critical for validating the initial findings and confirming the robustness of the association between STOML2 expression and asthma risk.

6. **Conclusion and Role of STOML2**: The conclusion that STOML2 expression is associated with asthma risk is supported by its role in mitochondrial function and T-cell activation, both of which are relevant to asthma pathology. The link to IL-6 signaling, a well-known pathway involved in inflammation and asthma, further supports the biological plausibility of STOML2's role in asthma.

In summary, the abstract provides strong evidence that the expression of STOML2 is associated with an increased risk of asthma, making a clear case for its role in the disease's pathogenesis based on both genetic and expression analysis, along with replication in independent studies."	Functional variants in the interleukin-6 receptor gene (IL6R) are associated with asthma risk. We hypothesized that genes co-expressed with IL6R might also be regulated by genetic polymorphisms that are associated with asthma risk. The aim of this study was to identify such genes. To identify genes whose expression was correlated with that of IL6R, we analyzed gene expression levels generated for 373 human lymphoblastoid cell lines by the Geuvadis consortium and for 38 hematopoietic cell types by the Differentiation Map Portal (DMAP) project. Genes correlated with IL6R were then screened for nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with both variation in gene expression levels (eSNPs) and asthma risk. We identified 90 genes with expression levels correlated with those of IL6R and that also had a nearby eSNP associated with disease risk in a published asthma GWAS (N = 20 776). For 16 (18%) genes, the association between the eSNP and asthma risk replicated with the same direction of effect in a further independent published asthma GWAS (N = 27 378). Among the top replicated associations (FDR < 0.05) were eSNPs for four known (IL18R1, IL18RAP, BCL6, and STAT6) and one putative novel asthma risk gene, stomatin-like protein 2 (STOML2). The expression of STOML2 was negatively correlated with IL6R, while eSNPs that increased the expression of STOML2 were associated with an increased asthma risk. The expression of STOML2, a gene that plays a key role in mitochondrial function and T-cell activation, is associated with both IL-6 signaling and asthma risk.
3	29746266	Ibalizumab is effective in treating HIV-1	Ibalizumab	HIV-1	1	"The abstract clearly supports the statement that ""Ibalizumab is effective in treating HIV-1."" Here's a breakdown of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Purpose and Background**: The abstract sets the context by discussing the need for new antiretroviral agents for patients with multi-class resistant HIV-1. Ibalizumab is introduced as a new type of therapeutic agent—a parenteral CD4 postattachment inhibitor.

2. **Clinical Trial Results**: Key evidence for ibalizumab's effectiveness is provided by the results of a phase III clinical trial. It reports that ibalizumab, when administered intravenously, resulted in significant declines in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Specifically, there was a reduction of more than 0.5 log in 83% of participants at one week. Furthermore, after adding an optimized background antiretroviral regimen, the virus was suppressed to less than 50 copies/ml in 43% of participants at 24 weeks. This demonstrates a clear and effective viral load reduction when using ibalizumab in combination with other antiretrovirals.

3. **Safety Profile**: The abstract notes that adverse effects were uncommon and generally low grade, which supports the assertion of efficacy by indicating that not only does ibalizumab work well, but it also does so with a manageable safety profile.

4. **Regulatory Approval**: The mention of ibalizumab’s approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the trade name Trogarzo as of March 16, 2018, further validates its effectiveness and safety, as FDA approval involves a rigorous review of data from clinical trials to ensure that a drug is effective and safe for its intended use.

5. **Ongoing Development**: The abstract concludes with information about ongoing efforts to enhance ibalizumab, such as prolonging its clearance and broadening its activity. This points to its established role and continued potential in HIV-1 treatment strategies.

In summary, the abstract provides substantial evidence of ibalizumab's efficacy in treating HIV-1, particularly in challenging cases of multidrug-resistant virus, thereby strongly supporting the statement about its effectiveness."	Antiretroviral options for patients infected with multiclass resistant HIV-1 warrant the development of new agents with unique mechanisms of action and modes of delivery. Here we review one such agent, ibalizumab, a parenteral CD4 postattachment inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy as part of combination antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV-1. In a phase III clinical trial in HIV-infected participants with multiclass antiretroviral drug resistance, the intravenous administration of ibalizumab led to declines in plasma HIV-1 RNA more than 0.5 log in 83% of participants at 1 week. An optimized background antiretroviral regimen was then added, and plasma HIV-1 RNA became less than 50 copies/ml in 43% of participants at 24 weeks. Adverse effects of ibalizumab were uncommon and generally low grade. Ibalizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on March 16, 2018, under the trade name Trogarzo. Ibalizumab has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Its primary use will be in the setting of multidrug resistant virus as part of combination antiretroviral therapy. Further enhancements of ibalizumab to prolong its clearance and broaden its activity are in development.
4	28646505	Expression of BRG1 correlates with congenital heart disease	BRG1	Congenital heart disease	1	"The abstract provides support for the statement that the expression of BRG1 correlates with congenital heart disease (CHD), although it emphasizes more the relationship between altered (specifically decreased) expression and methylation of BRG1 in the context of CHD rather than a straightforward correlation. Here are the key points from the abstract that relate to this statement:

1. **Role of BRG1 in Cardiac Development**: The background mentions that BRG1, as part of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, is closely associated with cardiac development. This establishes the biological relevance of BRG1 in heart development and sets the stage for exploring its role in CHD.

2. **Methylation and Expression Analysis**: The study analyzed the methylation of the BRG1 gene and its expression in both normal and CHD-affected myocardium. It found that a specific region (CpG shore in the second intron of BRG1) was hypomethylated in CHD patients. Methylation typically affects gene expression, so changes in methylation patterns are significant.

3. **Expression Differences**: Crucially, BRG1 expression was reported to be significantly decreased by 70% in the myocardium of CHD patients compared to normal controls. This finding directly supports the idea that changes in BRG1 expression are associated with CHD.

4. **Correlation with GATA4**: The expression of GATA4, a critical transcription factor in heart development, was significantly correlated with BRG1 expression. Both were similarly decreased in CHD patients. This correlation not only strengthens the role of BRG1 in cardiac development but also suggests a potential mechanistic pathway involving GATA4 that could contribute to the pathogenesis of CHD.

5. **Conclusion and Implication**: The conclusion drawn is that the abnormal (decreased) expression of BRG1, potentially due to changes in methylation, affects the expression of crucial cardiac genes like GATA4, influencing the development of CHD. This suggests a mechanistic link between BRG1 expression and CHD, supporting the initial statement about correlation but framing it within the context of a pathological decrease in expression rather than just a correlation.

In summary, while the abstract supports the notion that BRG1 expression correlates with CHD, it specifically highlights that decreased BRG1 expression (and its regulatory methylation changes) is associated with the pathogenesis of CHD, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of how BRG1 expression relates to CHD."	BRG1, an ATPase subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex, is tightly associated with cardiac development. However, little is known about the association between the pathogenesis of CHD and BRG1. The methylation of a BRG1 promoter and a novel CpG island in the second intron was analyzed in the myocardium of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients (n = 24) and normal controls (n = 11) using pyrosequencing and the MassARRAY platform. BRG1 expression was sketched in the normal fetal and postnatal heart using real-time PCR. BRG1 mRNA and protein expression was detected by means of real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The expression of GATA4 was analyzed with real-time PCR. The CpG shore in the second intron of BRG1 was hypomethylated in the myocardium of patients (p < 0.05). BRG1 showed a high level of expression in the normal fetal heart in the second trimester (p < 0.01). Compared with that of the normal subjects, BRG1 expression was decreased by 70% in the myocardium of patients (n = 92; p < 0.05). Of note, the expression of GATA4 was significantly correlated with BRG1 expression (r = 0.7475; p = 0.0082) in the myocardium, and it was also decreased by 70% in these patients (n = 92; p < 0.05). These results suggested that the early high expression of BRG1 in fetal hearts maintained normal cardiac development and that the abnormal hypomethylation and decreased expression of BRG1 in human hearts probably affect the expression of GATA4, which affects the pathogenesis of CHD.

5	31606405	Mutations in ADIPOQ contribute to Cystic Fibrosis	ADIPOQ	Cystic Fibrosis	0	"The abstract does not support the statement that mutations in ADIPOQ contribute to cystic fibrosis (CF). Here's why:

1. **Study Focus and Methods**: The study was focused on analyzing the role of ADIPOQ (and STATH) genes as potential modifier genes that could affect the clinical variability in CF. The researchers examined exons and exon/intron junctions in these genes for variations that could be linked to differences in CF disease severity among patients.

2. **Results and Findings**: The key finding from the study was the absence of rare genetic variants in the ADIPOQ gene that could be associated with the clinical variability in CF. This explicitly states that, based on their analysis, there is no evidence of a genetic contribution from ADIPOQ to CF variability or severity.

3. **Conclusion**: The conclusion drawn from the study is clear in stating that ADIPOQ (and STATH) genes are not associated with phenotypic modulation of CF in the studied population. This directly contradicts the statement that mutations in ADIPOQ contribute to CF, as the study found no link between ADIPOQ gene variants and CF disease characteristics.

4. **Implications for Further Research**: The researchers suggest that their findings help refine the direction of future research by indicating that financial resources and efforts might be better spent studying other genes or factors. This reinforces the conclusion that ADIPOQ does not play a role in CF as per their findings.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence against the hypothesis that mutations in ADIPOQ are contributing factors to cystic fibrosis, showing instead that there is no association between ADIPOQ genetic variants and CF phenotypic variability."	The phenotypic variability in cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely recognized and modulated by environmental and genetic factors, including CFTR pathogenic variants and modifier genes genetic variants. In this context, determining the presence of variants in genes involved in immune response may allow a better understanding of CF variability, mainly in lung disease. Thus, ADIPOQ and STATH genes were selected and the analysis of exons and exon/intron junctions was performed for the determination of variations in its sequence, to determine the possible genetic modulation. A total of 49 patients with CF, diagnosed for showing abnormal [chloride] levels in the sweat test, and identification of two pathogenic variants in CFTR categorized as class I and II were included. Genetic sequencing was performed for the identification of variants in the modifier genes. In our analysis, there was absence of rare genetic variants in STATH and ADIPOQ genes associated with the clinical variability. Thus, we are not able to establish an association between the disease severity and rare genetic variants in STATH and ADIPOQ genes, considering exons and exon/intron junctions. Considering the negative screening for rare genetic variants in ADIPOQ and STATH genes, it may be concluded that these genes are not associated with phenotypic modulation of CF in our population. To understand the modifier genes and its action at CF variability it is essential to promote a better overview of the disease. Also, negative reports can help to direct new studies without the use of unnecessary financial support.
6	23765216	Ibruprofen can be used to treat lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis	Ibruprofen	Lung disease (in patients with cystic fibrosis)	1	"The abstract supports the statement that ibuprofen can be used to treat lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Here’s how the abstract substantiates this claim:

1. **Study Purpose and Design**: The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in treating CF. The study was methodologically rigorous, involving randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral NSAIDs to placebo in CF patients.

2. **Specific Focus on Ibuprofen**: Among the NSAIDs tested, ibuprofen was specifically evaluated in three trials. The methodological quality of these trials was considered good or adequate, and they focused on various outcomes relevant to lung disease in CF.

3. **Positive Outcomes Associated with Ibuprofen**: The combined data from the two largest trials on ibuprofen showed a significant benefit in slowing the annual rate of decline in lung function parameters such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow (25-75%). This suggests that ibuprofen helps maintain lung function over time in CF patients.

4. **Benefits in Younger Children**: The post-hoc analysis split by age revealed that younger children taking ibuprofen experienced a statistically significant slower rate of annual decline in lung function (% predicted FEV1 and FVC), indicating a particularly beneficial effect of ibuprofen in this subgroup.

5. **Additional Benefits**: In one of the trials, long-term use of high-dose ibuprofen was linked not only to reduced lung function decline but also to decreased need for intravenous antibiotics, and improvements in nutritional and radiological assessments of pulmonary status. These outcomes indicate a broader therapeutic effect of ibuprofen in managing CF-related lung disease.

6. **Safety Profile**: The trials reported no major adverse effects associated with ibuprofen use, although it was noted that the power to detect clinically important differences in adverse effects was low. This suggests that ibuprofen, at least within the context of the trials, was relatively safe for use in CF patients.

7. **Authors’ Conclusions**: The conclusion drawn from the study was that high-dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in CF patients, particularly in children. This aligns with the initial aim to explore NSAIDs as a treatment to prevent progressive pulmonary deterioration in CF.

Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence supporting the use of ibuprofen as an effective treatment option to manage and slow the progression of lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly highlighting its efficacy in younger patients."	Progressive lung damage causes most deaths in cystic fibrosis (CF). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent progressive pulmonary deterioration and morbidity in CF. To assess the effectiveness of treatment with NSAIDs in CF. We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted manufacturers of NSAIDs.Latest search of the Group's Trials Register: 15 May 2013. Randomized controlled trials comparing oral NSAIDs, at any dose for at least two months, to placebo in people with CF. Two authors independently assessed trials for the review. The searches identified eight trials; five are included (334 participants aged five to 39 years; maximum follow up of four years). Three trials compared ibuprofen to placebo (two from the same centre with some of the same participants); one trial assessed piroxicam versus placebo, a fifth trial compared cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor nimesulide and clarithromycin. The three ibuprofen trials were deemed to have good or adequate methodological quality, but used various outcomes and summary measures. Reviewers considered measures of lung function, nutritional status, radiological assessment of pulmonary involvement, intravenous antibiotic usage, hospital admissions, survival and adverse effects. Combined data from the two largest ibuprofen trials showed a significantly lower annual rate of decline for lung function, % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) mean difference (MD) 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.42); forced vital capacity (FVC) MD 1.27 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.28); forced expiratory flow (25-75%) MD 1.80 (95% CI 0.15 to 3.45). The post-hoc analysis of data from two trials split by age showed a statistically significant slower rate of annual decline of % predicted FEV1 and FVC in the ibuprofen group in younger children, MD 1.41% (95% CI 0.03 to 2.80) and MD 1.32% (95% CI 0.04 to 2.60) respectively. In one trial, long-term use of high-dose ibuprofen was associated with reduced intravenous antibiotic usage, improved nutritional and radiological pulmonary status. No major adverse effects were reported, but the power of the trials to identify clinically important differences in the incidence of adverse effects was low. High-dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in people with CF, especially in children, which suggests that strategies to modulate lung inflammation can be beneficial for people with CF.
7	23242296	A mutation in APOE contributes to Down Syndrome	APOE	Down Syndrome	0	"The abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in APOE contributes to Down Syndrome. Here's the breakdown of the information provided and how it relates to the statement:

1. **Background and Objective**: The study investigates APOE gene polymorphisms in individuals with Down Syndrome, their parents, and controls. APOEε4 is specifically noted for its association with Alzheimer's disease, which is a common co-morbidity in older individuals with Down Syndrome. The objective was to explore whether there's a genetic association between APOE polymorphisms and Down Syndrome itself.

2. **Methodology**: The study used RFLP-PCR to analyze APOE gene polymorphisms in a sample of young individuals with Down Syndrome, their parents, and healthy controls.

3. **Results**: The most common allele in all groups was APOEε3, and the APOEε3/ε3 genotype was the most frequent genotype observed. The APOEε4 allele was found to be slightly more frequent in individuals with Down Syndrome (11%) compared to controls (9%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, no significant differences were found in the allelic or genotypic frequencies when comparing the Down Syndrome group and their parents to the controls.

4. **Conclusions**: The study concludes that there is no statistically significant association between APOE polymorphisms and Down Syndrome. The slight differences observed might be influenced by sample size or ethnic background, suggesting that the findings are not robust enough to establish a link between APOE mutations and the occurrence of Down Syndrome.

5. **Further Research**: The abstract mentions the need for more studies, particularly to explore potential associations with Alzheimer's disease in other Colombian populations. This suggests that while APOE may be of interest in studying Alzheimer's disease in the context of Down Syndrome, it does not contribute directly to the genetic basis of Down Syndrome itself.

In summary, based on the results and conclusions of this study, there is no evidence to support the statement that a mutation in APOE contributes to Down Syndrome. Instead, the study finds no significant genetic association between APOE polymorphisms and the condition."	Introduction.Gene APOEε4 allele polymorphisms have been examined in Down syndrome because of the relationship between (a) the E4 isoform and (b) the type of Alzheimer's dementia that appears in individuals with Down syndrome. This isoform is considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease development and has been associated with early death in Down syndrome. Objectives. The polymorphisms in the APOE gene were characterized for Down syndrome individuals and their parents, in order to detect associations between the APOE polymorphisms and Down syndrome. Materials and methods. APOE gene polymorphisms were detected by RFLP-PCR and analyzed in 134 young individuals with Down syndrome, 87 mothers and 54 fathers, residents of the departments of Quindío and Risaralda, Colombia. The controls were 525 healthy individuals. Results. The APOEε3 allele and ε3/ε3 genotype were most frequent in all the populations (83-90% and 70-78%). The allelic frequency of APOEε2 was very low and ε2/ε2 (3-7%) was absent in Down syndrome and their parents. The allele APOEε4 was more frequent (11% vs. 9%) in Down syndrome individuals than in the controls. Comparing the allelic and genotypic frequencies between the populations with Down syndrome and their parents with the controls using Pearson c2 test and Fisher's exact test odds ratio, no statistically significant differences were found. Conclusions. No statistically significant association was found between the polymorphisms of the APOE gene and Down syndrome. Sample size or ethnic influences may have affected these results. More studies are necessary with other Colombian populations to determine possible associations in other genes related to Alzheimer's disease.
8	34151863	A mutation in GBA1 increases the likelihood of Parkinson's disease	GBA1	Parkinson's Disease	1	"The abstract strongly supports the statement that a mutation in GBA1 increases the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. Here’s a breakdown of the elements in the abstract that back this assertion:

1. **Lysosomal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease**: The abstract begins by highlighting the role of lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This sets the stage for discussing how specific genes related to lysosomal function impact PD.

2. **Role of GBA1**: It specifically points out that among lysosomal genes, GBA1 has the largest impact on Parkinson's disease risk. This direct statement underscores the importance of GBA1 in relation to PD.

3. **Mechanism of GBA1 Impact**: The abstract explains that a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is encoded by GBA1, leads to the accumulation of glycolipid substrates (glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine). This accumulation results in toxicity and inflammation, which adversely affect various clinical aspects of PD such as disease risk, severity, age of onset, and progression to dementia.

4. **Clinical Relevance of GBA1 Mutation**: The detailed description of how GBA1 mutations impact disease risk and progression in Parkinson's disease is significant. It indicates that mutations in GBA1 not only increase the likelihood of developing PD but also influence the clinical trajectory of the disease.

5. **Therapeutic Implications**: The abstract also discusses a therapeutic approach targeting GBA1 via gene therapy (PR001), which is designed to deliver a functional GBA1 gene to the brain. The mention of this therapy undergoing clinical trials for PD patients carrying GBA1 mutations further supports the critical role of GBA1 mutations in the disease. It implies that correcting the dysfunction caused by GBA1 mutations could potentially slow or stop the progression of PD.

6. **Conclusion on GBA1 and PD**: The assertion that re-establishing normal GCase enzyme activity might reduce the progression of PD in patients with GBA1 mutations is a strong indicator of the gene's impact on the disease.

Overall, the abstract provides comprehensive evidence that mutations in GBA1 are a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease, affecting its onset, severity, and progression. This directly supports the statement regarding the increased likelihood of PD with GBA1 mutations."	Human genetic studies as well as studies in animal models indicate that lysosomal dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Among the lysosomal genes involved, GBA1 has the largest impact on Parkinson's disease risk. Deficiency in the GBA1 encoded enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) leads to the accumulation of the GCase glycolipid substrates glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine and ultimately results in toxicity and inflammation and negatively affect many clinical aspects of Parkinson's disease, including disease risk, the severity of presentation, age of onset, and likelihood of progression to dementia. These findings support the view that re-establishing normal levels of GCase enzyme activity may reduce the progression of Parkinson's disease in patients carrying GBA1 mutations. Studies in mouse models indicate that PR001, a AAV9 vector-based gene therapy designed to deliver a functional GBA1 gene to the brain, suggest that this therapeutic approach may slow or stop disease progression. PR001 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials with Parkinson's disease patients carrying GBA1 mutations.
9	25611507	A mutation in PINK1 has no affect to the likelihood of Parkinson's disease	PINK1	Parkinson's Disease	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in PINK1 has no effect on the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. Instead, the abstract suggests the opposite, highlighting the significant role PINK1 plays in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Here's how the abstract informs this understanding:

1. **Role of PINK1 in Parkinson's Disease**: The abstract specifically discusses the function of genes like PINK1 in hereditary forms of Parkinson's disease, suggesting its importance in understanding the disease's etiology. PINK1 is mentioned as one of the genes mutated in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, indicating a direct link to the disease.

2. **Pathway Involvement**: The abstract explains how PINK1 and Parkin, another gene associated with Parkinson's disease, work together in a specific biochemical pathway involved in mitochondrial quality control. This pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular health, and disruptions in this pathway due to mutations can lead to disease.

3. **Mechanism of Action**: PINK1's specific role involves accumulating on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, activating Parkin, and recruiting it to dysfunctional mitochondria to initiate a process known as selective autophagy. This process is vital for removing damaged mitochondria from cells, preventing potential cell damage and death that contributes to Parkinson's disease.

4. **Implications of PINK1 Loss**: The review covers the consequences of losing normal PINK1 function, which include impairments in mitochondrial quality control. This impairment is implicated in the development of Parkinson's disease, further underscoring the importance of PINK1 in the disease process.

5. **Association with Parkinson's Disease**: The involvement of PINK1 in key pathways and mechanisms that directly relate to Parkinson's disease pathology indicates that mutations in this gene do affect the likelihood of developing the disease. It specifically contributes to forms of parkinsonism, emphasizing its role in disease susceptibility.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence that mutations in PINK1 are linked to mechanisms that lead to Parkinson's disease, particularly through its role in mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular damage pathways. This evidence directly contradicts the statement that a mutation in PINK1 has no effect on the likelihood of Parkinson's disease, indicating instead that such mutations are indeed significant in the disease's development."	Understanding the function of genes mutated in hereditary forms of Parkinson's disease yields insight into disease etiology and reveals new pathways in cell biology. Although mutations or variants in many genes increase the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, only a handful of monogenic causes of parkinsonism have been identified. Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the products of two genes that are mutated in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, PINK1 and Parkin, normally work together in the same pathway to govern mitochondrial quality control, bolstering previous evidence that mitochondrial damage is involved in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, activates Parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and recruits Parkin to the dysfunctional mitochondrion. Then, Parkin ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to trigger selective autophagy. This review covers the normal functions that PINK1 and Parkin play within cells, their molecular mechanisms of action, and the pathophysiological consequences of their loss.
10	28974385	Nitazoxanide is a proven treatment for rubella virus	Nitazoxanide	Rubella virus	0	"The abstract does not fully support the statement that Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a proven treatment for rubella virus. While it suggests promising results and potential application, it clearly indicates that further studies are required to establish NTZ as a definitive treatment for rubella virus infections. Here's a breakdown of the information provided and its implications:

1. **Context and Need**: The abstract begins by acknowledging the absence of existing drugs to treat rubella virus (RV) infections, which sets the stage for the need for new therapeutic options like NTZ.

2. **Empirical Treatment Results**: NTZ was given empirically for two months to a patient with primary immune deficiency (PID) who had RV-positive cutaneous granulomas. The treatment was associated with a decline or elimination of RV antigen from the lesions, suggesting effectiveness in this particular clinical context. However, this is a single case, and thus, while suggestive, it is not conclusive evidence of general efficacy.

3. **In Vitro Studies**: NTZ was shown to significantly inhibit RV replication in various cell culture models, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells and epithelial cell lines. It demonstrated a dose-dependent effect with a relatively low inhibitory concentration. This provides strong preliminary evidence that NTZ has antiviral activity against RV in vitro.

4. **Mechanism of Action**: The abstract details NTZ’s mechanism of action, noting that it affects both early and late stages of RV infection. This includes inhibiting the synthesis of both cellular and viral RNA and interfering with the trafficking of RV surface glycoproteins. Understanding the mechanism enhances the credibility of NTZ as a potential antiviral agent against RV.

5. **Caveat and Conclusion**: Despite these promising findings, the abstract concludes by stating that ""more studies are required"" to establish NTZ as a treatment for persistent rubella infections. This caution suggests that while NTZ shows potential, it has not yet been proven effective as a standard treatment for rubella virus infections across a broader population.

In summary, while the abstract provides initial evidence suggesting that NTZ could be effective against rubella virus, particularly in vitro and in a specific clinical case, it does not assert that NTZ is a proven, broadly validated treatment for rubella virus. Further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in a larger, more diverse population."	Persistent rubella virus (RV) infection has been associated with various pathologies such as congenital rubella syndrome, Fuchs's uveitis, and cutaneous granulomas in patients with primary immune deficiencies (PID). Currently there are no drugs to treat RV infections. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA-approved drug for parasitic infections, and has been recently shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we found that empiric 2-month therapy with oral NTZ was associated in the decline/elimination of RV antigen from lesions in a PID patient with RV positive granulomas, while peginterferon treatment had no effect. In addition, we characterized the effects of NTZ on cell culture models of persistent RV infection. NTZ significantly inhibited RV replication in a primary culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Vero and A549 epithelial cell lines in a dose dependent manner with an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.35 μg/ml (1.1 μM). RV strains representing currently circulating genotypes were inhibited to a similar extent. NTZ affected early and late stages of infection by inhibiting synthesis of cellular and RV RNA and interfering with intracellular trafficking of the RV surface glycoproteins, E1 and E2. These results suggest a potential application of NTZ for the treatment of persistent rubella infections, but more studies are required.
11	25387188	Penicillin is proven to be an effective treatment for syphillis	Penicillin	Syphillis	1	"The abstract strongly supports the statement that penicillin is proven to be an effective treatment for syphilis. Here’s how the abstract underlines this:

1. **Extensive Review**: The abstract describes a comprehensive review of the literature from 1965 until July 2014, including randomized trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies, which provides a robust evidence base for evaluating treatment regimens for syphilis.

2. **Specific Findings on Penicillin**: It specifically highlights that data from studies involving 11,102 patients reviewed penicillin and non-penicillin regimens. For early syphilis, it mentions the effectiveness of a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G, with treatment success rates reported between 90% to 100%.

3. **Treatment Success and Serological Response**: The abstract discusses the high success rates of penicillin treatment and the expected serological response, noting that nontreponemal serologic titers should decline following treatment, although some patients may remain seropositive in what is known as the ""serofast state."" This indicates that while the serological response can be complex, the initial effectiveness of penicillin is well-documented.

4. **Considerations for Special Populations**: While stating that the evidence is limited for specific populations like HIV-infected individuals and pregnant women, the abstract still supports penicillin as the first-line therapy, indicating its broad applicability and the trust placed in it as an effective treatment across different patient groups.

5. **Conclusion and Relevance**: The conclusion that penicillin G remains the mainstay of syphilis treatment emphasizes its established role despite modest clinical trial data. This statement encapsulates the consensus in the medical community about penicillin’s efficacy based on longstanding use and supportive evidence from numerous studies.

In summary, the abstract not only supports the statement that penicillin is an effective treatment for syphilis but also details its use, effectiveness, and the nature of evidence that backs its continued use as the primary treatment option for this infection."	"The incidence of syphilis in the United States is increasing; it is estimated that more than 55,000 new infections will occur in 2014. Treatment regimens are controversial, especially in specific populations, and assessing treatment response based on serology remains a challenge. To review evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens, implications of the ""serofast state,"" and treatment of specific populations including those with neurosyphilis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pregnant women. We searched MEDLINE for English-language human treatment studies dating from January 1965 until July 2014. The American Heart Association classification system was used to rate quality of evidence. We included 102 articles in our review, consisting of randomized trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies. Case reports and small series were excluded unless they were the only studies providing evidence for a specific treatment strategy. We included 11 randomized trials. Evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens was reviewed from studies involving 11,102 patients. Data on the treatment of early syphilis support the use of a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million U of benzathine penicillin G, with studies reporting 90% to 100% treatment success rates. The value of multiple-dose treatment of early syphilis is uncertain, especially in HIV-infected individuals. Less evidence is available regarding therapy for late and late latent syphilis. Following treatment, nontreponemal serologic titers should decline in a stable pattern, but a significant proportion of patients may remain seropositive (the ""serofast state""). Serologic response to treatment should be evident by 6 months in early syphilis but is generally slower (12-24 months) for latent syphilis. Evidence defining treatment for HIV-infected persons and for pregnant women is limited, but available data support penicillin as first-line therapy. The mainstay of syphilis treatment is parenteral penicillin G despite the relatively modest clinical trial data that support its use."
12	38007504	A mutation in A1BG affects resistance to Adriamycin	A1BG	Adriamycin	0	"The abstract does not directly support the statement that a mutation in A1BG affects resistance to Adriamycin (ADR), primarily because it does not discuss mutations in the A1BG gene itself. Instead, the abstract focuses on the role of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) known as A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1), which is related to but distinct from the A1BG gene. Here’s how the abstract relates to ADR resistance:

1. **Focus on A1BG-AS1**: The study centers on A1BG-AS1, an lncRNA that is upregulated in ADR-resistant breast cancer (BC) cell lines. While A1BG-AS1 is related to the A1BG gene, it functions as an RNA molecule rather than as a protein encoded by the A1BG gene itself.

2. **Mechanism of ADR Resistance**: The abstract explains that A1BG-AS1 enhances ADR resistance by positively regulating the expression of ABCB1, a gene known to be involved in drug resistance in cancer cells. This regulation occurs through the interaction with IGF2BP2, an m6A reader that stabilizes mRNA transcripts, including ABCB1's mRNA, in an m6A-dependent manner.

3. **Experimental Findings**: Key findings include that knockdown of A1BG-AS1 enhanced ADR sensitivity in BC cells, reduced their viability, proliferation, and migration, and facilitated apoptosis. Additionally, A1BG-AS1 silencing in xenograft mouse models inhibited tumor growth and alleviated ADR resistance.

4. **Implication of A1BG Gene**: Although the study involves an antisense RNA related to the A1BG gene, it does not address mutations in the A1BG gene itself or their direct impact on ADR resistance. The role described is specific to the antisense RNA (A1BG-AS1) and its regulation of another gene (ABCB1) involved in drug resistance.

5. **Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that A1BG-AS1, through its interaction with IGF2BP2, upregulates ABCB1, thereby enhancing ADR resistance in BC. This specific mechanism does not imply that mutations in the A1BG gene itself affect ADR resistance.

In summary, while the abstract demonstrates that A1BG-AS1 plays a significant role in mediating ADR resistance in breast cancer through the regulation of ABCB1 expression, it does not support the statement regarding mutations in the A1BG gene affecting ADR resistance. The focus is rather on the function of the antisense RNA and its impact on drug resistance mechanisms."	Adriamycin (ADR) resistance is an obstacle for chemotherapy of breast cancer (BC). ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) expression is indicated to be closely related to the drug resistance of cancer cells. The current work intended to explore the molecular mechanisms to regulate ABCB1 in BC cells with ADR resistance. We found that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) is upregulated in ADR resistant BC cell lines (MCF-7/ADR, MDA-MB-231/ADR). A1BG-AS1 knockdown enhanced the ADR sensitivity by suppressing the viability, proliferation potential and migration ability, and facilitating cell apoptosis in BC. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is known to be an m6A reader to modulate the stability of mRNA transcripts in an m6A-dependent manner, which was a shared RNA binding protein (RBP) for A1BG-AS1 and ABCB1. The interaction of IGF2BP2 with A1BG-AS1 or ABCB1 was explored and verified using RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. ABCB1 mRNA and protein expression was positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 and IGF2BP2 in BC cells. ABCB1 mRNA expression was stabilized by A1BG-AS1 via recruiting IGF2BP2 in an m6A-dependent manner. Moreover, rescue assays demonstrated that A1BG-AS1 enhanced BC ADR resistance by positively modulating ABCB1. Xenograft mouse models were used to explore whether A1BG-AS1 affected the ADR resistance in BC in vivo. The findings indicated that A1BG-AS1 silencing inhibited tumor growth and alleviated ADR resistance in vivo. In conclusion, A1BG-AS1 enhances the ADR resistance of BC by recruiting IGF2BP2 to upregulate ABCB1 in an m6A-dependent manner.
13	37649161	A mutation in APOO can lead to mitochondrial disease	APOO	Mitochondrial Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in APOO can lead to mitochondrial disease. The evidence provided in the abstract directly links a specific mutation in the APOO/MIC26 gene to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and associated clinical phenotypes in two patients. Here's how the abstract supports this claim:

1. **Identification of Mutation**: The abstract reports a novel variant in the APOO/MIC26 gene, specifically a nonsense mutation (c.532G>T; p.E178*) that results in the premature truncation of the MIC26 protein. This truncation leads to the loss of 20 C-terminal amino acids, crucial for the protein's stability and function.

2. **Functional Impact of Mutation**: The mutation causes the MIC26 protein to become highly unstable and prone to degradation. Although the truncated MIC26 protein can still localize to mitochondria and interact with other subunits of the MICOS complex, its functionality is severely impaired.

3. **Mitochondrial Morphology and Function**: Cells expressing the mutant MIC26 show significant mitochondrial defects, including perturbed cristae architecture and fragmented mitochondrial morphology. These cellular abnormalities are consistent with those observed in MIC26 knockout (KO) cells, indicating that the mutation effectively mimics a knockout situation.

4. **Clinical Manifestations**: The two patients with this mutation developed severe mitochondrial disease characterized by a spectrum of serious clinical manifestations, including progeria-like phenotypes, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral congenital cataracts, hypothyroidism, and severe immune deficiencies. Both patients died at an early age (12 and 18 months), underscoring the mutation's severe impact.

5. **Conclusion of Loss-of-Function**: The study concludes that the mutation is a loss-of-function mutation that impairs mitochondrial morphology and cristae morphogenesis. This dysfunctional mitochondrial structure and function directly contribute to the observed disease phenotypes.

Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that mutations in the APOO/MIC26 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disease through disruptions in mitochondrial structure and function, thereby validating the statement that a mutation in APOO can lead to mitochondrial disease."	APOO/MIC26 is a subunit of the MICOS complex required for mitochondrial cristae morphology and function. Here, we report a novel variant of the APOO/MIC26 gene that causes a severe mitochondrial disease with overall progeria-like phenotypes in two patients. Both patients developed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral congenital cataract, hypothyroidism, and severe immune deficiencies. The patients died at an early age of 12 or 18 months. Exome sequencing revealed a mutation (NM_024122.5): c.532G>T (p.E178*) in the APOO/MIC26 gene that causes a nonsense mutation leading to the loss of 20 C-terminal amino acids. This mutation resulted in a highly unstable and degradation prone MIC26 protein, yet the remaining minute amounts of mutant MIC26 correctly localized to mitochondria and interacted physically with other MICOS subunits. MIC26 KO cells expressing MIC26 harboring the respective APOO/MIC26 mutation showed mitochondria with perturbed cristae architecture and fragmented morphology resembling MIC26 KO cells. We conclude that the novel mutation found in the APOO/MIC26 gene is a loss-of-function mutation impairing mitochondrial morphology and cristae morphogenesis.
14	29432786	Increased estrogen decreases APOO transcription	Estrogen	APOO	0	"The abstract does not support the statement that increased estrogen decreases APOO transcription. Instead, it indicates the opposite effect, where estrogen treatment actually increases ApoO expression. Here's a breakdown of how the abstract's content relates to the statement:

1. **Experimental Setup**: The study involved comparing the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells and human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Various treatments were applied, including incubation with oleic acid and estrogen, to observe the effects on ApoO expression.

2. **Effects of Estrogen**: The abstract specifically states that upon treatment with estrogen for 24 hours, quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein levels showed increases in ApoO expression. This clearly indicates that estrogen stimulates, rather than decreases, the transcription and expression of ApoO.

3. **Context of Estrogen’s Effect**: The increase in ApoO expression upon estrogen treatment is consistent with the role of estrogen in affecting lipoprotein metabolism, suggesting that estrogen may have a regulatory effect on genes involved in lipid handling and mitochondrial function, which are important in conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

4. **Overall Findings**: The study concludes that ApoO may play a role in mitochondrial function potentially impacted by NAFLD. The observed increase in ApoO expression with estrogen treatment aligns with its postulated role in managing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial integrity.

In summary, the abstract directly contradicts the statement that increased estrogen decreases APOO transcription, demonstrating instead that estrogen exposure leads to an increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels. This suggests a regulatory mechanism where estrogen positively influences ApoO expression, which could be part of broader metabolic adjustments mediated by estrogen."	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is marked by hepatic fat accumulation and reflects a spectrum of chronic liver diseases associated with obesity, impaired insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia. Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the plasma apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and electron transport activity of the mitochondrium. However, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Based on our previous data in a non-mammalian experimental system [1], we hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones and oxidative stress. To gain insight into a mammalian experimental system, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells with those in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Incubation of the cells with BSA-complexed oleic acid (OA-Alb) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with in-house produced rabbit anti-ApoO antisera demonstrated significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. ROS formation due to OA-Alb treatment was only slightly altered in LMH cells, indicating an intact antioxidant defense system of the cells. Oxidative stress applied by addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> revealed induction of ApoO transcript and protein level in the same or even higher extent as monitored in the presence of OA-Alb. Upon treatment with estrogen for 24 h quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein revealed increases of ApoO expression supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism at various points. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA-Alb. Therefore, we assume that our findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
15	29372117	Expression of APPAT plays no role in the development of atherosclerosis	APPAT	Atherosclerosis	0	"The abstract does not support the statement that ""Expression of APPAT plays no role in the development of atherosclerosis."" Instead, it provides evidence that APPAT may indeed play a significant role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Here's how the abstract supports APPAT's involvement:

1. **Identification and Evaluation of APPAT**: The abstract discusses the identification of a new circulating long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) called APPAT, specifically associated with atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis. The study focuses on evaluating APPAT's role in atherosclerosis and its potential as a biomarker.

2. **Expression Patterns and Localization**: APPAT was examined for its expression in vitro (in cell culture models) and in vivo (in human samples), with its distribution and subcellular location determined using immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH). This detailed examination helps in understanding the functional contexts in which APPAT operates, particularly noting that it is enriched in contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the artery tunica media and primarily exists in the cytoplasm.

3. **Alterations in Disease States**: The study found that APPAT expression was significantly down-regulated in coronary artery samples with severe stenosis and also in blood samples from patients as the disease progressed (from healthy individuals to those with angina pectoris or myocardial infarction). This trend of decreased APPAT expression correlating with worsening atherosclerotic condition strongly suggests a functional role in the disease's pathogenesis.

4. **Predictive Capability**: The abstract mentions that the study explored APPAT's ability to predict the risk of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and correlation analyses verifying its relatively high predictive ability. This predictive utility further underscores the biological relevance of APPAT in atherosclerosis.

5. **Interaction with miRNAs**: The study also investigated the microRNA targets of APPAT, finding that the expression of a predicted miRNA target exhibited an opposite direction to that of APPAT. This interaction suggests a regulatory network involving APPAT that could impact cellular functions relevant to atherosclerosis.

6. **Conclusion**: The study concludes that APPAT likely performs an important function in the development of atherosclerosis, based on its expression patterns, regulatory interactions, and changes observed in pathological states.

In summary, the abstract provides substantial evidence that APPAT is functionally involved in atherosclerosis, contradicting the statement that it plays no role. The findings suggest that APPAT has both a mechanistic role in the disease and potential utility as a biomarker for its progression."	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to modulate cardiovascular diseases, and expression dynamics of lncRNAs in the bloodstream were proposed to be potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. However, few cardiovascular diseases-related circulating lncRNAs were identified and their prediction power has not been investigated in depth. Here we report a new circulating lncRNA, <i>atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis associated transcript</i> (<i>APPAT</i>), and evaluated its role and predicting ability in atherosclerotic development. <i>APPAT</i> was analyzed and screened by high-throughput sequencing, and then detected <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH) was utilized to explore distribution and subcellular location of <i>APPAT</i>. The expressing alteration of <i>APPAT</i> in samples of healthy and pathological coronary artery was explored further. We also assessed the level of circulating <i>APPAT</i> in blood samples from healthy individuals, and patients with angina pectoris (AP) or myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, we predicted and validated microRNA targets of <i>APPAT</i>, then showed the expression level of a candidate target which was primarily measured in human VSMCs cell line, coronary artery, and blood samples. Lastly, we examined the potential indicating ability of <i>APPAT</i> for the risk of AP or MI. <i>APPAT</i> showed significant reduction in ox-LDL treated human VSMCs <i>in vitro</i>. It enriched in contractile VSMCs of artery tunica media and mainly existed in cytoplasm. Significant down-regulation of <i>APPAT</i> was found in coronary artery samples with severe stenosis. More importantly, we observed decreased expression of <i>APPAT</i> in blood samples accompanying disease progression. ROC and correlation analyses further verified the relatively high predicting ability of <i>APPAT</i>. We also observed the predicted miRNA exhibited opposite expression direction to that of <i>APPAT</i>. This study revealed that circulating lncRNA-<i>APPAT</i> may perform an important function and have some indicating ability on the development of atherosclerosis.
16	23200920	Mutations in TLR4 contribute to the risk of tuberculosis	TLR4	Tuberculosis	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in TLR4 contribute to the risk of tuberculosis. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract addresses this topic:

1. **Objective and Background**: The study aims to determine whether polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene affect susceptibility to tuberculosis. TLR4 is recognized as playing an important role in immunity against the tubercle bacillus, which suggests a potential genetic influence on tuberculosis risk. 

2. **Meta-analysis Approach**: The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis, integrating data from previously published studies to provide more reliable estimates regarding the association between TLR4 gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis risk.

3. **Methods**: They systematically searched the literature and included six case-control studies in their meta-analysis, involving a total of 1587 controls and 2110 patients. This approach enhances the reliability of the findings due to the systematic method and the relatively large sample size.

4. **Results**: The results showed no significant association between two specific polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) and the risk of developing tuberculosis. Various genetic models were analyzed (codominant, dominant, recessive, and allele models), and none showed statistically significant associations, as indicated by the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the meta-analysis, the study concludes that these TLR4 gene polymorphisms do not contribute to susceptibility to tuberculosis. This conclusion is supported by the statistical analysis across different genetic models, reinforcing the reliability of the finding.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence against the statement that mutations in TLR4 contribute to the risk of tuberculosis, clearly stating that the examined TLR4 polymorphisms do not affect the susceptibility to this disease according to the analyzed data."	Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a vital role in immunity to tubercle bacillus and its gene polymorphisms are supposed to affect tuberculosis susceptibility in some rather than all studies. Then, we integrated published data and performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to get more reliable estimations for the strength of associations between TLR4 gene polymorphisms and the risk of tuberculosis. We systematically searched the electronic PubMed database for research articles about TLR4 gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis up to February 2012. Revman 5.0 software was adopted to conduct the meta-analysis. Crude odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by either fixed-effects model or random-effects model. Finally, six case-control studies were identified, involving 1587 controls and 2110 patients. Overall, no significant associations were found between TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism and tuberculosis in the codominant models (GG vs AA: OR=1.56, 95% CI=0.76-3.21, P=0.23; GA vs AA: OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.84-1.23, P=0.89), the dominant model (GG+GA vs AA: OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.80-1.35, P=0.75), the recessive model (GG vs GA+AA: OR=1.55, 95% CI=0.75-3.19, P=0.24) and the allele model (G vs A: OR=1.06, 95% CI=0.81-1.40, P=0.66). Similarly, no significant associations between TLR4 gene Thr399Ile and tuberculosis were observed (all P>0.05). The present meta-analysis suggests that TLR4 gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms are not associated with the susceptibility of tuberculosis.
17	33753877	Mutations in MASP2 are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis	MASP2	tuberculosis	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that mutations in MASP2 are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). Here are the key points from the abstract that underpin this support:

1. **Study Objective and Design**: The study was designed to investigate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MASP2 gene and susceptibility to TB, as well as the interaction of these SNPs with tea drinking. The use of a large sample size (503 patients and 494 healthy controls) and specific SNPs (rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659) adds robustness to the study's findings.

2. **Genotyping and Statistical Analysis**: Three SNPs in the MASP2 gene were genotyped, and the association with TB susceptibility was analyzed using multivariate unconditional logistic regression, a method suited for identifying and quantifying the strength of associations between gene variants and disease.

3. **Findings on MASP2 SNPs**: The results indicated that certain genotypes at two of the SNPs studied (AC + AA at rs12711521 and GT + GG at rs7548659) were more prevalent in the TB patient group compared to the healthy control group. The odds ratios (ORs) reported (1.423 and 1.439, respectively, with P < 0.05) demonstrate a statistically significant association between these MASP2 gene variants and increased susceptibility to TB.

4. **Gene-Lifestyle Interaction**: The study also explored the interaction between tea drinking and the MASP2 SNPs. While the interaction terms (Relative Excess Risk of Interaction, RERI) indicated negative interactions, suggesting that tea drinking might modify the effect of the SNPs on TB risk, this does not diminish the overall finding that the SNPs themselves are associated with TB.

5. **Conclusion and Implications**: The study concludes that specific SNPs in the MASP2 gene are associated with TB susceptibility. This conclusion is supported by statistically significant findings and suggests that these genetic variations in the MASP2 gene could influence the individual's risk of developing TB.

Overall, the abstract provides clear evidence that mutations (or polymorphisms) in the MASP2 gene are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis, supporting the initial statement regarding genetic susceptibility linked to MASP2."	Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) has been reported to play an important role as a key enzyme in the lectin pathway of the complement system. The objectives of our study were to determine whether the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of MASP2 and the gene-tea drinking interaction were associated with the susceptibility to TB. In total, 503 patients and 494 healthy controls were contained. Three SNPs (rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659) were genotyped. The association between the SNPs and susceptibility to TB were investigated by conducting multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis. The gene-tea drinking interactions were analyzed by the additive model of marginal structural linear odds models. Both genotype AC + AA at rs12711521 of MASP2 genes and genotype GT + GG at rs7548659 of MASP2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (OR: 1.423 and 1.439, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between tea drinking and rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659 of MASP2 genes was found to suggest negative interactions, which reached - 0.2311 (95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.4736, - 0.0113), - 0.7080 (95% CI - 1.3998, - 0.0163), and - 0.5140 (95% CI - 0.8988, - 0.1291), respectively (P < 0.05). Our finding indicated that the SNPs (rs12711521 and rs7548659) of MASP2 were associated with the susceptibility to TB. Furthermore, there were negative interactions between tea drinking and rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs75548659 of MASP2 gene, respectively. Our research provides a basis for studying the pathogenesis and prevention of tuberculosis.
18	23947898	Mutations in P2X7 have no relation to the susceptivbility of tuberculosis	P2X7	Tuberculosis	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in P2X7 have no relation to the susceptibility of tuberculosis (TB). On the contrary, the abstract provides clear evidence that the P2X7 receptor 1513 A>C (rs3751143) polymorphism is significantly associated with increased TB risk. Here's a detailed explanation of how the abstract contradicts the statement:

1. **Aim and Methodology**: The study aimed to clarify the association between the P2X7 1513 A>C polymorphism and TB risk through a meta-analysis, which pooled data from multiple case-control studies to overcome issues of scattered and inconsistent results and to increase statistical power.

2. **Meta-Analysis Findings**: The meta-analysis included a substantial number of participants, totaling 2710 controls and 2521 TB cases. The results from the analysis demonstrated a significant association between the C allele of the P2X7 1513 A>C polymorphism and increased risk of TB. This was evident across various genetic models:
   - **Allele Contrast (C vs. A)**: The presence of the C allele was associated with an increased risk of TB (OR=1.382, 95% CI=1.248-1.531, p=0.001).
   - **Homozygous Model (CC vs. AA)**: Homozygous carriers of the C allele had a significantly higher risk of TB (OR=1.676, 95% CI=1.251-2.247, p=0.001).
   - **Heterozygous Model (AC vs. AA)**: Individuals heterozygous for the C allele also showed increased TB risk (OR=1.429, 95% CI=1.260-1.621, p=0.001).
   - **Dominant and Recessive Models**: Both dominant and recessive genetic models indicated that the presence of the C allele (in homozygous or heterozygous form) increases TB susceptibility.

3. **Conclusion**: The meta-analysis concludes that the P2X7 1513 A>C polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to TB. This conclusion is robust, supported by significant p-values and confidence intervals across multiple genetic models.

4. **Implications for Future Research**: The study suggests the need for further well-designed epidemiological studies to validate these findings and possibly to explore the biological mechanisms underlying this association.

In summary, the abstract provides substantial evidence that mutations (specifically the 1513 A>C polymorphism) in the P2X7 gene are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis, directly contradicting the statement that there is no relation between P2X7 mutations and TB susceptibility."	Many case-control studies have been performed in the past to elucidate the association between the P2X7 receptor 1513 A>C (rs3751143) polymorphism and tuberculosis (TB) risk. However, their data interpretation was difficult due to scattered and inconsistent results that led to limited power. In this study, a quantitative summary assessment has been done through meta-analysis to appraise the association between the 1513 A>C polymorphism and TB susceptibility. Systematic assessment was performed for the published studies related with the association between the P2X7 1513 A>C polymorphism and TB risk retrieved from PubMed (Medline), EMBASE search. A meta-analysis was done using a statistical program to evaluate the said association. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for allele contrast, homozygous, heterozygous, dominant, and recessive genetic models. A total of 2710 controls and 2521 TB cases were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis results showed that C allele carrier status was significantly associated with increased TB risk (C vs. A: p=0.001; OR=1.382, 95% CI=1.248-1.531). Significant risk of TB was associated with the homozygous mutant CC (CC vs. AA: p=0.001; OR=1.676, 95% CI=1.251-2.247) and heterozygous AC (AC vs. AA: p=0.001; OR=1.429, 95% CI=1.260-1.621) comparisons. Similarly, dominant (CC vs. AA+AC: p=0.008; OR=1.481, 95% CI=1.109-1.978) and recessive (CC+AC vs. AA: p=0.001; OR=1.458, 95% CI=1.292-1.645) genetic models also revealed increased risk of developing TB. We found that the P2X7 1513 A>C gene polymorphism is significantly associated with increased susceptibility to TB. Also, future well-designed epidemiological studies with stratified case-control and biological characterization may be beneficial to validate these findings.
19	27720779	A mutation in MTHFR can lead to an increased likelihood of hypertension	MTHFR	Hypertension	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in MTHFR can lead to an increased likelihood of hypertension. Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Genetic Association Studies**: The abstract mentions that genome-wide association studies have identified a region near the MTHFR gene, which encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, as being associated with blood pressure. This finding implicates MTHFR in the regulation of blood pressure.

2. **Specific Polymorphism and Hypertension Risk**: It specifically points out the 677C→T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene and states that epidemiological studies have shown this polymorphism increases the risk of hypertension by 24-87% and cardiovascular disease by up to 40%. This clearly establishes a link between this MTHFR mutation and increased hypertension risk.

3. **Geographical Variation and Gene-Environment Interaction**: The abstract notes a large geographical variation in the risk associated with this polymorphism, suggesting the influence of gene-environment interactions. Emerging evidence indicates that riboflavin (vitamin B2), which is a cofactor for MTHFR, plays a role in this interaction, particularly affecting blood pressure in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype.

4. **Interventional Studies with Riboflavin**: Randomized trials have shown that targeted riboflavin supplementation in individuals homozygous for the MTHFR 677TT genotype significantly lowers systolic blood pressure by 6 to 13 mmHg. This intervention works independently of antihypertensive drugs and demonstrates that the hypertension phenotype associated with this polymorphism is modifiable.

5. **Clinical and Public Health Implications**: The ability to modulate blood pressure in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype through riboflavin supplementation has significant implications. It offers a non-drug treatment option for managing hypertension in these patients and suggests a potential preventive strategy in populations with a high prevalence of this genotype.

6. **Conclusion and Future Directions**: The abstract concludes that further investigation into this novel gene-nutrient interaction is necessary, especially in contexts like hypertension during pregnancy. This ongoing research underscores the importance of the MTHFR mutation in understanding and managing hypertension.

In summary, the abstract provides robust evidence supporting the association between the MTHFR 677C→T polymorphism and an increased likelihood of hypertension, highlighting both the genetic basis of this condition and the potential for targeted nutritional interventions to manage or prevent it."	Hypertension is the leading risk factor contributing to mortality worldwide, primarily from cardiovascular disease (CVD), while effective treatment of hypertension is proven to reduce CVD events. Along with the well recognized nutrition and lifestyle determinants, genetic factors are implicated in the development and progression of hypertension. In recent years genome-wide association studies have identified a region near the gene encoding the folate-metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) among eight loci associated with blood pressure. Epidemiological studies, which provide a separate line of evidence to link this gene with blood pressure, show that the 677C→T polymorphism in MTHFR increases the risk of hypertension by 24-87% and CVD by up to 40%, albeit with a large geographical variation in the extent of excess disease risk suggestive of a gene-environment interaction. Emerging evidence indicates that the relevant environmental factor may be riboflavin, the MTHFR co-factor, via a novel and genotype-specific effect on blood pressure. Randomized trials conducted in hypertensive patients (with and without overt CVD) pre-screened for this polymorphism show that targeted riboflavin supplementation in homozygous individuals (MTHFR 677TT genotype) lowers systolic blood pressure by 6 to 13 mmHg, independently of the effect of antihypertensive drugs. The latest evidence, that the blood pressure phenotype associated with this polymorphism is modifiable by riboflavin, has important clinical and public health implications. For hypertensive patients, riboflavin supplementation can offer a non-drug treatment to effectively lower blood pressure in those identified with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. For sub-populations worldwide with this genotype, better riboflavin status may prevent or delay the development of high blood pressure. Thus riboflavin, targeted at those homozygous for a common polymorphism in MTHFR, may offer a personalized treatment or preventative strategy for hypertension. Further investigations of this novel gene-nutrient interaction in relation to blood pressure, hypertension and hypertension in pregnancy are required.
20	30804141	Medication-related jaw osteonecrosis can be caused  by a mutation in ACE	Medication-related jaw osteonecrosis	ACE	0	"The biomedical abstract does not provide strong support for the statement that medication-related jaw osteonecrosis (MRONJ) can be directly caused by a mutation in the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) gene. Instead, the abstract describes a possible association between a genetic predisposition to hypertension (via the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene) and an increased risk of developing MRONJ in two patients. Here's a breakdown of how the abstract relates to the statement:

1. **Patient Descriptions and Treatments**: The abstract describes two patients who developed MRONJ after dental extractions and following treatment with medications known to be associated with MRONJ (zolendronate and denosumab). Both patients also had hypertension and were found to have variants of the ACE gene associated with high blood pressure.

2. **ACE Gene Variant and Hypertension**: Both patients had the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene—one homozygously and the other heterozygously. This variant is known to predispose individuals to hypertension, which is a significant point since both patients presented with high blood pressure.

3. **Hypothesis on Genetic Predisposition and MRONJ**: The abstract suggests that there may be a link between the genetic predisposition to hypertension (due to the ACE gene variant) and an increased risk of MRONJ. This hypothesis is speculative and based on only two cases. The authors themselves note that this is the first report of such an association, indicating that the evidence is preliminary.

4. **Causality vs. Association**: The abstract does not establish a direct causal relationship between the ACE gene mutation and MRONJ. Rather, it posits that the genetic predisposition to hypertension might increase the risk for MRONJ. This is an important distinction because while hypertension may be a risk factor for MRONJ, it does not necessarily imply that the ACE mutation itself causes MRONJ directly.

5. **Lack of Broader Evidence**: Given that the report is based on only two patients and is described as the first of its kind, there is insufficient evidence to broadly generalize that mutations in the ACE gene are a direct cause of MRONJ. More comprehensive studies would be needed to establish a direct link and to understand the mechanisms involved.

In summary, while the abstract suggests an interesting potential link between hypertension predisposition due to ACE gene variants and MRONJ, it does not directly support the statement that mutations in the ACE gene can cause MRONJ. Instead, it opens up an area for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential relationships between hypertension and MRONJ."	The association of the high blood pressure D variant of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene with medication-related jaw osteonecrosis (MRONJ) is described in two Greek patients. The first patient, a 73-year-old man, took zolendronate, 4 mg/100 ml IV once per month for two years for prostate cancer and bone metastases. Three months after drug discontinuation, extraction of the first premolar was performed. After the intervention, he suffered from osteonecrosis of the mandible. He presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that he was homozygous for the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene. The second patient, a 65 years old woman, took denosumab, 120 mg subcutaneously once per month for 6 months for possible bone metastases from breast cancer. Three months after extraction of the first molar, she suffered from MRONJ. He also presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that she had the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene in a heterozygous state, which moderately predisposes to hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that genetic predisposition to hypertension may increase risk for MRONJ.
21	37298659	Masitinib can be used as treatment for hepatitis A virus infections	Masitinib	hepatitis A virus	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that masitinib can be used as treatment for hepatitis A virus (HAV). Here’s how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Problem Statement**: The abstract starts by noting the lack of potent anti-HAV drugs available for clinical use, highlighting the need for effective treatments against HAV, which can cause acute hepatitis and more severe liver failures.

2. **Development of a New Testing Model**: The study describes the creation of HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells—a cell model that stably expresses HAV replicon RNA along with a firefly luciferase reporter. This model was developed to facilitate the screening of drugs for anti-HAV activity, indicating the seriousness of finding effective treatments.

3. **Screening of FDA-Approved Drugs**: The researchers screened 1134 FDA-approved drugs using this new cell model to identify potential candidates with anti-HAV properties.

4. **Finding on Masitinib**: Masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was found to significantly reduce the replication of two different genotypes of HAV (HM175-18f genotype IB and HA11-1299 genotype IIIA) in vitro. This demonstrates masitinib's potential effectiveness against multiple strains of the virus.

5. **Mechanism of Action**: The abstract also notes that masitinib significantly inhibited the activity of the HAV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which is crucial for viral protein synthesis and replication. This suggests that masitinib impacts HAV replication by interfering with a critical step in the viral life cycle.

6. **Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that masitinib may be useful for the treatment of severe HAV infection, based on its demonstrated ability to inhibit HAV replication in the newly developed cell model.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence that masitinib has potential as an anti-HAV agent, as it effectively reduced HAV replication in vitro across different viral genotypes and also targeted a key mechanism of the viral replication process. This supports the potential use of masitinib in treating hepatitis A virus infections, particularly in severe cases where current therapeutic options are inadequate."	The hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection causes acute hepatitis. HAV also induces acute liver failure or acute-on-chronic liver failure; however, no potent anti-HAV drugs are currently available in clinical situations. For anti-HAV drug screening, more convenient and useful models that mimic HAV replication are needed. In the present study, we established HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells, which are HuhT7 cells stably expressing the HAV HM175-18f genotype IB subgenomic replicon RNA harboring the firefly luciferase gene. This system was made by using a PiggyBac-based gene transfer system that introduces nonviral transposon DNA into mammalian cells. Then, we investigated whether 1134 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs exhibited in vitro anti-HAV activity. We further demonstrated that treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor masitinib significantly reduced both HAV HM175-18f genotype IB replication and HAV HA11-1299 genotype IIIA replication. Masitinib also significantly inhibited HAV HM175 internal ribosomal entry-site (IRES) activity. In conclusion, HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells are adequate for anti-HAV drug screening, and masitinib may be useful for the treatment of severe HAV infection.
22	21727647	A mutation in IL-10 decreases the risk of hepatitis C virus infections	IL-10	Hepatitis C Virus	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in IL-10 decreases the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Instead, it suggests a complex interaction between different polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene and susceptibility to HCV, with some polymorphisms potentially increasing susceptibility and others possibly having a protective effect. Here’s how the abstract relates to this topic:

1. **Study Focus**: The study investigates the association between IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to HCV infection in a Pakistani population. IL-10 is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress immune responses, including those against HCV.

2. **Genetic Variants Examined**: Specifically, the polymorphisms studied are located in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene (-1082 G/A, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A). These polymorphisms can affect IL-10 production, which in turn might influence the immune system's ability to combat HCV.

3. **Methodology and Results**:
   - **Genotyping was performed** using ARMS-PCR for the mentioned IL-10 polymorphisms.
   - **Association findings**: There was a suggestive association at the allele level for the -819 C/T (-592 C/A) polymorphism with HCV infection (p=0.03), but not at the genotype level. This could indicate a more nuanced role of allele-specific expression rather than broad genotype effects.
   - **No association was found** for the -1082 allele, but the GG genotype at this site showed a positive association with HCV, suggesting increased susceptibility, not decreased risk.
   - **Haplotype and diplotype analysis** revealed higher frequencies of certain haplotypes and diplotypes in HCV patients compared to controls. Interestingly, the GCC/ATA diplotype appeared to have a protective effect against HCV, aligning more closely with the initial statement about decreasing risk but specific to this genetic combination only.

4. **Conclusions of the Study**: The study concludes that variations in the IL-10 promoter region affect the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, which influences HCV susceptibility. This indicates that while some IL-10 promoter mutations might reduce the risk of HCV, others could increase it, depending on the specific alleles and their expression profiles.

In summary, the abstract suggests that while certain IL-10 gene polymorphisms (specifically the GCC/ATA diplotype) might decrease the risk of HCV infections, others can increase susceptibility. Therefore, the statement that a mutation in IL-10 decreases the risk of hepatitis C virus infections is too broad and not universally supported by the findings presented in the abstract. Instead, the effect of IL-10 polymorphisms on HCV susceptibility is shown to be more complex and dependent on the specific alleles and combinations thereof."	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) commonly causes a chronic infection but few of patients are able to clear the virus naturally. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the immune response against HCV. Interindividual variations in IL-10 production are genetically contributed by polymorphisms within the IL-10 promoter region. This study aimed to investigate the association of the IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G/A, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A polymorphisms with HCV infection susceptibility in Pakistani individuals. Eighty-nine chronically infected patients and 99 controls were enrolled in the study. IL-10 (-1,082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A) genotyping was performed by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). A suggestive evidence of association with hepatitis C was obtained for the IL-10 -819 C/T (-592 C/A) (p: 0.03) promoter polymorphism at the allele level  but not in genotype distribution. The IL-10 -1082 allele showed no association while positive association of GG (p: 0.001) gene and negative association for GA (0.001) gene were observed.  Higher frequencies were observed for GTA (p: 0.02), ACC (p: 0.01) haplotype and GCC/GTA (p: 0.005) diplotype in HCV patients than controls while diplotype GCC/ATA showed protective effect against HCV. Our findings suggest that different IL-10 gene polymorphisms may lead to an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses which may in turn influence the susceptibility to HCV infection.
23	24640679	A mutation in IL-28B contributes directly to the susceptibility of hepatitis C virus	IL-28B	Hepatitis C Virus	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in IL-28B contributes directly to the susceptibility of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here’s how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Focus on IL-28B Gene**: The abstract discusses the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IL-28B gene, directly linking it to various aspects of HCV infection. IL-28B is part of the interferon-lambda family, which plays a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections, including HCV.

2. **Impact on Antiviral Therapy**: Significant attention in the abstract is given to how allelic variants of IL-28B affect the response to antiviral therapies. The efficacy of these therapies can be influenced by genetic variants, which suggests that IL-28B variants might impact not just the susceptibility to HCV but also the outcome of the infection and treatment response. This supports the idea that IL-28B mutations could play a critical role in the overall dynamics of HCV infection.

3. **Biological Role and Clinical Associations**: The abstract notes the biological role of interferon-lambda (produced by IL-28B and related genes) and discusses other associations of IL-28B allelic variants with different clinical signs of chronic hepatitis C. This broad discussion about the genetic marker’s impact on disease presentation and progression underscores its direct relevance to HCV susceptibility.

4. **Practical and Future Use of Genetic Marker**: The mention of the practical use of the IL-28B genetic marker in managing chronic hepatitis C, along with future prospects, indicates that understanding variations in this gene is considered valuable for both current medical practices and upcoming medical research and treatments. This also suggests an established link between IL-28B variations and significant clinical outcomes in HCV-infected individuals.

In summary, the abstract supports the idea that mutations in the IL-28B gene contribute directly to the susceptibility and management of hepatitis C virus infection by detailing how these genetic variations affect the disease’s clinical course and response to treatment. The specific focus on the IL-28B SNP and its implications in the context of HCV infection clearly aligns with the statement that mutations in this gene influence HCV susceptibility."	Chronic hepatitis C remains one of the most urgent problems of today's medicine. The review unravels the current view of the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) gene in different aspects of hepatitis C virus infection. Major attention is paid to the discussion of the value of the allelic variants of IL-28B during standard double and current triple antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, the paper covers the biological role of interferon-lambda, a product of IL-28A, B, and IL-29 gene expression, other associations of the allelic variants of the IL-28B gene with different clinical signs, as well as the possibilities of practical use of this genetic marker in chronic hepatitis C today and futures prospects.
24	33865446	Lecanemab is an effective treatment for Alzheimers	Lecanemab 	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract provides mixed support for the statement that Lecanemab is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Here’s an analysis of the key points from the abstract that contribute to this conclusion:

1. **Study Design and Objective**: The abstract describes a randomized double-blind clinical trial (BAN2401-G000-201) that tested different doses of Lecanemab against a placebo in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The study's goal was to identify the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect, evaluated through changes in clinical and biomarker measures.

2. **Primary Endpoint at 12 Months**: At 12 months, the 10 mg/kg biweekly dose of Lecanemab did not meet the primary endpoint set for the trial. The primary endpoint required an 80% probability of achieving at least a 25% clinical reduction in decline as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), but this dose only achieved a 64% probability. This result indicates that, initially, Lecanemab did not demonstrate the expected level of effectiveness within the first year of treatment.

3. **Secondary and Extended Endpoint Results at 18 Months**: However, the results were more promising at 18 months. Lecanemab showed a statistically significant reduction in brain amyloid levels and a consistent reduction in clinical decline across multiple measures (ADCOMS, ADAS-Cog14, CDR-SB). These findings suggest that, over a longer period, Lecanemab might be effective in reducing both the pathological features of Alzheimer’s (such as amyloid plaques) and the clinical symptoms of cognitive decline.

4. **Safety and Tolerability**: Lecanemab was reported to be well-tolerated, with a 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion (ARIA-E) at the 10 mg/kg biweekly dose. This is a known side effect of amyloid-targeting treatments and is an important consideration for overall treatment evaluation.

5. **Ongoing Research**: The conclusion of the study mentions that further research in the form of a phase 3 trial (Clarity AD) is underway. This indicates that while the results at 18 months are promising, additional data is needed to fully validate Lecanemab's effectiveness and safety.

**Conclusion**: The abstract provides evidence that Lecanemab has potential as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, particularly in reducing amyloid deposits and slowing clinical decline over 18 months. However, the failure to meet the primary endpoint at 12 months suggests that the effectiveness of Lecanemab may not be as robust or as rapid as hoped. Thus, while Lecanemab shows potential, its efficacy as a treatment for Alzheimer’s is still under investigation, and more definitive results are expected from ongoing clinical trials."	Lecanemab (BAN2401), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, preferentially targets soluble aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ), with activity across oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils. BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. BAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly. BAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints. A phase 3 study (Clarity AD) in early Alzheimer's disease is underway. Clinical Trials.gov NCT01767311 .
25	31706733	ALZ-801 can be used as treatment for Alzheimer's disease	ALZ-801	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract provides supportive evidence that ALZ-801 could potentially be used as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it stops short of conclusive proof, as it primarily discusses the rationale and planned future testing for ALZ-801. Here’s how the abstract supports the potential of ALZ-801 as an Alzheimer's treatment:

1. **Context and Challenges in AD Treatment**: The abstract begins by discussing the historical challenges in developing disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, noting that amyloid-beta (Aβ) targeted therapies have had mixed results. This sets the stage for the introduction of ALZ-801 by framing it within the context of these challenges and the ongoing debate about the amyloid hypothesis.

2. **Validation of the Amyloid Hypothesis**: It mentions that the antiamyloid antibody aducanumab showed modest efficacy in a phase 3 trial, which helps validate amyloid as a therapeutic target. This is important because it provides a backdrop against which ALZ-801’s mechanism of action is positioned.

3. **Mechanism of Action**: ALZ-801 is described as an agent that can effectively inhibit Aβ oligomer formation or block their toxicity. The abstract notes that soluble Aβ oligomers are considered critical in driving neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's. By targeting these oligomers specifically, ALZ-801 is implied to have a potentially more direct and effective mechanism in combating AD pathology compared to other amyloid-targeting drugs that have shown inconsistent results.

4. **Drug Characteristics**: ALZ-801 is highlighted for its favorable safety profile, high brain penetration, and ability to achieve sustained brain levels that can prevent oligomer formation or inhibit their toxicity. These pharmacological attributes are crucial for a disease-modifying drug in AD, suggesting that ALZ-801 could overcome some of the limitations faced by previous treatments.

5. **Future Testing**: The abstract ends by mentioning an upcoming phase 3 trial of ALZ-801 in a specific group of AD patients (APOE4/4 homozygous with early AD). This upcoming trial is critical as it aims to effectively test the amyloid oligomer hypothesis, indicating that while preliminary data is promising, definitive evidence of efficacy from this trial is still pending.

**Conclusion**: The abstract supports the notion that ALZ-801 has the potential to be used as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, based on its targeted mechanism of action against Aβ oligomers and favorable drug properties. However, the statement that it can currently be used as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is premature without results from the phase 3 trial, which is necessary to confirm its efficacy and safety in a clinical setting. The abstract provides a strong rationale for why ALZ-801 could be effective, but clinical validation is awaited."	Development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been challenging, with no drugs approved to date. The failures of several amyloid-targeted programs have led many to dismiss the amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis of AD. An antiamyloid antibody aducanumab recently showed modest but significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial, providing important validation of amyloid as a therapeutic target. However, the inconsistent results observed with aducanumab may be explained by the limited brain penetration and lack of selectivity for the soluble Aβ oligomers, which are implicated as upstream drivers of neurodegeneration by multiple studies. Development of agents that can effectively inhibit Aβ oligomer formation or block their toxicity is therefore warranted. An ideal drug would cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently and achieve sustained brain levels that can continuously prevent oligomer formation or inhibit their toxicity. A late-stage candidate with these attributes is ALZ-801, an oral drug with a favorable safety profile and high brain penetration that can robustly inhibit Aβ oligomer formation. An upcoming phase 3 trial with ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 homozygous patients with early AD will effectively test this amyloid oligomer hypothesis.
26	23927914	A mutation in APP leads to dementia	APP	Dementia	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in the APP (amyloid precursor protein) gene can lead to dementia, specifically in the context of familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Discussion of Genetic Causes**: The abstract mentions that a small proportion of dementia cases, particularly those with early-onset forms, are due to autosomal dominant mutations in specific genes. This includes mention of mutations in the APP gene, along with PSEN1 and PSEN2, which are well-known to be implicated in early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

2. **Mendelian Inheritance**: It notes that these forms of dementia are often due to Mendelian disease, implying a direct causal relationship between the mutation and the disease. This type of inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant) means that if a parent carries a mutation in one of these genes, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation to each offspring. Those who inherit the mutation have a very high lifetime risk (over 95%) of developing dementia.

3. **Genetic Testing Focus**: The review specifically focuses on the evidence for and approach to genetic testing for Alzheimer’s disease related to mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes. The inclusion of APP in this context underscores its importance and relevance in genetic testing strategies aimed at identifying individuals at high risk for early-onset Alzheimer's disease due to these specific genetic mutations.

4. **Implication of Genetic Testing and Counseling**: By discussing genetic testing and counseling, the abstract implies that identifying mutations in the APP gene (among others) is critical for risk assessment and management in families with a history of early-onset dementia. This is particularly relevant for guiding decisions about preventive strategies, clinical management, and family planning.

In summary, the abstract provides strong support for the statement that mutations in the APP gene lead to dementia, specifically within the framework of familial early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It highlights the genetic basis of the disease, the role of APP in this context, and the importance of genetic testing for individuals in affected families."	25% of all people aged 55 years and older have a family history of dementia. For most, the family history is due to genetically complex disease, where many genetic variations of small effect interact to increase risk of dementia. The lifetime risk of dementia for these families is about 20%, compared with 10% in the general population. A small proportion of families have an autosomal dominant family history of early-onset dementia, which is often due to mendelian disease, caused by a mutation in one of the dementia genes. Each family member has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, which confers a lifetime dementia risk of over 95%. In this Review, we focus on the evidence for, and the approach to, genetic testing in Alzheimer's disease (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes), frontotemporal dementia (MAPT, GRN, C9ORF72, and other genes), and other familial dementias. We conclude by discussing the practical aspects of genetic counselling.
27	33930186	Mutations in PGRN are linked to dementia	PGRN	Dementia	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that mutations in the PGRN (progranulin) gene are linked to dementia. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of PGRN in Neurodegeneration**: The abstract emphasizes that progranulin (PGRN) is a neurotrophic factor with various neuroprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, promoting neuron survival and neurite growth, and participation in normal lysosomal function. These roles indicate that PGRN is critical for maintaining neuronal health and function.

2. **Association with Neurodegenerative Dementias**: It is specifically noted that mutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) have been found in several types of neurodegenerative dementias, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This direct mention of mutations in GRN being present in dementia cases establishes a clear link between PGRN mutations and these neurodegenerative conditions.

3. **Pathological Changes and PGRN Deficiency**: The abstract discusses how PGRN deficiency contributes to various pathological changes associated with dementia. These include the aggregation of tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), overproduction of amyloid-beta (Aβ), neuroinflammation, lysosomal dysfunction, neuronal death, and synaptic deficits. Each of these pathological features is central to the progression of dementia, particularly in diseases like FTLD and AD.

4. **Therapeutic Potential of Targeting PGRN**: Highlighting PGRN as a target for therapeutic strategies in various models of neurodegeneration further supports the importance of PGRN in dementia. The development of therapies aimed at augmenting PGRN levels or function suggests that enhancing PGRN activity could mitigate the progression or onset of dementia symptoms.

5. **Summary of PGRN’s Impact**: By summarizing the effects of PGRN deficiency and the therapeutic potential of targeting PGRN, the abstract underscores the significant impact that PGRN has on neurodegenerative processes leading to dementia. It also implies that understanding and potentially correcting PGRN dysfunction is crucial for addressing these debilitating diseases.

In conclusion, the abstract provides substantial evidence that mutations in the PGRN gene are linked to the development of dementia, through both the direct association of these mutations with neurodegenerative diseases and the detailed explanation of how PGRN impacts key pathological processes involved in these conditions."	Long-term or severe lack of protective factors is important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementia. Progranulin (PGRN), a neurotrophic factor expressed mainly in neurons and microglia, has various neuroprotective effects such as anti-inflammatory effects, promoting neuron survival and neurite growth, and participating in normal lysosomal function. Mutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) have been found in several neurodegenerative dementias, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, PGRN deficiency and PGRN hydrolytic products (GRNs) in the pathological changes related to dementia, including aggregation of tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), amyloid-β (Aβ) overproduction, neuroinflammation, lysosomal dysfunction, neuronal death, and synaptic deficit have been summarized. Furthermore, as some therapeutic strategies targeting PGRN have been developed in various models, we highlighted PGRN as a potential anti-neurodegeneration target in dementia.
28	32335869	Mutations in ESR2 do not correlate to dementia	ESR2	Dementia	1	"The biomedical abstract provides mixed support for the statement that mutations in ESR2 (estrogen receptor beta) do not correlate to dementia. The abstract suggests that while overall, ESR2 polymorphisms may not be significantly associated with dementia risk, specific polymorphisms such as rs4986938 show a significant association with dementia in the Asian population. Here’s a breakdown of the abstract’s findings:

1. **General Findings on ESR2 and Dementia**: The meta-analysis reviewed studies totaling 20,609 subjects and found that combined data on ESR2 polymorphisms generally did not demonstrate an association with an increased risk of dementia. This part of the finding supports the statement that mutations in ESR2 do not correlate to dementia.

2. **Specific Findings on rs4986938 Polymorphism**: Contrary to the general findings, the abstract reports a significant association between the rs4986938 polymorphism in the ESR2 gene and dementia risk in the Asian population. The presence of the A allele in this polymorphism was shown to have a protective effect against dementia. This suggests that while overall ESR2 mutations may not be correlated with dementia, specific polymorphisms can have significant implications for dementia risk.

3. **Implications of Findings**: The discovery of a significant association in a specific ethnic group highlights the complexity of genetic influences on dementia, suggesting that the impact of ESR2 polymorphisms might vary based on genetic background or other population-specific factors.

4. **Conclusion and Future Research**: The abstract concludes that more studies are needed to verify the potential role of rs4986938 as a genetic marker for dementia in the Asian population. This acknowledges that the findings are preliminary and that further research is necessary to fully understand the role of ESR2 in dementia.

**Summary**: The abstract supports the statement that mutations in ESR2 do not correlate to dementia risk when considering the data set as a whole. However, it also highlights that specific polymorphisms, such as rs4986938, do show a significant association in certain populations. Therefore, while the general statement is supported, the details reveal a more nuanced picture that suggests potential exceptions based on specific genetic variations and demographic factors."	Strong evidence supports the involvement of sex steroid hormones in the development and progression of dementia. Attention has been largely focused on the association between genetic variants of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα, ESR1) with dementia, although several studies indicate that ERβ is predominantly expressed in the brain. Interestingly, however, a limited number of studies evaluate the role of ERβ (ESR2) in dementia. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the association between ESR2 genetic polymorphisms and the risk of dementia. All the relevant studies evaluating ESR2 genetic polymorphisms and dementia were identified through online databases. In total, 14 studies including 20,609 subjects were analyzed. Collectively, it was found that a combined data set of ESR2 polymorphisms was not associated with dementia risk. Interestingly, ESR2 rs4986938 polymorphism is significantly associated with dementia in the Asian population (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91, P = 0.006). The carrier of A allele in rs4986938 exhibits a protective effect against dementia (A vs. G, OR = 0.6633, P = 0.012; AA + GA vs. GG, OR = 0.6499, P = 0.014; GA vs. AA + GG, OR = 0.6672, P = 0.025; GA vs. GG, OR = 0.6617, P = 0.022). In conclusion, our study suggests that ESR2 genetic polymorphisms are not significantly associated with dementia risk. ESR2 rs4986938 may have potential as a genetic marker for dementia in the Asian population. However, further studies need to verify this conclusion.
29	29687167	A mutation in BRI2 can lead to Alzheimers in humans	BRI2	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in BRI2 can lead to Alzheimer's in humans, but indirectly, emphasizing BRI2's protective role against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the consequences of its dysfunction. Here’s how the abstract supports this:

1. **Role of BRI2 in APP Metabolism**: The abstract notes that BRI2 is a type II transmembrane protein that binds to amyloid protein precursor (APP) and inhibits all α, β, and γ pathways of APP proteolysis. Since aberrant APP metabolism is crucial to the pathogenesis of AD, BRI2's role in regulating APP proteolysis directly links it to the disease mechanism.

2. **Genetic Studies in Mice**: The abstract mentions that studies involving AD model mice crossed with either BRI2 transgenic or BRI2 knockout mice confirmed that BRI2 acts as an anti-Alzheimer gene. This suggests that the presence of functional BRI2 provides a protective effect against AD, whereas the absence or dysfunction of BRI2 (as would occur with deleterious mutations) contributes to the development of AD-like pathology.

3. **Human Familial Dementia and BRI2**: It is stated that mutations in BRI2 are known to cause rare familial dementias in humans. While the abstract does not specify Alzheimer’s disease explicitly in this context, the implication is that mutations affecting BRI2 function are linked to dementia, which often includes AD, especially given the gene's role in APP processing—a central element in AD pathology.

4. **Evidence from Disease Model Mice**: The use of knock-in mice harboring a disease mutation in BRI2 revealed memory defects attributable to the loss of BRI2’s protective function. This model provides a mechanistic link between BRI2 dysfunction (due to mutations) and cognitive impairments typical of AD.

5. **Further Research and Therapeutic Potential**: The abstract concludes that further studies are necessary to understand BRI2's anti-Alzheimer mechanism fully and to explore potential therapeutic applications targeting this pathway. This ongoing research interest underscores the significance of BRI2 in AD pathogenesis and treatment.

**Conclusion**: Although the abstract does not explicitly state that mutations in BRI2 lead to Alzheimer’s in humans, it strongly implies that such mutations, by disrupting BRI2's normal protective function against APP misprocessing, contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia, including AD. Thus, the abstract supports the statement by highlighting the critical role of BRI2 in neuroprotection and the implications of its genetic alterations."	There are several theories regarding the etiologies of Alzheimer disease (AD). Considering that all genes responsible for familial AD are amyloid protein precursor (APP) or APP metabolizing enzymes, surely aberrant APP metabolism is crucial to pathogenesis of AD. BRI2, a type II transmembrane protein, binds APP and inhibits all α, β, and γ pathways of APP proteolysis. Crossing AD model mice with BRI2 transgenic or BRI2 knockout mice confirmed that BRI2 is an anti-Alzheimer gene. Mutations of BRI2 are known to cause rare familial dementias in human. Analysis of knock-in mice harboring the disease mutation revealed the memory defect in the mice, attributable to loss of protective function of BRI2. Further studies are needed to decipher this anti-Alzheimer mechanism of BRI2 to develop a novel therapeutic application for AD. In this review, after describing basic assumptions in AD study, we focus on BRI2 as an anti-Alzheimer gene.
30	33458965	Mutations in mannose-binding lectin (MBL) correlate with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis	MBL	Rheumatoid Arthritis	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in mannose-binding lectin (MBL) correlate with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in all populations. Rather, it indicates that the association between MBL gene polymorphisms and RA susceptibility varies significantly across different ethnic groups, with some showing a strong correlation while others do not. Here's a breakdown of how the abstract relates to this topic:

1. **Inconsistent Results Across Studies**: The abstract begins by noting that previous studies investigating the effect of MBL gene polymorphisms on RA susceptibility in different ethnic populations have yielded inconsistent results. This variability suggests that the correlation between MBL mutations and RA may be influenced by ethnic-specific genetic backgrounds or environmental factors.

2. **Meta-Analysis Approach**: The meta-analysis included 14 articles and 36 datasets to evaluate the association more comprehensively. The use of both random and fixed effect models to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) enhances the robustness of the findings.

3. **Ethnic-Specific Findings**: The results highlight significant differences among ethnic groups:
   - **Brazilian Populations**: There was a strong association between certain MBL polymorphisms (rs1800450 and MBL-A/O) and increased risk of RA.
   - **East Asian Populations**: A significant relationship was found for the rs11003125 polymorphism with RA, suggesting a predisposition in this group.
   - **Inverse Associations**: In East Asians and Indians, certain polymorphisms (like rs5030737 and rs1800450) showed inverse associations with RA, indicating a protective effect or no effect at all.
   - **Caucasians**: No association was found between any MBL polymorphisms and RA susceptibility, which clearly contradicts the idea of a universal correlation between MBL mutations and RA across all populations.

4. **Conclusion on Ethnic Variability**: The conclusion emphasizes that while structural polymorphisms in exon 1 of the MBL gene may significantly contribute to RA susceptibility in some populations (Brazilian and Indian), functional polymorphisms in the promoter region are more associated with RA in East Asians. The lack of association in Caucasians further indicates that MBL gene polymorphisms' impact on RA is not consistent across all ethnic groups.

In summary, the abstract suggests that the relationship between MBL gene polymorphisms and RA is complex and highly dependent on ethnic background. This undermines the statement that mutations in MBL are correlated with the risk of RA in all populations, instead supporting a more nuanced view that this correlation exists in certain populations but not universally."	The effect of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene polymorphisms on susceptibility of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were evaluated in ethnically different populations, whereas the results were always inconsistent. Fourteen articles involving 36 datasets were recruited to evaluate the association between MBL gene polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis in a meta-analysis. The random or fixed effect models were used to evaluate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Stratified analysis by ethnicities was conducted and the result revealed that rs1800450 (T vs C, OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.67, P < .05) and MBL-A/O (T vs C, OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08-1.34, P < .001) were strongly associated with RA in Brazilian populations. In addition, the significant relationship between rs11003125 (T vs C, OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.06-1.26, P < .05) with RA were also observed in East Asian populations. Meanwhile, the inverse associations between rs5030737 with RA in East Asians and rs1800450 with RA in Indians were acquired. However, no association between any MBL polymorphism with RA susceptibility was confirmed in Caucasians. The structural polymorphisms in exon 1 of MBL gene may significantly contribute to susceptibility and development of RA in Brazilian and Indian populations, whereas the functional polymorphisms in the promoter region were more likely to associate with RA in East Asians.
31	24435167	A mutation in PAX5 can contribute to leukemogenesis	PAX5	Leukemogenesis	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that a mutation in PAX5 can contribute to leukemogenesis, specifically in the context of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here’s how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of PAX5 in B-cell Development**: The abstract begins by highlighting the critical role of PAX5 as a transcription factor pivotal for B-cell commitment and maintenance. This establishes the fundamental biological importance of PAX5 in normal B-cell development.

2. **PAX5 Mutations in Leukemia**: It notes that PAX5 is one of the most frequent targets of somatic mutations in B-cell precursor ALL. This directly links mutations in PAX5 with a specific type of leukemia, suggesting that alterations in this gene are a common event in the pathogenesis of the disease.

3. **Mechanism of Leukemogenesis via PAX5 Fusions**: The abstract details various PAX5 rearrangements that result in the expression of in-frame fusion genes. These fusion proteins retain the PAX5 DNA-binding domain but are fused to different C-terminal domains from diverse partners, leading to the formation of chimeric proteins that function differently from the wild-type PAX5. These fusion proteins are described as functioning as aberrant transcription factors that antagonize the activity of wild-type PAX5, a mechanism that contributes to leukemogenesis by disrupting normal B-cell development and function.

4. **Biochemical and Functional Properties of PAX5 Fusions**: Further insights are provided into the biochemical and functional properties of several uncharacterized PAX5 fusion proteins. Despite retaining some capabilities of wild-type PAX5, such as nuclear localization and DNA binding to PAX5 target sequences, these fusion proteins exhibit altered functions. Notably, they fail to induce transcription of critical genes like Cd79a, which is essential for B-cell receptor expression in B-cells, highlighting a dysfunctional aspect that could contribute to leukemia development.

5. **Implications for Leukemia Development**: The abstract concludes that the study of multiple PAX5 fusion proteins demonstrates both common and unique properties that likely dictate their function and impact on leukemia development. This suggests that different PAX5 mutations may contribute variably to the disease based on the nature of the fusion partner and the resultant changes in transcriptional regulation.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that mutations in PAX5, particularly those leading to the formation of fusion proteins, play a significant role in the development of leukemia by altering normal PAX5 function and interfering with B-cell development. This supports the statement that a mutation in PAX5 can contribute to leukemogenesis, particularly in the context of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia."	PAX5, a transcription factor pivotal for B-cell commitment and maintenance, is one of the most frequent targets of somatic mutations in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A number of PAX5 rearrangements result in the expression of in-frame fusion genes encoding chimeric proteins, which at the N-terminus consistently retain the PAX5 DNA-binding paired domain fused to the C-terminal domains of a markedly heterogeneous group of fusion partners. PAX5 fusion proteins are thought to function as aberrant transcription factors, which antagonize wild-type PAX5 activity. To gain mechanistic insight into the role of PAX5 fusion proteins in leukemogenesis, the biochemical and functional properties of uncharacterized fusions: PAX5-DACH1, PAX5-DACH2, PAX5-ETV6, PAX5-HIPK1, and PAX5-POM121 were ascertained. Independent of the subcellular distribution of the wild-type partner proteins, ectopic expression of all PAX5 fusion proteins showed a predominant nuclear localization, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation all of the chimeric proteins exhibited binding to endogenous PAX5 target sequences. Furthermore, consistent with the presence of potential oligomerization motifs provided by the partner proteins, the self-interaction capability of several fusion proteins was confirmed. Remarkably, a subset of the PAX5 fusion proteins conferred CD79A promoter activity; however, in contrast with wild-type PAX5, the fusion proteins were unable to induce Cd79a transcription in a murine plasmacytoma cell line. These data show that leukemia-associated PAX5 fusion proteins share some dominating characteristics such as nuclear localization and DNA binding but also show distinctive features. This comparative study of multiple PAX5 fusion proteins demonstrates both common and unique properties, which likely dictate their function and impact on leukemia development.
32	34098113	A mutation to HTT can lead to Huntington's Disease	HTT	Huntington's Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that a mutation in the HTT gene can lead to Huntington's Disease (HD). Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Cause of Huntington's Disease**: The abstract clearly states that Huntington's disease is an autosomal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an extended trinucleotide CAG repetition in the HTT gene. This direct statement links a specific genetic mutation—increased CAG repeats within the HTT gene—to the pathogenesis of HD.

2. **Effect of the Mutation**: It details the consequences of the mutation, noting that mutant HTT (mHTT) proteins interfere with the normal cellular functions of the wild-type huntingtin protein (HTT). The wild-type HTT is involved in essential cellular processes like vesicle transportation, cell division, transcription regulation, autophagy, and tissue maintenance. By interfering with these processes, mHTT contributes to the neurological decline seen in HD.

3. **Detrimental Effects of mHTT**: The abstract mentions that mHTT not only disrupts the normal functions of HTT but also causes additional detrimental effects, thereby exacerbating the disease's impact on the body. This underlines the destructive role of the HTT mutation in cellular health and function.

4. **Therapeutic Targeting of mHTT**: The discussion of various approaches to reduce mHTT expression, including non-allele-specific and allele-specific silencing, further emphasizes the central role of the HTT mutation in HD. Targeting mHTT for treatment highlights its direct involvement in the disease and the need to mitigate its effects to manage HD.

5. **Innovative Genetic Techniques**: The mention of cutting-edge technologies like CRISPR prime editing for targeting HD underscores the ongoing research efforts to directly address the genetic root causes of the disease, namely the mutations in HTT. This suggests a recognition within the scientific community of the critical need to correct or manage the genetic alterations in HTT to combat HD.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides explicit evidence that mutations in the HTT gene, specifically the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats, are the causative factor in Huntington's Disease. It supports the statement both by specifying the mutation responsible for HD and by discussing the consequences of this mutation on cellular function and disease progression."	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disorder caused by extended trinucleotide CAG repetition in the HTT gene. Wild-type huntingtin protein (HTT) is essential, involved in a variety of crucial cellular functions such as vesicle transportation, cell division, transcription regulation, autophagy, and tissue maintenance. The mutant HTT (mHTT) proteins in the body interfere with HTT's normal cellular functions and cause additional detrimental effects. In this review, we discuss multiple approaches targeting DNA and RNA to reduce mHTT expression. These approaches are categorized into non-allele-specific silencing and allele-specific-silencing using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplogroup analysis. Additionally, this review discusses a potential application of recent CRISPR prime editing technology in targeting HD.
33	31217356	Expression of DCXR is associated with chronic kidney disease	DCXR	Chronic kidney disease	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that the expression of DCXR (dicarbonyl and L-xylulose reductase) is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here’s how the abstract substantiates this claim:

1. **Focus on Renoprotective Factors**: The study centers on evaluating the association between various renoprotective factor gene expressions, including DCXR, with CKD severity and outcomes. This sets the stage to specifically investigate how these factors correlate with the progression and severity of the disease.

2. **Strongest Association with Disease Progression**: The abstract specifically highlights that among 197 renoprotective factors analyzed, downregulation of DCXR showed the strongest association with disease progression in CKD patients. This finding is critical as it directly links decreased expression of DCXR with worsening conditions of CKD.

3. **Validation in Independent Cohort**: The association between reduced DCXR expression and increased disease severity was validated in an independent cohort of 225 patients with nephrotic syndrome from the multicenter NEPTUNE study. Validation across different cohorts strengthens the reliability of the finding that DCXR downregulation is associated with CKD.

4. **Associations with Clinical Indicators**: Reduced expression of DCXR was significantly linked to key clinical indicators of CKD severity, such as higher degrees of histological damage, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates, and increased urinary protein levels. These relationships provide a clear connection between DCXR expression levels and the physical manifestations of CKD.

5. **Further Confirmations and Correlations**: The downregulation of DCXR in CKD was confirmed across three publicly available transcriptomics datasets, enhancing the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, DCXR expression was positively correlated with the activity of enzymes involved in dicarbonyl stress detoxification, suggesting a functional role in mitigating pathways that contribute to CKD pathology.

6. **Therapeutic Implications**: The abstract notes that treatments with SGLT2 inhibitors, which enhance DCXR expression, have beneficial effects on renal proximal tubular cells under diabetic conditions. This further supports the protective role of DCXR expression against CKD progression.

**Summary**: The evidence presented in the abstract robustly supports the association between DCXR expression and chronic kidney disease. The findings indicate that lower expression of DCXR correlates with more severe CKD and worse outcomes, thus affirming the statement that expression of DCXR is associated with chronic kidney disease."	An imbalance of nephroprotective factors and renal damaging molecules contributes to development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated associations of renoprotective factor gene expression patterns with CKD severity and outcome. Gene expression profiles of 197 previously reported renoprotective factors were analyzed in a discovery cohort in renal biopsies of 63 CKD patients. Downregulation of dicarbonyl and L-xylulose reductase (DCXR) showed the strongest association with disease progression. This significant association was validated in an independent set of 225 patients with nephrotic syndrome from the multicenter NEPTUNE cohort. Reduced expression of DCXR was significantly associated with degree of histological damage as well as with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and increased urinary protein levels. DCXR downregulation in CKD was confirmed in 3 publicly available transcriptomics data sets in the context of CKD. Expression of DCXR showed positive correlations to enzymes that are involved in dicarbonyl stress detoxification based on transcriptomics profiles. The sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors canagliflozin and empagliflozin showed a beneficial effect on renal proximal tubular cells under diabetic stimuli-enhanced DCXR gene expression. In summary, lower expression of the renoprotective factor DCXR in renal tissue is associated with more severe disease and worse outcome in human CKD.
34	29518696	Disregulation of EAF2 can lead to prostate cancer	EAF2	prostate cancer	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that dysregulation of EAF2 can lead to prostate cancer, highlighting a specific interaction with another tumor suppressor gene, p53, and implicating the STAT3 signaling pathway in the process. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Interaction Between EAF2 and p53**: The abstract notes that both EAF2 and p53 are frequently dysregulated in prostate cancers, and their concurrent dysregulation (p53 nuclear staining and EAF2 downregulation) is associated with high Gleason scores, an indicator of more aggressive and advanced prostate cancer. This establishes a foundational link between EAF2 dysregulation and severe prostate cancer outcomes.

2. **Experimental Evidence in Murine Models**: It mentions that combined loss of EAF2 and p53 in a murine model induced prostate tumors. This direct evidence from an animal model strongly supports the role of EAF2 dysregulation in promoting prostate tumorigenesis, especially when occurring alongside alterations in p53.

3. **Cell Proliferation and Migration**: The abstract describes experiments showing that concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53 in prostate cancer cells enhanced cell proliferation and migration, key processes in cancer development and metastasis. This suggests that EAF2, like p53, normally functions to suppress these oncogenic processes, and their loss leads to increased cancer cell aggressiveness.

4. **RNA-seq Analysis and STAT3 Signaling**: RNA sequencing analyses identified differentially regulated genes in response to the knockdown of p53 and EAF2, many of which were associated with the STAT3 signaling pathway. The activation of this pathway was confirmed through increased phosphorylation of STAT3 (p-STAT3) observed in the prostate of Eaf2-/-p53-/- mice. Since STAT3 is known to promote oncogenic processes such as cell proliferation and survival, this finding links the dysregulation of EAF2 (and p53) to a specific molecular pathway known to drive cancer.

5. **Relevance to Human Prostate Cancer**: The increase in p-STAT3 immunostaining in human prostate cancer specimens with EAF2 downregulation and/or aberrant p53 activity further bridges the experimental findings to human disease, suggesting that similar mechanisms are at play in human prostate cancers as observed in experimental models.

6. **Functional Interactions and Tumorigenesis**: The statement that simultaneous inactivation of EAF2 and p53 can activate STAT3 and drive prostate tumorigenesis encapsulates the core finding that EAF2 dysregulation, particularly in conjunction with p53 loss, contributes to the development of prostate cancer through the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides compelling evidence that dysregulation of EAF2, especially in combination with p53 alterations, can lead to prostate cancer by enhancing cell proliferation and migration, and activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is known to contribute to oncogenesis. This supports the statement that dysregulation of EAF2 can lead to prostate cancer, highlighting a complex interplay with other genetic factors and signaling pathways."	The tumor suppressor genes EAF2 and p53 are frequently dysregulated in prostate cancers. Recently, we reported that concurrent p53 nuclear staining and EAF2 downregulation were associated with high Gleason score. Combined loss of EAF2 and p53 in a murine model induced prostate tumors, and concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53 in prostate cancer cells enhanced proliferation and migration, further suggesting that EAF2 and p53 could functionally interact in the suppression of prostate tumorigenesis. Here, RNA-seq analyses identified differentially regulated genes in response to concurrent knockdown of p53 and EAF2. Several of these genes were associated with the STAT3 signaling pathway, and this was verified by significantly increased p-STAT3 immunostaining in the Eaf2<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>-/-</sup> mouse prostate. STAT3 knockdown abrogated the stimulation of C4-2 cell proliferation by concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53. Furthermore, immunostaining of p-STAT3 was increased in human prostate cancer specimens with EAF2 downregulation and/or p53 nuclear staining. Our findings suggest that simultaneous inactivation of EAF2 and p53 can act to activate STAT3 and drive prostate tumorigenesis.
35	36007472	GAB2 expression can contribute to osteoarthritis	GAB2	Osteoarthritis	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that GAB2 expression can contribute to osteoarthritis (OA). Here is a detailed breakdown of how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Role of GAB2 in Signaling Pathways**: The abstract states that GAB2 (Grb2-associated-Binding protein-2) is involved in various signaling pathways, including inflammatory signaling pathways, which are crucial in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including osteoarthritis. GAB2's role in these pathways suggests it could influence processes like inflammation that are central to OA development.

2. **GAB2 Expression in OA Models**: It is noted that GAB2 expression was elevated in chondrocytes in both in vivo and in vitro models of osteoarthritis. This increase in GAB2 expression in OA models directly correlates its expression with the disease state, suggesting a potential contributory role in OA pathogenesis.

3. **Impact of GAB2 Inhibition on OA Markers**: The study found that inhibition of GAB2 (using siRNA) resulted in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3, MMP13) and inflammatory enzymes (iNOS, COX2) which are known to be involved in cartilage breakdown and inflammation in OA. Additionally, inhibition increased the expression of markers associated with cartilage synthesis and autophagy (COL2, SOX9, ATG7, Beclin-1, LC3II/LC3I). These changes are beneficial in the context of OA, as they suggest a shift towards cartilage repair and reduced degradation.

4. **Effect on Inflammatory Signaling Pathways**: Further demonstrating GAB2's role, its inhibition also reduced the activity of key inflammatory and stress-related signaling pathways (MAPK and NF-κB) triggered by IL-1β, a cytokine known to be pivotal in OA pathogenesis. This indicates that GAB2 facilitates inflammatory responses in OA.

5. **In Vivo Evidence**: The in vivo study showed that reduced GAB2 expression delayed cartilage destruction in a mouse model of osteoarthritis induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus. This provides practical evidence that GAB2 not only is associated with OA but actively contributes to its progression.

6. **Therapeutic Potential of Targeting GAB2**: The conclusion that GAB2 is a potential therapeutic target for OA underscores its role in the disease. By identifying GAB2 as a target, the study implies that its expression and activity are sufficiently linked to OA outcomes to warrant intervention.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract supports the statement that GAB2 expression can contribute to osteoarthritis by detailing how GAB2 is involved in key processes related to OA pathogenesis, such as inflammatory responses and cartilage degradation, and by demonstrating that modulation of GAB2 expression can alter the course of the disease in experimental models. This makes GAB2 not only a marker of OA progression but also a potential contributor to its development and severity."	Osteoarthritis is a chronic age-related degenerative disease associated with varying degrees of pain and joint mobility disorders. Grb2-associated-Binding protein-2 (GAB2) is an intermediate molecule that plays a role downstream in a variety of signaling pathways, such as inflammatory signaling pathways. The role of GAB2 in the pathogenesis of OA has not been fully studied. In this study, we found that GAB2 expression was elevated in chondrocytes after constructing in vivo and in vitro models of OA. Inhibition of GAB2 by siRNA decreased the expression of MMP3, MMP13, iNOS, COX2, p62, and increased the expression of COL2, SOX9, ATG7, Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I. Furthermore, inhibition of GAB2 expression inhibited interleukin-1β (IL-1β) -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In vivo studies, we found that reduced GAB2 expression effectively delayed cartilage destruction in a mouse model of OA induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that GAB2 is a potential therapeutic target for OA.
36	35941362	Expression of ID1 has no correlation with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	ID1	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that the expression of ID1 has no correlation with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In fact, it provides strong evidence to the contrary, indicating that ID1 expression is significantly correlated with PDAC development and progression. Here's how the abstract provides this evidence:

1. **ID1 Expression Levels and PDAC Development**: The abstract reports that ID1 transcription levels were elevated specifically in association with PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. This direct association between increased ID1 expression and PDAC development suggests a significant correlation.

2. **Correlation with PDAC Malignancy**: Through pseudotime trajectory analysis, the study found that ID1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. This analysis method tracks changes in gene expression over time or developmental stages within a disease process, indicating that as PDAC becomes more malignant, ID1 expression increases.

3. **Comparative Analysis in Human Cells**: The gene expression patterns were analyzed by comparing scRNA-seq data from human PDAC tissues and normal pancreas tissues. The results showed dramatically increased ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells compared to normal epithelial cells, reinforcing the correlation of ID1 expression with PDAC in humans as well.

4. **Functional Impact of ID1 Deficiency**: Experimentally, ID1 deficiency in vitro led to a significant reduction in invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. This finding suggests that ID1 not only is associated with PDAC but also plays a functional role in enhancing the aggressive traits of the cancer.

5. **Regulation by EIF2 Signaling**: The study further identified EIF2 signaling as a core pathway regulating PDAC development, with blocking this pathway leading to decreased ID1 expression and attenuation of tumor-formation phenotypes. This indicates that ID1 is an integral part of the signaling mechanisms driving PDAC progression.

6. **Implications for Treatment**: The conclusion that ID1 acts as a potential malignant biomarker for PDAC and targeting it could be a promising strategy underscores the importance of ID1 in PDAC pathology. This suggests therapeutic potential in modulating ID1 expression or function to treat PDAC.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides compelling evidence that ID1 expression is significantly correlated with the development, progression, and malignancy of PDAC, contradicting the statement that there is no correlation between ID1 expression and PDAC. Instead, ID1 appears to be a critical determinant of PDAC pathology and a potential target for therapeutic intervention."	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease that has an increasing death rate but no effective treatment to now. Although biological and immunological hallmarks of PDAC have been frequently reported recently, early detection and the particularly aggressive biological features are the major challenges remaining unclear. In the current study, we retrieved multiple scRNA-seq datasets and illustrated the genetic programs of PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. Notably, the transcription levels of Id1 were elevated specifically along with the PDAC development. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that Id1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. The gene expression patterns of human PDAC cells were determined by the comparative analysis of the scRNA-seq data on human PDAC and normal pancreas tissues. ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells were dramatically increased compared to normal epithelial cells. ID1 deficiency in vitro significantly blunt the invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. IPA analysis on the differentially expressed genes suggested that EIF2 signaling was the core pathway regulating the development of PDAC. Blocking EFI2 signaling remarkably decreased the expression of ID1 and attenuated the tumor-formation related phenotypes. These observations confirmed that ID1 was regulated by EIF2 signaling and was the critical determinator of PDAC development and progression. This study suggests that ID1 is a potential malignant biomarker of PDAC in both mouse models and human and detecting and targeting ID1 may be a promising strategy to treat or even rescue PDAC.
37	31957231	Increased ID1 expression can induce diabetes	ID1	diabetes	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that increased ID1 expression can induce diabetes. Instead, it provides evidence that increased ID1 expression in endothelial cells may play a protective role against hyperglycemia-induced microvascular injury and diabetic nephropathy, which are complications associated with diabetes, rather than causes of diabetes itself. Here's how the abstract provides this evidence:

1. **Context and Hypothesis**: The abstract begins by contextualizing the role of the inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) in the normal physiological response to injury in kidney endothelial cells. It posits that endothelial Id1 might protect against hyperglycemia-induced microvascular damage, a common complication in diabetes.

2. **Experimental Design**: The researchers tested this hypothesis by inducing diabetes in Id1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates using streptozotocin, a compound that specifically damages insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, thereby inducing diabetes.

3. **Findings in Wild-Type vs. Knockout Mice**: In wild-type mice, Id1 expression in kidney endothelial cells increased significantly (15-fold) following the induction of diabetes, suggesting a reactive upregulation in response to hyperglycemic conditions. In contrast, Id1 knockout mice exhibited more severe diabetic complications, including increased mesangial and myofibroblast proliferation, more matrix deposition, and higher levels of albuminuria compared to wild-type mice. These findings indicate that Id1 plays a protective role in mitigating the vascular and tissue damage associated with diabetes.

4. **Additional Observations and Microarray Analysis**: Further observations such as endothelial cell injury, lumen narrowing, reduced capillary perfusion, and activation of senescence pathways in Id1 knockout mice underscore the protective functions of Id1 in maintaining endothelial cell integrity and function under diabetic conditions.

5. **Conclusion on Id1's Role**: The conclusion of the study is that endothelial Id1 upregulation in response to hyperglycemia acts protectively to prevent microvascular injury and senescence, thereby reducing the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy.

**Conclusion**: Instead of suggesting that increased Id1 expression can induce diabetes, the abstract indicates that Id1 upregulation is a compensatory, protective response against the vascular complications arising from diabetes. The absence of Id1 exacerbates the severity of diabetic complications, highlighting its role in protecting endothelial cell function under diabetic stress conditions. This study suggests targeting Id1 expression or function might be a viable therapeutic strategy to mitigate diabetic complications, rather than it being a causative factor in diabetes onset."	The inhibitor of differentiation (Id) transcription regulators, which are induced in response to oxidative stress, promote cell proliferation and inhibit senescence. Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) expression is limited to endothelial cells (EC) in the normal mouse kidney and is required for a normal response to injury. Endothelial dysfunction leads to the development of diabetic nephropathy, and so, we hypothesized that endothelial Id1 may help protect against hyperglycemia-induced microvascular injury and nephropathy. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using streptozotocin to induce diabetes in Id1 knockout (KO) mice and WT B6;129 littermates and examining the mice at 3 months. Expression of Id1 was observed to be increased 15-fold in WT kidney EC, and Id1 KO mice exhibited increased mesangial and myofibroblast proliferation, matrix deposition, and albuminuria compared with WT mice. Electron microscopy demonstrated peritubular capillary EC injury and lumen narrowing, and fluorescence microangiography showed a 45% reduction in capillary perfusion area with no reduction in CD31-stained areas in Id1 KO mice. Microarray analysis of EC isolated from WT and KO control and diabetic mice demonstrated activation of senescence pathways in KO cells. Kidneys from KO diabetic mice showed increased histological expression of senescence markers. In addition, premature senescence in cultured KO EC was also seen in response to oxidative stress. In conclusion, endothelial Id1 upregulation with hyperglycemia protects against microvascular injury and senescence and subsequent nephropathy.
38	7633410	Inversion of the IDS gene is the leading cause for Hunter Syndrome	IDS	Hunter Syndrome	0	"The biomedical abstract provides evidence that inversion of the IDS gene, due to recombination with a nearby IDS-2 locus, is a significant mechanism causing Hunter Syndrome, but it does not support the statement that it is the leading cause of the disease. Here’s an analysis of how the abstract relates to this topic:

1. **Prevalence of Recombination Events**: The abstract states that the recombination event involving the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus occurs in about 13% of patients with Hunter Syndrome. This percentage indicates that while this type of recombination is a clear contributor to the disease, it occurs in a minority of the cases.

2. **Nature of the Genetic Rearrangement**: It describes a specific genetic rearrangement where recombination results in the disruption of the IDS gene at intron 7, accompanied by an inversion of the intervening DNA. This disruption and inversion interfere with the normal function of the IDS gene, which is crucial for the breakdown of certain complex molecules in the body, leading to the symptoms of Hunter Syndrome.

3. **Recombination Hotspots**: The finding that all cases with this type of rearrangement involve recombination between specific regions (intron 7 of the IDS gene and near exon 3 at the IDS-2 locus) suggests that these areas are prone to recombination, making them significant for genetic analysis and diagnostics.

4. **Molecular Analysis**: Nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the inversion is due to recombination between homologous sequences in the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus. This detailed molecular insight confirms the mechanism behind this genetic alteration without indicating additional deletions or insertions.

5. **Implications for Diagnosis**: The study underscores the importance of recognizing this specific genetic rearrangement in the diagnosis of Hunter Syndrome, implying that genetic testing for this inversion could be crucial for accurate diagnosis in a subset of patients.

**Conclusion**: Although the recombination event described in the abstract is clearly implicated in the development of Hunter Syndrome in a subset of patients, the evidence does not suggest it is the leading cause of the disease. The statement that it occurs in about 13% of patients implies that other genetic mutations or mechanisms likely play a more predominant role in the majority of cases. Therefore, while the abstract supports the fact that IDS gene inversion is a cause of Hunter Syndrome, it does not establish it as the leading cause. Further research would be needed to determine the most common genetic changes causing the majority of Hunter Syndrome cases."	We have recently described the identification of a second IDS locus (IDS-2) located within 90 kb telomeric of the IDS gene (Bondeson et al. submitted). Here, we show that this region is involved in a recombination event with the IDS gene in about 13% of patients with the Hunter syndrome. Analysis of the resulting rearrangement at the molecular level showed that these patients have suffered a recombination event that results in a disruption of the IDS gene in intron 7 with an inversion of the intervening DNA. Interestingly, all of the six cases with a similar type of rearrangement showed recombination between intron 7 of the IDS gene and sequences close to exon 3 at the IDS-2 locus implying that these regions are hot spots for recombination. Analysis by nucleotide sequencing showed that the inversion is caused by recombination between homologous sequences present in the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus. No detectable deletions or insertions were observed as a result of the recombination event. The results in this study have practical implications for diagnosis of the Hunter syndrome.
39	36009479	A mutation in IRS1 is a significant risk factor for GDM	IRS1	GDM (Gestational diabetes mellitus)	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in IRS1 is a significant risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Instead, it suggests that while there may be some association between IRS1 polymorphisms and certain metabolic parameters in women with GDM, these polymorphisms are not overall significant risk factors for developing GDM. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Comparison of IRS1 Polymorphism Distribution**: The study did not find statistically significant differences in the distribution of the IRS1 rs2943641 polymorphism between women with GDM and those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). This indicates that the IRS1 polymorphism is not a major differentiator between these groups in terms of GDM risk.

2. **Association with Clinical Parameters**: The only notable finding related to IRS1 was that women with GDM who had the TT genotype showed higher fasting glucose levels compared to those with CC and TC genotypes. This suggests that while the IRS1 TT genotype may influence glucose levels, it is not sufficient alone to be considered a significant risk factor for GDM across the population studied.

3. **Placental Gene Expression**: There were no statistically significant differences in the expression levels of the IRS1 gene in the placenta between women with GDM and healthy controls. This further implies that IRS1 expression in the placenta does not contribute significantly to the risk of developing GDM.

4. **Correlation with BMI**: The expression of IRS1 in the placenta correlated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy in women with GDM. While this shows some metabolic impact, it does not directly support IRS1 as a risk factor for GDM but rather highlights its possible role in broader metabolic changes during pregnancy.

5. **Conclusion of the Study**: The study concludes that IRS1 rs2943641 polymorphism is not a significant risk factor for GDM. This conclusion is based on the statistical analysis of genetic distribution and association with clinical parameters, which did not show strong links to the risk of developing GDM.

**Summary**: Overall, the study's findings suggest that while the IRS1 polymorphism might influence certain metabolic parameters in women with GDM, it does not confer a significant risk for the development of GDM itself. The study refutes the statement that a mutation in IRS1 is a significant risk factor for GDM, highlighting the complexity of genetic influences on this condition."	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance in pregnant women leading to various complications. Currently, there is a search for factors predisposing to GDM. Among them are genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in insulin secretion as well as carbohydrate metabolism. Due to the similar pathogenesis of GDM to type 2 diabetes (T2DM), genetic polymorphisms associated with T2DM are considered. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between the COBLL1 rs7607980 T > C and IRS1 rs2943641 T > C gene polymorphisms and the risk of GDM as well as selected clinical parameters in women with GDM. Additionally, we examined the expression of these genes in the placenta of women with and without GDM in correlation with selected clinical parameters. This study included 328 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 251 pregnant women with GDM diagnosed on the basis of a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24−28 weeks gestation. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of IRS1 rs2943641 gene polymorphisms between women with GDM and pregnant women with NGT. In the GDM group, we observed a decreased frequency of COBLL1 rs7607980 CC homozygous women (CC vs. TC+TT, p = 0.048); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of alleles between women with GDM and the control group. There were no statistically significant associations between COBLL1 rs7607980 gene polymorphism and clinical parameters in women with GDM. In GDM women with the IRS1 rs2943641 TT genotype, fasting glucose levels were significantly higher than in women with CC and TC genotypes. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of COBLL1 and IRS1 genes in the placenta between women with GDM and healthy women. There were no statistically significant correlations between COBLL1 gene expression in the placenta and clinical parameters. The expression of IRS1 correlated significantly with an increase in BMI during pregnancy. The results of this study suggest that COBLL1 rs7607980 and IRS1 rs2943641 gene polymorphisms are not significant risk factors for GDM in our population. The IRS1 TT genotype may be associated with higher fasting glucose levels in women with GDM. Expression of the IRS1 gene in the placenta positively correlates with an increase in BMI during pregnancy in women with GDM.
40	25606440	Mutations in IRS1 will not have any affect on insulin resistance	IRS1	Insulin Resistance	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in IRS1 will not have any effect on insulin resistance. Instead, it provides a nuanced view that specific IRS1 polymorphisms (Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro) studied did not show an association with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes risk in a particular population (non-obese Turkish individuals), but this does not generalize the effect of all possible mutations in the IRS1 gene on insulin resistance. Here’s how the abstract relates to this topic:

1. **Role of IRS1 in Insulin Signaling**: The abstract starts by emphasizing the critical role of IRS1 in insulin signaling, which is foundational in the development of insulin resistance. This establishes IRS1 as a key player in metabolic pathways relevant to diabetes and insulin sensitivity.

2. **Specific IRS1 Variants Studied**: The focus of the study was on the Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants of IRS1, selected because of their proximity to important tyrosine motifs involved in insulin signaling pathways. These specific locations suggest a potential impact on the protein's function and its interaction with downstream effectors.

3. **Study Findings**: The study did not find a statistically significant association between the two specific IRS1 polymorphisms and the risk of type 2 diabetes or its related phenotypes in the study population. This suggests that in this particular context (non-obese Turkish individuals), these IRS1 variants do not contribute to diabetes or directly relate to observable changes in insulin resistance.

4. **Generalization of Results**: While these specific findings indicate no effect of the Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants on insulin resistance or diabetes in this population, they do not necessarily imply that other mutations in the IRS1 gene would not affect insulin resistance. The IRS1 gene can have other variants not studied here, which could have different impacts on insulin signaling and resistance.

5. **Contrast with Other Studies**: The abstract acknowledges that IRS1 and its variants are associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in several other studies worldwide. This admission underscores the variability in genetic influences across different populations and suggests that the findings from this study might not be universally applicable.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract supports the understanding that while specific mutations (Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro) in the IRS1 gene did not influence insulin resistance or diabetes risk in a specific population, this does not rule out the potential effects of other IRS1 mutations or their impact in other populations. Therefore, the statement that mutations in IRS1 will not have any effect on insulin resistance is too broad and not supported by this abstract, which only addresses specific variants in a particular demographic group."	Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), plays a critical role in insulin signaling and its control has an important place in the development of insulin resistance. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 serves as docking molecules for downstream effectors such as Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase-2. We focused on the Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants of the IRS1 gene, since these specific allelic variants are located near the Tyr-Met-X-Met (YMXM) motifs around Tyr987 and Tyr612. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphisms in IRS1 gene on development of insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a non-obese Turkish population. This work included 306 individuals comprising 178 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 128 healthy subjects matched for body mass index. Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphisms had no effect on type 2 diabetes risk and its phenotypes (P > 0.05). Although IRS1 gene and its variants are associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in several studies worldwide, our data showed that there is no association between Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants in IRS1 and disease in Turkish population.
41	31479860	Increased expression of ITPK1 can lead to slower cognitive decline	ITPK1	Cognitive decline	1	"The biomedical abstract directly supports the statement that increased expression of ITPK1 can lead to slower cognitive decline. Here’s how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Study Context and Purpose**: The study explored the relationships between four specific proteins (AK4, ITPK1, HSPB2, and IGFBP5) and cognitive function in older adults, aiming to determine how these relationships might be influenced by microstructural changes in the brain, as measured by postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metrics (reciprocal of transverse relaxation time, R2).

2. **Specific Findings on ITPK1**: According to the abstract, higher abundance of the ITPK1 protein was associated with slower cognitive decline. This association is particularly significant as it suggests that increased levels of ITPK1 may have a protective effect on cognitive function over time.

3. **Mechanism of Action**: The beneficial impact of ITPK1 on cognitive decline was mediated through higher postmortem R2 in the frontal and temporal white matter regions of the brain. Higher R2 values typically indicate better microstructural integrity, implying that ITPK1 might contribute to maintaining or enhancing the structural integrity of brain regions that are crucial for cognitive functioning.

4. **Contrast with Other Proteins**: The abstract notes that while other proteins studied (AK4, HSPB2, and IGFBP5) were associated with faster cognitive decline through lower postmortem R2 values in similar brain regions, ITPK1 showed a contrasting effect. This differentiation highlights the unique and potentially beneficial role of ITPK1 in cognitive aging.

5. **Implications for Cognitive Health in Late Life**: The findings suggest that ITPK1’s impact on cognitive function is not random but linked to observable changes in brain structure, which provides a plausible biological pathway for how ITPK1 influences cognitive decline. This mechanistic insight strengthens the claim that ITPK1 has a protective role against cognitive deterioration.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that increased expression of ITPK1 is associated with slower cognitive decline in older adults, mediated by positive changes in brain microstructure. This supports the statement that increased expression of ITPK1 can lead to slower cognitive decline, underscoring its potential significance as a biomarker or target for interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function in the aging population."	The associations of 4 proteins-AK4, ITPK1, HSPB2, and IGFBP5-with cognitive function in older adults were largely unexplained by known brain pathologies. We examined the extent to which individual protein associations with cognitive decline were attributable to microstructural changes in the brain. This study included 521 participants (mean age 90.3, 65.9-108.3) with the postmortem reciprocal of transverse relaxation time (R<sub>2</sub>) magnetic resonance image. All participants came from one of the 2 ongoing longitudinal cohorts of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. Higher abundance of AK4, HSPB2, and IGFBP5 was associated with faster cognitive decline and mediated through lower postmortem R<sub>2</sub> in the frontal and temporal white matter regions. In contrast, higher abundance of ITPK1 was associated with slower cognitive decline and mediated through higher postmortem R<sub>2</sub> in the frontal and temporal white matter regions. The associations of 4 proteins-AK4, ITPK1, IGFBP5, and HSPB2-with cognition in late life were explained via microstructural changes in the brain.
42	31059310	Peficitinib could be a treatment option for Rheumatoid arthritis	Peficitinib	Rheumatoid arthritis	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that peficitinib could be a treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Context and Need for New Treatments**: The introduction outlines the context of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, highlighting that while there are several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available, some patients either do not respond to these treatments or cannot take them due to adverse reactions. This sets the stage for the introduction of new treatment options.

2. **Role of JAK Inhibitors**: It notes the potential of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in providing significant breakthroughs in RA treatment. JAK inhibitors, including peficitinib, are described as potent and orally administered, which simplifies the treatment regimen for patients.

3. **Specifics about Peficitinib**: The abstract discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of peficitinib, emphasizing its role as a novel JAK3 inhibitor. Peficitinib's ability to inhibit JAK3 enzymatic activity and JAK1/3-mediated cell proliferation positions it as a promising therapeutic option.

4. **Comparative Efficacy and Selectivity**: Peficitinib's selectivity for JAK family kinases is compared to that of tofacitinib, another JAK inhibitor, noting that peficitinib is slightly less potent for JAK2 but similar in its overall selectivity. This comparison helps to contextualize peficitinib within the broader category of JAK inhibitors.

5. **Regulatory Evaluation**: The abstract mentions that peficitinib is currently being evaluated by the FDA for treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate. This ongoing regulatory review underscores its potential entry into clinical use.

6. **Usage and Combination Therapy**: It is highlighted that peficitinib can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs, which provides flexibility in how it might be integrated into existing treatment regimens.

7. **Safety Considerations**: While supporting peficitinib as a treatment option, the abstract also calls for cautious consideration and monitoring for adverse events, reflecting a balanced view on its introduction based on safety results from ongoing clinical studies.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides substantial evidence supporting the potential of peficitinib as a treatment option for RA, particularly for patients who are nonresponsive or intolerant to other treatments. By discussing its mechanisms, comparative efficacy, regulatory status, and flexible application in treatment regimens, the abstract effectively supports the statement that peficitinib could be a viable treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis."	<b>Introduction</b>: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease characterized by synovitis as well as symmetric and destructive arthropathy. Although several disease modified antirheumatic-drugs (DMARDs) have widely used in clinical practice, certain patients are nonresponsive to or cannot take such medications due to adverse reactions. It is evident that Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have the potential to provide a significant breakthrough in the treatment of RA. These potent, orally administered, JAK inhibitors simplify the treatment options for patients. <b>Areas covered</b>: We discuss the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of peficitinib for the treatment of RA. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Peficitinib is a novel JAK3 inhibitor potently inhibiting JAK3 enzymatic activity and JAK1/3-mediated cell proliferation. Its selectivity for JAK family kinases is similar to that of tofacitinib, but slightly less potent for JAK2. It is currently being evaluated by the FDA to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who show inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate. It can be used either as monotherapy or combination therapy with methotrexate, or other DMARDs. However, we think that more cautious consideration and measurement for adverse events are needed, after considering the safety results of ongoing clinical studies of peficitinib.
43	37830594	A mutation in JAK3 contributes to the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL)	JAK3	Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL)	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that a mutation in JAK3 contributes to the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), particularly through the identification and characterization of a JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript. Here's a detailed analysis of how the abstract substantiates this statement:

1. **Role of JAK3 in CTCL**: The abstract begins by acknowledging that constitutively activated JAK3 is implicated in the pathogenesis of CTCL, setting the groundwork that JAK3 is involved in this disease. This initial statement links JAK3 activity directly to CTCL.

2. **Identification of JAK3 Mutation**: It mentions that mechanisms of JAK3 activation are not fully understood, though mutations, including a newly identified JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript, have been reported in a subset of CTCL patients. This suggests that alterations in the JAK3 gene, specifically through fusion with another gene (INSL3), could be a contributing factor in the disease's development.

3. **Experimental Focus on JAK3-INSL3 Fusion**: The study focuses on this fusion transcript's role in CTCL. By using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, the research identifies the presence of this fusion in malignant T-cells from patients with Sézary syndrome, a severe form of CTCL. The specific investigation into this fusion transcript underscores its importance in the context of CTCL.

4. **Association with Clinical Outcomes**: The expression levels of the JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript were correlated with patient survival outcomes, revealing that high levels of expression are associated with poorer 5-year survival rates. This direct correlation between the fusion transcript levels and clinical severity supports the notion that the JAK3 mutation through this fusion contributes significantly to the disease pathology and impacts patient prognosis.

5. **Functional Studies in Cell Lines**: Knockdown and knockout assays in CTCL cell lines showed that reducing the expression of the JAK3-INSL3 fusion led to decreased cell proliferation and colony formation. This functional evidence supports the fusion's role in driving oncogenic activity in CTCL cells.

6. **In Vivo Validation**: The use of NSG xenograft mice models further validated the oncogenic role of the JAK3-INSL3 fusion. Mice with cells transduced with shRNAs targeting the fusion transcript exhibited smaller tumor sizes compared to controls, providing strong in vivo evidence of the fusion's contribution to tumorigenesis.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides compelling evidence that mutations in JAK3, specifically the JAK3-INSL3 fusion, are significant contributors to the pathogenesis of CTCL. This supports the statement that a mutation in JAK3 contributes to the disease, highlighting the fusion as a critical oncogenic event in CTCL."	Constitutively activated tyrosine kinase JAK3 is implicated in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). The mechanisms of constitutive JAK3 activation are unknown although a <i>JAK3</i> mutation was reported in a small portion of CTCL patients. In this study, we assessed the oncogenic roles of a newly identified <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript in CTCL. Total RNA from malignant T-cells in 33 patients with Sézary syndrome (SS), a leukemic form of CTCL, was examined for the new <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript by RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. The expression levels were assessed by qPCR and correlated with patient survivals. Knockdown and/or knockout assays were conducted in two CTCL cell lines (MJ cells and HH cells) by RNA interference and/or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. SS patients expressed heterogeneous levels of a new <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript. Patients with high-level expression of <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> showed poorer 5-year survival (n = 19, 42.1%) than patients with low-level expression (n = 14, 78.6%). CTCL cells transduced with specific shRNAs or sgRNAs had decreased new <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript expression, reduced cell proliferation, and decreased colony formation. In NSG xenograft mice, smaller tumor sizes were observed in MJ cells transduced with specific shRNAs than cells transduced with controls. Our results suggest that the newly identified <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript confers an oncogenic event in CTCL.
44	38177135	Restricted activity of LKB1 can lead to lung cancer	LKB1	Lung cancer	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that restricted activity of LKB1 can lead to lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of LKB1 in NSCLC**: The abstract discusses the function of LKB1 as an important tumor suppressor that is generally inactivated in NSCLC. This initial information sets the stage by highlighting the relevance of LKB1 in the context of lung cancer pathogenesis.

2. **Mechanism Involving JOSD2 and LKB1**: The abstract explains that the Josephin Domain-containing protein 2 (JOSD2) restricts the kinase activity of LKB1 by removing K6-linked polyubiquitination from LKB1. This modification is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex, which is essential for the tumor suppressive function of LKB1.

3. **Consequences of Restricted LKB1 Activity**: By showing that JOSD2 inhibits LKB1 activity, the abstract indicates that interference with LKB1's function can promote NSCLC growth. This suggests that any factor, such as JOSD2 overexpression, that limits LKB1 activity can contribute to the progression and severity of lung cancer.

4. **Impact of JOSD2 Inhibition on NSCLC**: The discovery and application of a small-molecule inhibitor of JOSD2, which led to the significant arrest of NSCLC proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, further supports the idea that enhancing LKB1 activity (by inhibiting JOSD2) can provide therapeutic benefits. This part of the study underscores the negative impact of restricted LKB1 activity on lung cancer and suggests that restoring LKB1 function can be a viable strategy for treating NSCLC.

5. **Therapeutic Implications**: The abstract presents the inhibition of JOSD2, and thereby the facilitation of LKB1 activity, as a promising strategy for NSCLC treatment. This highlights the critical role of LKB1 activity in NSCLC and supports the notion that compromised LKB1 activity, due to its regulation by JOSD2, is associated with lung cancer development.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides evidence that restricted activity of LKB1, mediated through its regulation by JOSD2, can contribute to the pathogenesis of NSCLC. By linking JOSD2's regulation of LKB1 to poor prognosis in NSCLC and showing that pharmacological targeting of this pathway can inhibit cancer proliferation, the abstract supports the statement that restricted activity of LKB1 can lead to lung cancer."	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ranks as one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the prominence and effectiveness of kinase-target therapies in NSCLC treatment, these drugs are suitable for and beneficial to a mere ~30% of NSCLC patients. Consequently, the need for novel strategies addressing NSCLC remains pressing. Deubiquitinases (DUBs), a group of diverse enzymes with well-defined catalytic sites that are frequently overactivated in cancers and associated with tumorigenesis and regarded as promising therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which DUBs promote NSCLC remain poorly understood. Through a global analysis of the 97 DUBs' contribution to NSCLC survival possibilities using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that high expression of Josephin Domain-containing protein 2 (JOSD2) predicted the poor prognosis of patients. Depletion of JOSD2 significantly impeded NSCLC growth in both cell/patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Mechanically, we found that JOSD2 restricts the kinase activity of LKB1, an important tumor suppressor generally inactivated in NSCLC, by removing K6-linked polyubiquitination, an action vital for maintaining the integrity of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex. Notably, we identified the first small-molecule inhibitor of JOSD2, and observed that its pharmacological inhibition significantly arrested NSCLC proliferation in vitro/in vivo. Our findings highlight the vital role of JOSD2 in hindering LKB1 activity, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting JOSD2 in NSCLC, especially in those with inactivated LKB1, and presenting its inhibitors as a promising strategy for NSCLC treatment.
45	32240302	Increased expression of JUND can lead to greater resistance to cisplatin	JUND	Cisplatin	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that increased expression of JUND can lead to greater resistance to cisplatin. Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Context and Problem Statement**: The abstract begins by highlighting the standard treatment for metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with platinum-based chemotherapy, specifically cisplatin (CDDP), and notes the major issue of acquired resistance to this treatment.

2. **JUND Expression and Cisplatin Resistance**: It reports that expression of JUND, part of the activator protein-1 family, is significantly induced in cisplatin-resistant MIBC cases. This finding directly associates higher levels of JUND with reduced effectiveness of cisplatin, suggesting that JUND might be involved in mechanisms that confer resistance to the drug.

3. **Clinical and Survival Data**: The study notes an association between nuclear accumulation of JUND and lower post-chemotherapy survival rates in MIBC patients, which underscores the clinical relevance of JUND expression in affecting treatment outcomes.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The abstract describes experiments using genetically engineered cell models and murine xenograft models, which provided evidence that bladder cancer cells with high JUND expression were less responsive to cisplatin treatment. This experimental data confirms the role of JUND in mediating resistance at the cellular level.

5. **Mechanism of Resistance**: The resistance mediated by JUND is linked to the transactivation of HMOX1, which encodes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a key enzyme in antioxidant signaling pathways that help cells adapt to stress. This pathway is particularly relevant in the context of chemotherapy resistance, as it can protect cancer cells from the oxidative damage typically induced by drugs like cisplatin.

6. **Specific Genetic Evidence**: A mutation within the HMOX1 promoter that abolished oxidative stress-enhanced and JUND-driven promoter activation was identified, highlighting a specific site where JUND interacts to induce HO-1 expression maximally in the context of cisplatin treatment. This detailed molecular insight further solidifies the role of JUND in fostering a cellular environment conducive to resisting cisplatin effects.

7. **Conclusion and Implications for Treatment**: By concluding that JUND plays an indispensable role in conferring adaptive responses during the development of cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer, the abstract supports targeting JUND or related pathways as a potential strategy to overcome or mitigate this resistance.

**Overall**, the abstract provides robust evidence linking increased expression of JUND to enhanced resistance to cisplatin in bladder cancer, thus supporting the statement. The findings suggest that JUND could be a valuable target for therapeutic intervention to improve cisplatin efficacy in resistant cancer types."	The standard-of-care for metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Acquired resistance that occurs frequently through unidentified mechanisms, however, remains the major obstacle for implementing therapeutic effectiveness. Here, using data mining and analysis on clinical samples, we show that expression of JUND, a core component of activator protein-1 family, was significantly induced in cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant MIBC. Accumulation of nuclear JUND was associated with low post-chemotherapy survival in MIBC patients. In both genetically engineered cell models and murine xenograft models, we provided evidence that bladder cancer (BC) cells with excessive JUND expression were less responsive to CDDP treatment. This CDDP resistance was further demonstrated to be mediated, at least in part, by transactivation of HMOX1 [the gene encoding heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], one of the most important antioxidant signalling pathways of cell adaptation to stress. One mutation within the HMOX1 promoter successfully abolished oxidative stress-enhanced and JUND-driven HMOX1 promoter activation, suggesting that this unique site synergized for maximal HO-1 induction in CDDP-challenged BC cells. Overall, our data highlight an indispensible role of JUND, both as a target as a modifier of the oxidative stress signalling, in conferring an adaptive response during the pathogenesis of CDDP resistance in MIBC.
46	33950226	 Tofacitinib is an effectve treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease	Tofacitinib 	inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that tofacitinib is an effective treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly for ulcerative colitis. Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this:

1. **Context and Need for New Treatments**: The abstract begins by highlighting the issues of primary non-response and secondary loss of response to current treatments in a significant proportion of IBD patients. This sets the stage for the introduction and need for new therapeutic options such as tofacitinib.

2. **Role of JAK-STAT Pathway in IBD**: It notes that the JAK-STAT pathway, a crucial signaling pathway in many biological processes including immune response and inflammation, has been extensively studied in the context of IBD. The targeting of this pathway represents a strategic approach to managing IBD.

3. **Specific Mention of Tofacitinib**: Tofacitinib is specifically mentioned as a JAK1 inhibitor that is licensed for use in the induction and maintenance of ulcerative colitis, one of the main forms of IBD. This official approval underscores its recognized effectiveness and safety within this particular patient population.

4. **Evidence from Clinical Trials**: Although the abstract does not detail specific results from clinical trials, it does mention that the current evidence from clinical trials supports the use of JAK1 inhibitors, including tofacitinib, in IBD treatment. This implies that clinical trial data have been favorable enough to support its use and licensing.

5. **Impact on Treatment Pathways**: The abstract also suggests that the introduction of small molecule drugs like tofacitinib is set to challenge and possibly enhance current treatment pathways for IBD, reflecting a shift towards more ambitious therapeutic outcomes in clinical practice.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides a supportive context for the use of tofacitinib as an effective treatment option for IBD, particularly noting its approval for managing ulcerative colitis. It highlights the drug's role within the broader evolution of treatment strategies for this complex and variable group of disorders, emphasizing the positive impact it is expected to have on managing the disease."	Primary non-response and secondary loss of response remain a significant issue with the currently available treatment options for a significant proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are multiple unmet needs in the IBD treatment algorithm and new treatment options are required. As our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD evolves, new therapeutic targets are being identified. The JAK-STAT pathway has been extensively studied. Tofacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, is now licensed for use in the induction and maintenance of ulcerative colitis and there are a large number of molecules currently under investigation. These new small molecule drugs (SMDs) will challenge current treatment pathways at a time when clinical therapeutic outcomes are rapidly evolving and becoming more ambitious. This is a review of the current JAK1 inhibitors in IBD including the current evidence from clinical trials.
47	31692920	Baricitinib is a safe and effective treatment option for Rheumatoid arthritis	Baricitinib 	Rheumatoid arthritis	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that baricitinib is a safe and effective treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this:

1. **Context and Need for Advanced Treatments**: The abstract begins by noting the chronic and complex nature of RA and the continuous need for effective treatments due to the persistence of unmet clinical needs among RA patients. This establishes the importance of finding additional effective therapeutic options.

2. **Introduction of JAK Inhibitors**: The abstract mentions that significant advancements in RA management have come through the development of new drug classes, specifically targeting the disease's inflammatory processes. It highlights Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors as a critical development in this area.

3. **Specific Mention of Baricitinib**: Baricitinib, alongside tofacitinib, is specifically noted as being licensed for the treatment of RA following a ""very favorable profile observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted across different RA subpopulations."" This direct mention emphasizes its regulatory approval based on positive clinical trial outcomes, which is a strong endorsement of its efficacy.

4. **Safety and Efficacy Profile**: While the abstract discusses the push towards more selective JAK inhibitors to potentially enhance the safety profile, the mention of a very favorable profile for baricitinib in RCTs implies that it already meets a significant threshold for safety and effectiveness as required for its clinical use.

5. **Role of Baricitinib in the Treatment Landscape**: The licensing of baricitinib for RA treatment and its inclusion in discussions of advanced therapeutic options suggest its established role in the current RA treatment landscape. The mention of its use across different subpopulations also suggests broad applicability and effectiveness.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract supports the statement that baricitinib is a safe and effective treatment option for RA by pointing to its successful outcomes in clinical trials and its approval for clinical use. It positions baricitinib as part of a significant advancement in RA management, specifically within the newer class of JAK inhibitors that target key pathways in RA pathogenesis."	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by joint involvement, extra-articular manifestations, comorbidities, and increased mortality. In the last few decades, the management of RA has been dramatically improved by the introduction of a treat-to-target approach aiming to prevent joint damage progression. Moreover, the increasing knowledge about disease pathogenesis allowed the development of a new drug class of biologic agents targeted on immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines involved in RA network. Despite the introduction of several targeted drugs, a significant proportion of RA patients still fail to achieve the clinical target; so, more recently the focus of research has been shifted toward the inhibition of kinases involved in the transduction of the inflammatory signal into immune cells. In particular, two Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, baricitinib and tofacitinib, have been licensed for the treatment of RA as a consequence of a very favorable profile observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted across different RA subpopulations. Both these new compounds are active on the majority of four JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2), whereas the most recent emerging approach is directed toward the development of JAK1 selective inhibitors (upadacitinib and filgotinib) with the aim to improve the safety profile by minimizing the effects on JAK3 and, especially, JAK2. In this narrative review, we discuss the rationale for JAK inhibition in RA, with a special focus on the role of JAK1 selective blockade and a detailed description of available data from the results of clinical trials on upadacitinib and filgotinib.
48	10510981	A mutation in JRK can cause childhood absence epilepsy	JRK	Childhood absence epilepsy	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that a mutation in JRK can cause childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Instead, it provides evidence that effectively rules out JRK as the gene responsible for ECA1, a specific locus associated with CAE. Here's how the abstract arrives at this conclusion:

1. **Background and Hypothesis**: The abstract starts by acknowledging the genetic heterogeneity of CAE and identifies a specific genetic locus, ECA1 on chromosome 8q24, previously linked to the condition. The JRK/JH8 gene, a human homologue of the mouse jerky gene associated with epilepsy, is located on this chromosome and was considered a candidate for being the CAE gene due to its phenotypic and locational attributes.

2. **Genetic Analysis**: To test the hypothesis that JRK/JH8 might be responsible for ECA1, mutational analysis was performed on the coding region of JRK/JH8 in families with CAE mapped to 8q24. The methods used included heteroduplex and direct sequencing, which are suitable for identifying nucleotide changes that could be linked to the disease.

3. **Results of the Mutational Analysis**: The analysis identified seven nucleotide changes in the JRK/JH8 gene, including two that led to amino acid substitutions. However, crucially, these changes did not co-segregate with the disease phenotype within the families studied. This means that the presence of these mutations did not consistently appear in all individuals affected by CAE, weakening the case for JRK/JH8 as the causal gene.

4. **Physical Mapping**: Further undermining the hypothesis, the physical mapping of the JRK/JH8 gene indicated that it is located more than 4 megabases away from the previously identified ECA1 locus. This significant distance makes it unlikely that mutations in JRK/JH8 are responsible for the CAE cases linked to the ECA1 locus.

5. **Conclusion of the Study**: The study concludes that JRK/JH8 is not the gene responsible for ECA1, based on the negative results from the mutation analyses and the gene's physical location relative to the ECA1 locus.

**Conclusion**: The evidence provided in the abstract strongly suggests that JRK/JH8 does not cause CAE, specifically in the context of the ECA1 locus. This conclusion is based on the lack of co-segregation of identified mutations with the disease phenotype and the geographic discrepancy between the gene's location and the ECA1 locus.

Thus, the statement that a mutation in JRK can cause childhood absence epilepsy is not supported by the findings presented in this abstract."	Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), one of the most common epilepsies in children, is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. One of the genes responsible for human CAE associated with tonic-clonic seizures has been mapped to chromosome band 8q24 by genetic linkage analysis and is termed ECA1. Recently, we isolated and mapped the JRK/JH8 gene, a human homologue of the mouse epilepsy gene, jerky, on 8q24. The epilepsy phenotype of the mice with inactivated jerky gene as well as its chromosomal localization proposed JRK/JH8 as a prominent candidate for the CAE gene. To confirm whether the JRK/JH8 gene is responsible for ECA1, we performed mutational analyses in the coding region of JRK/JH8 in two CAE families mapped on 8q24, using heteroduplex and direct sequencing methods. We identified seven nucleotide changes, two of which lead to amino acid substitutions. However, these changes did not co-segregate with the disease phenotype. In addition, we redefined the location of JRK/JH8 to be more than 4 Mb distant from D8S502 and ECA1. Thus, negative results of mutation analyses and detailed physical mapping exclude JRK/JH8 as the ECA1 gene.
49	17509612	A mutation in JPH2 can lead to pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	JPH2	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that a mutation in JPH2 can lead to the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here's a detailed analysis of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of JPH2 in Cardiac Function**: The abstract introduces JPH2 (junctophilin-2) as a crucial protein in cardiac function, describing its role in connecting the L-type calcium channel and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor. This connection is essential for calcium-induced calcium release, a critical process in cardiac muscle contraction.

2. **Findings from JPH2 Knockout Mice**: The abstract mentions that knockout mice lacking JPH2 showed disrupted calcium transients and altered junctional membrane complex formation, which led to cardiomyopathy and embryonic lethality. These findings in animal models highlight the essential role of JPH2 in maintaining normal cardiac function and structural integrity.

3. **Gene Expression in Disease Models**: It notes that JPH2 gene expression is down-regulated in murine models of cardiomyopathy, further linking alterations in JPH2 expression or function with cardiac pathology.

4. **Mutational Analysis in Human Patients**: The core of the abstract details a comprehensive mutational analysis of JPH2 in a large cohort of patients with HCM. This analysis identified three novel mutations associated with HCM that were not found in control groups, directly implicating these mutations in the disease.

5. **Functional Characterization of Mutations**: Each of the identified mutations was functionally characterized and found to cause reorganization of the JPH2 protein, disturbances in intracellular calcium signaling, and cardiomyocyte hyperplasia. These functional impairments are consistent with mechanisms known to contribute to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

6. **Establishment of a New Disease Association**: The abstract concludes by stating that the evidence establishes HCM as the first human disease associated with genetic defects in JPH2, based on molecular and functional data. This is a significant finding, linking JPH2 mutations directly to HCM pathogenesis.

7. **Implications for Further Research**: It suggests that mutations in JPH2 might also be implicated in other forms of cardiomyopathy, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, indicating broader potential implications of JPH2 in cardiac diseases.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides compelling evidence that mutations in JPH2 are not only associated with but also causative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in humans. This evidence is supported by detailed genetic and functional studies linking JPH2 dysfunction to fundamental pathological processes in HCM. Thus, the statement that a mutation in JPH2 can lead to the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is strongly supported by the findings presented in this abstract."	Junctophilin-2 (JPH2) is a cardiac specific member of the junctophilins, a newly characterized family of junctional membrane complex proteins important in physically approximating the plasmalemmal L-type calcium channel and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor for calcium-induced calcium release. JPH2 knockout mice showed disrupted calcium transients, altered junctional membrane complex formation, cardiomyopathy, and embryonic lethality. Furthermore, JPH2 gene expression is down-regulated in murine cardiomyopathy models. To this end, we explored JPH2 as a novel candidate gene for the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in humans. Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing, comprehensive open reading frame/splice site mutational analysis of JPH2 was performed on DNA obtained from 388 unrelated patients with HCM. HCM-associated JPH2 mutations were engineered and functionally characterized using immunocytochemistry, cell morphometry measurements, and live cell confocal calcium imaging. Three novel HCM-susceptibility mutations: S101R, Y141H and S165F, which localize to key functional domains, were discovered in 3/388 unrelated patients with HCM and were absent in 1000 ethnic-matched reference alleles. Functionally, each human mutation caused (i) protein reorganization of junctophilin-2, (ii) perturbations in intracellular calcium signaling, and (iii) marked cardiomyocyte hyperplasia. The molecular and functional evidence implicates defective junctophilin-2 and disrupted calcium signaling as a novel pathogenic mechanism for HCM and establishes HCM as the first human disease associated with genetic defects in JPH2. Whether susceptibility for other cardiomyopathies, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, can be conferred by mutations in JPH2 warrants investigation.
50	34423300	Mutations in LAMA1 correlate with Joubert Syndrome	LAMA1	Joubert Syndrome	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in LAMA1 correlate with Joubert Syndrome. Instead, it establishes that mutations in LAMA1 are associated with a different, though somewhat similar, condition known as Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Here’s a breakdown of the abstract’s findings and how they relate to the statement:

1. **Diagnosis and Genetic Findings**: The abstract describes the investigation of several families that were initially considered to have Joubert syndrome based on clinical diagnoses. However, genetic analysis did not support this; instead, pathogenic variants in LAMA1 were detected, which are associated with Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome, not Joubert syndrome.

2. **Radiological Differences**: The patients did not exhibit the ""molar tooth sign"" on brain MRI, which is a hallmark of Joubert syndrome. Instead, they showed cerebellar dysplasia and cerebellar cysts, features typical of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. This further differentiates the two conditions and highlights the importance of precise radiological assessment in distinguishing between them.

3. **Implications for Genetic Testing**: The researchers advocate for the inclusion of LAMA1 genetic testing in panels for intellectual disability and Joubert syndrome due to the potential for clinical overlap and misdiagnosis, indicating that while LAMA1 mutations do not cause Joubert syndrome, they are important in the differential diagnosis of similar syndromes.

4. **Prevalence Data**: The abstract provides prevalence data, underscoring the rarity of both conditions but does not link LAMA1 mutations to Joubert syndrome. Instead, it emphasizes the need for awareness and accurate diagnosis of related but distinct conditions.

5. **Conclusion on Misdiagnosis**: The conclusion about delayed diagnoses due to poor recognition of key radiological features and the absence of LAMA1 in genetic testing panels further supports the notion that while LAMA1-related conditions may mimic Joubert syndrome, they are genetically and clinically distinct.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract clarifies that mutations in LAMA1 are linked to Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome and not Joubert syndrome, thus refuting the statement that mutations in LAMA1 correlate with Joubert syndrome. This distinction is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of these pediatric neurology syndromes."	Paediatric neurology syndromes are a broad and complex group of conditions with a large spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Joubert syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous neurological ciliopathy syndrome with molar tooth sign as the neuroimaging hallmark. We reviewed the clinical, radiological and genetic data for several families with a clinical diagnosis of Joubert syndrome but negative genetic analysis. We detected biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>LAMA1</i>, including novel alleles, in each of the four cases we report, thereby establishing a firm diagnosis of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Analysis of brain MRI revealed cerebellar dysplasia and cerebellar cysts, associated with Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome and the absence of typical molar tooth signs. Using large UK patient cohorts, the relative prevalence of Joubert syndrome as a cause of intellectual disability was 0.2% and of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome was 0.02%. We conclude that children with congenital brain disorders that mimic Joubert syndrome may have a delayed diagnosis due to poor recognition of key features on brain imaging and the lack of inclusion of <i>LAMA1</i> on molecular genetic gene panels. We advocate the inclusion of <i>LAMA1</i> genetic analysis on all intellectual disability and Joubert syndrome gene panels and promote a wider awareness of the clinical and radiological features of these syndromes.
51	29805427	TGFB1 gene polymorphism correlates to myopia	TGFB1	myopia	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that TGFB1 gene polymorphism correlates with myopia. Here’s why:

1. **Study Objective and Population**: The study's objective was to investigate the genetic basis of high myopia by examining polymorphisms in the TGFB1 and LAMA1 genes among children with high myopia and a control group of emmetropic children.

2. **Genetic Analysis Results**: The results indicated that both groups (myopic and control) exhibited similar frequencies of heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the TGFB1 gene. Specifically, the frequencies of heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the study group were 43.2% and 13.5%, respectively. In the control group, these frequencies were 45.5% and 10.4%, respectively.

3. **Statistical Significance**: The p-value associated with the differences in TGFB1 gene polymorphism frequencies between the myopic and control groups was reported as p=0.36. This indicates that there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of TGFB1 gene polymorphisms between children with high myopia and those without (emmetropic children).

4. **Conclusion of the Study**: The study concluded that there were no significant differences in TGFB1 and LAMA1 gene polymorphisms between patients with high myopia and healthy subjects. This suggests that, at least within the context of this study population, TGFB1 gene polymorphisms do not correlate with high myopia.

**Conclusion**: Based on the lack of statistically significant differences in the frequencies of TGFB1 polymorphisms between myopic and non-myopic children, the abstract does not support the hypothesis that TGFB1 gene polymorphisms are associated with myopia. The results suggest that other genetic factors or environmental influences might be more relevant in the pathogenesis of high myopia, or that the role of TGFB1, if any, is not detectable in this sample size or population."	To investigate <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>LAMA1</i> gene polymorphisms in children with high myopia in order to determine the genetic basis of large myopic shifts causing severe visual impairment and complications. Seventy-four children with high myopia (≥6 diopters [D]; study group) and 77 emmetropic children (±0.5D; control group) were included. Genetic and polymorphism analyses were performed in the Medical Genetics Laboratory using DNA purified from the patients' blood samples. Mean ages of the patients were 7.1±3 (3-13) and 9.6±1.8 (6-13) years in the study and control groups, respectively. Mean refraction in the high myopia group were -10.1±4.3D in the right and -8.9±3.6D in the left eye. <i>LAMA1</i> gene analysis of the study group revealed heterozygous mutations in 34 patients (45.9%), homozygous mutations in 25 patients (33.8%), and no mutations in the remaining 15 patients (20.3%). In the control group, there were 31 subjects (40.3%) with heterozygous, 27 (35.1%) with homozygous <i>LAMA1</i> mutations, and no mutations in 19 (24.7%) (p=0.73). <i>TGFB1</i> gene analysis showed heterozygous mutations in 32 (43.2%) and homozygous mutations in 10 patients (13.5%) in the study group, while 32 patients (43.2%) had no mutations. In the control group, 35 subjects (45.5%) had heterozygous, 8 (10.4%) had homozygous, and 34 (44.1%) had no <i>TGFB1</i> mutations (p=0.36). This is the first study to simultaneously examine two genes in high myopia in a Turkish population. However, we observed no significant differences in <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>LAMA1</i> gene polymorphisms in patients with high myopia compared to healthy subjects.
52	23709348	EED gene polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer	EED	Colorectal cancer	0	"The biomedical abstract does not strongly support the statement that EED gene polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility overall. Instead, it provides a nuanced view where most EED polymorphisms were not significantly associated with CRC, except for specific contexts involving certain types of colorectal cancer or stages of the disease. Here’s a breakdown of the abstract’s findings and their implications:

1. **Study Objective and Methods**: The study aimed to determine the association between EED gene polymorphisms and CRC using high-resolution melting analysis to examine genotype and allele frequencies of EED SNPs in CRC patients compared to healthy controls.

2. **General Findings on EED Polymorphisms**: The results showed that the genotype and allele frequencies of the EED SNPs and the haplotype frequencies were generally not significantly different between CRC patients and healthy controls. This suggests that there is no broad association between EED polymorphisms and an increased risk of CRC in general.

3. **Specific Findings in Subgroups**: Despite the general findings, the study did identify a significant difference in the allele frequency of one specific SNP (g.-1850G>C) in the rectal cancer patient group compared to controls, indicating a possible association in this particular subgroup. Additionally, the g.-993G>C polymorphism was associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis in CRC, suggesting a role in the progression or severity of the disease rather than initial susceptibility.

4. **Statistical Power and Significance**: The study had a statistical power of 76.6%, which is relatively high, and it conducted its analyses at a 0.05 significance level. The findings that did show significant differences (like those in rectal cancer and lymph node metastasis) are thus statistically supported within the study’s design.

5. **Conclusions on EED Polymorphisms and CRC**: The abstract concludes that SNPs of the EED gene might not be associated with susceptibility to CRC overall, but indicates potential roles in specific aspects or subtypes of colorectal cancer, such as rectal cancer susceptibility and lymph node metastasis.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract does not support the general statement that EED gene polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer, as most of the SNPs studied showed no significant association with CRC. However, it does suggest potential links in specific circumstances, which could be important for understanding the complexities of cancer genetics and could influence future research or clinical approaches for particular CRC subtypes or stages."	Our previous work indicated that, first, the embryonic ectoderm development (EED) gene is a candidate gene associated with the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and, second, that the haplotypes of the EED polymorphism are one of the markers for UC susceptibility. The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) increases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.   The present study aimed at determining the association between polymorphisms in the EED gene and CRC.   Genotype analysis of EED single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed with high-resolution melting analysis, and the genotype and allele frequencies of the EED SNPs were compared between CRC patients and healthy controls. The haplotype frequencies of EED for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.   Our study had a power of 76.6% at a 0.05 significance level. Genotype and allele frequencies of the SNPs and haplotype frequencies of the EED gene in CRC patients were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. Only the allele frequency of g.-1850G>C in the rectal cancer (RC) patient group was significantly different from that of the control group (p=0.04). Similarly, the genotype and allelic frequencies of the EED SNPs for either tumor site (left or right) or tumor stage were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. However, our data show an association between the g.-993G>C polymorphism in the EED gene and the presence of lymph node metastasis in CRC.  These results suggest that the SNPs of the EED gene might not be associated with susceptibility to CRC. However, this study shows that the allele frequency of g.-1850G>C in the RC patient group was significantly different from that in the control group (p=0.04) and that g.-993G>C may play a role in the lymph node metastatic process of CRC.

1. **Study Objective and Methods**: The study aims to identify shared genetic factors between neurodegenerative disorders and IBD. This includes exploring genetic loci that might influence both conditions, using methods like Mendelian randomization and analysis of genetic loci and transcriptomic profiles.

2. **Findings on Genetic Loci**: The study identified two shared genetic loci associated with both ALS (a neurodegenerative disorder) and IBD. Through further investigation, several genes, including G2E3, were identified at these loci with functions related to membrane trafficking.

3. **Specific Role of G2E3**: G2E3 was highlighted as being differentially expressed and significantly correlated with another gene, SCFD1, in patients with either ALS or IBD. This differential expression and correlation suggest a role for G2E3 in the pathophysiology of these diseases, supporting the idea that changes in G2E3 expression or function might contribute to IBD.

4. **Contextual Interpretation**: While the abstract does not provide direct evidence of mutations in G2E3 causing IBD, the identification of G2E3 in the context of shared genetic architecture between ALS and IBD, along with its differential expression in IBD patients, supports the notion that G2E3 could be relevant to IBD pathogenesis.

5. **Implications for IBD Research and Treatment**: The findings suggest that further exploration of G2E3's role in IBD could yield insights into the disease's mechanisms and potentially lead to new therapeutic targets.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract supports a potential correlation between G2E3 and IBD through shared genetic factors with neurodegenerative diseases and specific gene expression patterns. However, more direct evidence would be needed to conclusively link G2E3 mutations to IBD. The study's findings encourage further research into how G2E3 might influence IBD pathogenesis."	Published observational studies have revealed the connection between neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whereas the causal association remains largely unclear. Our study aims to assess the causality and identify the shared genetic architecture between neurodegenerative disorders and IBD. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to assess the causality between IBD and neurodegenerative disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], and multiple sclerosis [MS]). Shared genetic loci, functional interpretation, and transcriptomic profiles were further investigated in ALS and IBD. We identified that genetic predisposition to IBD was suggestively associated with lower odds of ALS (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 0.99). In contrast, IBD was not genetically associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, or MS (and vice versa). Two shared genetic loci (rs6571361 and rs7154847) were derived, and SCFD1, G2E3, and HEATR5A were further identified as novel risk genes with enriched functions related to membrane trafficking. G2E3 was differentially expressed and significantly correlated with SCFD1 in patients with ALS or IBD. Our study reveals the suggestively protective role of IBD on ALS, and does not support the causality of AD, PD, or MS on IBD (and vice versa). Our findings indicate possible shared genetic architecture and pathways between ALS and IBD. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of IBD and neurodegenerative disorders.
54	28577926	Abnormal expression of MACF1 is associated with schizophrenia	MACF1	schizophrenia	1	"The biomedical abstract does support the statement that abnormal expression of MACF1 is associated with schizophrenia. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of MACF1**: MACF1 (Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1) is described as a versatile spectraplakin that plays critical roles in various cytoskeleton-related processes. It is implicated in maintaining the normal function of many tissues, highlighting its broad biological significance.

2. **Impact of MACF1 Dysfunction**: The abstract mentions that loss-of-function studies in knockout mouse models have shown the importance of MACF1 in several critical biological processes and developmental stages, including neural development. This establishes a foundational role for MACF1 in neural systems, which is relevant to neurological disorders such as schizophrenia.

3. **Association with Schizophrenia and Other Diseases**: Crucially, the abstract explicitly states that ""abnormal expression of MACF1 is associated with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, cancer, and osteoporosis."" This direct mention confirms the link between MACF1 expression levels and schizophrenia among other conditions, supporting the statement that changes in MACF1 expression are associated with the pathology of schizophrenia.

4. **Implications for Research and Therapy**: By reviewing research advances on MACF1’s roles in specific tissues and human diseases, the abstract suggests that understanding MACF1’s functions and dysfunctions could provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases and potential therapeutic targets, including for schizophrenia.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract directly supports the statement that abnormal expression of MACF1 is associated with schizophrenia by stating this as a finding in the context of discussing the broader roles of MACF1 in physiology and pathology. This link is important for future studies and potential interventions aimed at understanding or treating schizophrenia."	Spectraplakins are a family of evolutionarily conserved gigantic proteins and play critical roles in many cytoskeleton-related processes. Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) is one of the most versatile spectraplakin with multiple isoforms. As a broadly expressed mammalian spectraplakin, MACF1 is important in maintaining normal functions of many tissues. The loss-of-function studies using knockout mouse models reveal the pivotal roles of MACF1 in embryo development, skin integrity maintenance, neural development, bone formation, and colonic paracellular permeability. Mutation in the human MACF1 gene causes a novel myopathy genetic disease. In addition, abnormal expression of MACF1 is associated with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, cancer and osteoporosis. This demonstrates the crucial roles of MACF1 in physiology and pathology. Here, we review the research advances of MACF1's roles in specific tissue and in human diseases, providing the perspectives of MACF1 for future studies.
55	36505342	Mutations in MACF1 are a proven cause of breast cancer	MACF1	Breast cancer	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that mutations in MACF1 play a significant role in breast cancer progression and potentially affect patient outcomes, but it does not conclusively establish that MACF1 mutations are a proven cause of breast cancer. Here's a detailed analysis of the abstract:

1. **Objective and Scope of the Study**: The study aims to investigate the role of MACF1 mutations in breast cancer development. The objective is to understand the influence of these mutations on the disease, rather than to definitively prove causation.

2. **Methods and Data Analysis**: The study utilizes gene expression profile data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to compare patients with MACF1 mutations (MACF1-MT) against those without such mutations (MACF1-WT). The study employs survival analysis, differential gene expression analysis, and functional enrichment analyses to understand the impacts of MACF1 mutations.

3. **Results on Prognosis and Biological Impact**:
   - **Prognostic Impact**: Patients with MACF1 mutations had worse prognoses and higher tumor mutation burden scores, suggesting a potential link between these mutations and more aggressive disease.
   - **Biological Pathways**: MACF1 mutations were found to upregulate the mTOR signaling pathway and affect energy metabolism and the tumor immune microenvironment. This suggests that MACF1 mutations may influence cancer progression through multiple biological mechanisms.
   - **Response to Therapy**: The study also notes that MACF1 mutations might affect the response to immunotherapy, indicating that these mutations have functional consequences that could impact treatment outcomes.
   - **Drug Sensitivity**: Enhanced sensitivity to certain drugs in cells with MACF1 mutations suggests a possible therapeutic angle for targeting these mutations.

4. **Conclusion of the Study**: The abstract concludes that MACF1 mutations might serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer. However, it stops short of claiming that MACF1 mutations directly cause breast cancer. Instead, it positions the mutations as important factors in the disease's progression and response to treatment.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that MACF1 mutations are associated with significant effects on the progression, prognosis, and treatment response in breast cancer. However, it does not provide direct evidence that these mutations are a primary cause of breast cancer. The mutations are implicated in influencing disease characteristics and outcomes rather than being presented as definitive causative factors for the initial development of the cancer."	Microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1) mutations are known to play an important role in the progression of various cancers. However, its role in breast cancer remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated how MACF1 mutations may play a role in breast cancer development. The gene-expression profile data of patients with breast cancer were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Breast cancer cohort. We estimated the influence of MACF1 mutations on patient clinical prognosis using the Kaplan-Meier method. Further, patients with MACF1-mutant (MACF1-MT) and MACF1-wild-type (MACF1-WT) were compared to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also performed functional enrichment analyses, constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, and investigated the correlation between MACF1 mutations and immune-cell infiltration. To explore the prognostic value of MACF1 mutations, a nomogram was developed based on MACF1 mutations and other clinicopathological parameters. Patients with MACF1-MT had a worse prognosis and higher tumor mutation burden score (P < 0.05) than patients with MACF1-WT. MACF1 mutations were demonstrated to upregulate the mTOR signaling pathway and alter energy metabolism and tumor immune microenvironment. Thus, MACF1 mutations might affect immunogenicity and result in a lower response to immunotherapy. By analyzing the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to 13 drugs was found to be significantly enhanced by MACF1 mutations. The prognostic model was verified in predicting the outcome of breast cancer patients. MACF1 mutations might be a potential prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for breast cancer.
56	34112868	MADD is a therapeutic target for treatment of Alzheimer's disease	MADD	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that MADD is a therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Interaction and Role of MADD and TNFR1**: The abstract describes the interaction between TNFR1 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1) and MADD (MAPK Activating Death Domain), noting that they mediate downstream signaling pathways that contribute to neuronal cell death, a key pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease. This sets the stage by linking MADD directly to disease mechanisms.

2. **Molecular Docking Study**: The use of molecular docking to explore the interactions between TNFR1 and MADD helps to understand how these proteins contribute to the activation of pathways leading to neuronal cell death. The study identifies specific residues involved in these interactions, highlighting the potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

3. **Significance of Identified Residues**: The identification of Asp400, Arg58, and Arg59 as critical residues in the interaction between TNFR1 and MADD indicates specific sites where therapeutic agents might disrupt these interactions to prevent the activation of harmful signaling pathways.

4. **Molecular Dynamics Simulation**: The stability of the interactions between the death domains (DDs) of TNFR1 and MADD, confirmed through molecular dynamic simulations, suggests that these interactions are viable targets for drug development. Stability in this context implies that the interactions are consistent and significant enough to be effectively targeted by therapeutic agents.

5. **Therapeutic Implications**: The abstract concludes by suggesting that understanding and targeting the interactions between TNFR1 and MADD, particularly through their death domains, could be beneficial in treating Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the MAPK pathway, which is implicated in the disease's pathology.

6. **Novel Pharmacological Targets**: By highlighting the death domains of TNFR1 and MADD as potential novel pharmacological targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment, the abstract supports the idea that targeting MADD could inhibit key pathways involved in neuronal death, offering a new avenue for therapy development.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides strong evidence that MADD, through its interaction with TNFR1 and involvement in critical signaling pathways leading to neuronal cell death, could be a viable therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. The detailed molecular insights into the interactions and pathways provide a basis for the development of interventions aimed at modifying these interactions to treat Alzheimer's disease."	Proteins are tiny players involved in the activation and deactivation of multiple signaling cascades through interactions in cells. The TNFR1 and MADD interact with each other and mediate downstream protein signaling pathways which cause neuronal cell death and Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, a molecular docking approach was employed to explore the interactive behavior of TNFR1 and MADD proteins and their role in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The computational sequential and structural conformational results revealed that Asp400, Arg58, Arg59 were common residues of TNFR1 and MADD which are involved in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Aspartic acid in negatively charged residues is involved in the biosynthesis of protein. However, arginine is a positively charged residue with the potential to interact with oppositely charged amino acids. Furthermore, our molecular dynamic simulation results also ensured the stability of the backbone of TNFR1 and MADD death domains (DDs) in binding interactions. This DDs interaction mediates some conformational changes in TNFR1 which leads to the activation of mediators proteins in the cellular signaling pathways. Taken together, a better understanding of TNFR1 and MADD receptors and their activated signaling cascade may help treat Alzheimer's disease. The death domains of TNFR1 and MADD could be used as a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.
57	38247828	Expression of MDK correlates to hepatocellular carcinoma	MDK	hepatocellular carcinoma	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that expression of Midkine (MDK) correlates to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here’s how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Elevated MDK Levels in HCC**: The abstract highlights that, while Midkine (MDK) expression is barely detectable in normal adult tissues, its serum levels are found to be elevated in several types of cancer, including HCC. This elevation in a cancer-specific context, particularly in HCC, directly supports the correlation between MDK expression and hepatocellular carcinoma.

2. **Role in Diagnosis and Progression**: The abstract summarizes findings from recent studies that emphasize the role of MDK as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of HCC. The ability of MDK to differentiate between HCC patients and both healthy individuals and patients with other liver pathologies strengthens the argument for its correlation with HCC.

3. **Utility in Early-Stage Diagnosis**: MDK is noted to be especially valuable for diagnosing early-stage HCC, including in patients who are negative for α-fetoprotein (AFP), the most commonly used biomarker for HCC. This indicates that MDK might be detecting aspects of tumor biology that AFP misses, further emphasizing its relevance to HCC.

4. **Comparative Effectiveness with AFP**: The abstract also discusses the comparative effectiveness of MDK and AFP, noting that MDK, while less specific than AFP, offers superior sensitivity. This characteristic makes MDK a crucial biomarker for HCC, especially in detecting cases that might otherwise go unnoticed with AFP alone.

5. **Correlation with Disease Outcomes**: The mention of MDK’s correlation with high recurrence rates of HCC underscores its association not only with the presence of HCC but also with its progression and possibly with more aggressive forms of the disease.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract strongly supports the statement that expression of MDK correlates with hepatocellular carcinoma. It outlines MDK’s elevated presence in HCC compared to normal and other pathological states, its utility in early detection, and its role in understanding disease progression, all of which highlight its significant correlation with HCC. This makes MDK a valuable biomarker for diagnosis, monitoring, and potentially targeting in the treatment of HCC."	Midkine (MDK) is a multifunctional secreted protein that can act as a cytokine or growth factor regulating multiple signaling pathways and being implicated in fundamental cellular processes, such as survival, proliferation, and migration. Although its expression in normal adult tissues is barely detectable, MDK serum levels are found to be elevated in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this review, we summarize the findings of recent studies on the role of MDK in HCC diagnosis and progression. Overall, studies show that MDK is a powerful biomarker for HCC early diagnosis, as it can differentiate not only between HCC patients and normal individuals but also between HCC patients and patients with other liver pathologies. It is correlated with high recurrence rates and was shown to be valuable for the diagnosis of early-stage HCC, even in patients negative for α-fetoprotein (AFP), the most commonly used biomarker for HCC diagnosis. A comparison with AFP reveals that MDK is inferior to AFP with regard to specificity but significantly superior with regard to sensitivity, which further indicates the need for using both biomarkers for more effective HCC diagnosis.
58	30457776	Nitisinone effectively targets MDK	Nitisinone 	MDK	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that Nitisinone effectively targets Midkine (MDK). Here’s why:

1. **Purpose of Nitisinone**: Nitisinone is described as an inhibitor of the tyrosine catabolic pathway, specifically used for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1). The abstract focuses on the pharmacological action of Nitisinone related to its role in blocking the degradation of tyrosine, which is crucial for managing HT-1, a rare metabolic disorder.

2. **Lack of Mention of MDK**: The abstract does not mention Midkine (MDK) at all. Nitisinone’s mechanism of action and its clinical application as outlined in the abstract are unrelated to the functions or expressions of MDK, which is involved in cellular processes like growth, survival, and migration.

3. **Content of the Abstract**: The details provided are centered on the dosing, cost, and economic analysis of Nitisinone for HT-1, and there’s no discussion about its effects on MDK or its related signaling pathways. 

4. **Conclusion and Relevance**: Given that the abstract thoroughly describes Nitisinone's use in a specific metabolic pathway and disease, without any connection to MDK or its associated pathways, it does not provide any support for the statement that Nitisinone targets MDK. The focus is entirely on a different aspect of its pharmacology.

**Conclusion**: The statement that Nitisinone effectively targets MDK is not supported by this abstract. The drug’s clinical use and mechanism of action are clearly described as being specific to the treatment of HT-1 and the inhibition of the tyrosine catabolic pathway, with no relevance to MDK or its modulation."	
59	35880649	Mutations in MFRP are associated with nanophthalmos 	MFRP	nanophthalmos 	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that mutations in MFRP are associated with nanophthalmos. Here's how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Role of MFRP**: The abstract begins by acknowledging the critical role of the Membrane Frizzled-Related Protein (MFRP) in ocular development. It notes that mutations in MFRP are known to cause nanophthalmos and other ocular conditions, establishing the gene’s significance in eye-related disorders.

2. **Genetic Findings in Affected Individuals**: The abstract details the genetic analysis of two affected siblings who were found to have MFRP mutations—specifically variants c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro). These mutations were found ""in trans,"" meaning each sibling inherited a different mutation from each parent. This genetic configuration is crucial for expressing the disease phenotype in autosomal recessive conditions like those typically associated with MFRP mutations.

3. **Clinical Manifestations**: The presence of these mutations correlated with specific clinical findings in the affected siblings, including markedly reduced photopic and scotopic responses on electroretinograms (ERGs) and abnormalities observed in optical coherence tomography. These findings are consistent with the visual impairment symptoms associated with nanophthalmos.

4. **Phenotypic Spectrum**: The abstract discusses the broad clinical spectrum of MFRP mutations, indicating variability in how the mutations manifest, which is typical in genetic disorders depending on other genetic and environmental factors.

5. **Study Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that MFRP-related ocular disease, including nanophthalmos, may be underrecognized due to its variable presentation. The specific mutations identified in the study are directly linked to the nanophthalmos phenotype observed in the patients, affirming the association between MFRP mutations and the disease.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides clear evidence supporting the association between mutations in MFRP and nanophthalmos, based on both genetic findings and clinical manifestations in patients. The detailed description of the mutations and their effects on ocular physiology underlines the critical role of MFRP in the pathogenesis of nanophthalmos, making it a significant focus for diagnosis and potential therapeutic interventions."	Membrane frizzled-related protein (MFRP) plays a critical role in ocular development. <i>MFRP</i> mutations are known to cause nanophthalmos and, in some cases, retinitis pigmentosa, foveoschisis, and/or optic nerve head (ONH) drusen. The broad clinical spectrum of <i>MFRP</i> mutations necessitates further investigation of specific genotype-phenotype relationships. We reviewed ophthalmologic and genetic medical records of two affected siblings and one unaffected sibling. Genetic testing revealed variants <i>MFRP</i> c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and <i>MFRP</i> c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro) in <i>trans</i> in the two affected siblings. In both cases, photopic and scotopic responses were markedly reduced on electroretinogram (ERG), with greater decrease in scotopic function. Optical coherence tomography for both siblings revealed non-cystoid thickening. Blunted foveal reflexes were also observed in both siblings. Notably, foveal avascular zone abnormalities were seen on fundus autofluorescence in only one affected sibling. MFRP-related ocular disease may be underrecognized due to its presentation with high hyperopia and possibly subtle retinal findings. Presence of variants <i>MFRP</i> c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and <i>MFRP</i> c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro) in <i>trans</i> resulted in nanophthalmos and retinitis pigmentosa without associated foveoschisis or ONH drusen in our patients, consistent with the incomplete phenotype previously described in Neri et al. Abnormalities in the foveal avascular zone have been noted in other case studies and were inconsistently associated with the variants described here, representing a potential area for future investigation.
60	24639090	Mutations in MGA lead to heart disease	MGA	heart disease	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in the MGA gene lead to heart disease. Instead, the focus of the abstract is on developing and validating a sensor based on the MGA gene of *Streptococcus pyogenes* for diagnosing rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Here's a breakdown of the abstract and its relevance to the statement:

1. **Gene and Application**: The MGA gene mentioned in the abstract refers to a gene in *Streptococcus pyogenes*, not a human gene associated directly with genetic heart conditions. The sensor developed using this gene is designed to detect the presence of *S. pyogenes* DNA in throat swabs from patients suspected of having rheumatic heart disease, which is a condition that can develop following infections with this bacterium.

2. **Technological Focus**: The abstract details the technical aspects of creating a genosensor, including the immobilization of a DNA probe on an electrode, hybridization with genomic DNA from the bacteria, and measurements using electrochemical techniques. The sensitivity and stability of the sensor are emphasized, highlighting its potential utility in clinical diagnostics.

3. **Clinical Application**: The purpose of the sensor is to facilitate early diagnosis of RHD by detecting *S. pyogenes*, thereby potentially preventing the progression of the disease which can affect the heart. However, this is about diagnosing an infection that can lead to a sequela (RHD), not about a genetic mutation in humans directly causing heart disease.

4. **Relevance to Heart Disease Statement**: The abstract does not discuss any human genetic mutations or their direct implications for heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease is an autoimmune condition that can develop after a bacterial infection and involves the heart, but it is not caused by a genetic mutation in the MGA gene.

5. **Conclusion**: While the sensor might be significant for early detection of conditions that can lead to RHD, there is no support in the abstract for the notion that mutations in the MGA gene are linked to heart disease in the genetic sense typically discussed in medical genetics. The MGA gene referred to here is related to a bacterial pathogen, not a human gene.

Therefore, the statement that mutations in MGA lead to heart disease is not supported by this abstract, as it misaligns the genetic context and the specific disease mechanism discussed."	The 5' amino-labeled DNA probe complementary to mga gene of Streptococcus pyogenes was immobilized on carboxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes electrode and hybridized with 0.1-100 ng/6 μl single-stranded genomic DNA (ssG-DNA) of S. pyogenes from throat swab of suspected rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients. Electrochemical response was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance (EI). The sensitivity of the sensor was 106.03 (μA/cm(2))/ng and limit of detection (LOD) was found 0.014 ng/6 μl with regression coefficient (R(2)) of 0.921 using DPV. The genosensor was characterized by FTIR and SEM, and electrode was found stable for 6 months on storage at 4 °C with 5-6 % loss in initial DPV current. mga genosensor is the first report on RHD sensor which can save life of several suspected patients by early diagnosis in 30 min.
61	31468281	Mutations in NAGA lead to Schindler disease	NAGA	Schindler disease	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that mutations in the NAGA gene lead to Schindler disease. Here is how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Identification of Disease and Genetic Cause**: The abstract states that Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by defects in the NAGA gene, which encodes the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGA). This establishes a direct link between mutations in the NAGA gene and the disease.

2. **Specific Genetic Mutation**: The abstract details a specific homozygous missense variant (c.838C>A; p.L280I) in the NAGA gene identified in a patient with severe neurological manifestations of Schindler disease. This mutation is presented as causal due to its effects on enzyme function and clinical presentation.

3. **Biochemical Evidence**: It is reported that α-NAGA activity was significantly reduced in the proband and his sister, both carrying the same mutation, supporting the dysfunction caused by this specific genetic change. The enzyme activity levels were much lower than normal, correlating with the disease phenotype.

4. **Functional Impact of the Mutation**: Further functional analysis, including protein molecular dynamic simulation, showed that the L280I substitution affects the enzyme's dynamics and its ability to bind to the active site, providing a mechanistic understanding of how the mutation causes disease by hindering enzyme function.

5. **Clinical Heterogeneity**: Despite similar genetic profiles, there is noted variability in the disease expression among family members, indicating that other genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors may influence the severity of the disease. This points to the complex nature of genetic disorders and the impact of single mutations.

6. **Diagnosis Confirmation**: The diagnosis of Schindler disease in the proband was confirmed through clinical, biochemical, and genetic analyses, linking the observed symptoms and biochemical abnormalities directly to the mutation in the NAGA gene.

7. **Implications for Genetic Counseling and Management**: The abstract concludes with the necessity for further studies due to the clinical heterogeneity observed, emphasizing the importance of understanding such mutations for genetic counseling and disease management.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides a comprehensive account of how mutations in the NAGA gene are associated with Schindler disease, supporting the initial statement with detailed genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence. It highlights the critical role of the NAGA gene in the disease's pathology and the importance of genetic analysis in diagnosing and managing rare genetic disorders."	Schindler disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGA) activity due to defects in the NAGA gene. Accumulation of the enzyme's substrates results in clinically heterogeneous symptoms ranging from asymptomatic individuals to individuals with severe neurological manifestations. Here, a 5-year-old Emirati male born to consanguineous parents presented with congenital microcephaly and severe neurological manifestations. Whole genome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense variant (c.838C>A; p.L280I) in the NAGA gene. The allele is a reported SNP in the ExAC database with a 0.0007497 allele frequency. The proband's asymptomatic sister and cousin carry the same genotype in a homozygous state as revealed from the family screening. Due to the extreme intrafamilial heterogeneity of the disease as seen in previously reported cases, we performed further analyses to establish the pathogenicity of this variant. Both the proband and his sister showed abnormal urine oligosaccharide patterns, which is consistent with the diagnosis of Schindler disease. The α-NAGA activity was significantly reduced in the proband and his sister with 5.9% and 12.1% of the mean normal activity, respectively. Despite the activity loss, p.L280I α-NAGA processing and trafficking were not affected. However, protein molecular dynamic simulation analysis revealed that this amino acid substitution is likely to affect the enzyme's natural dynamics and hinders its ability to bind to the active site. Functional analysis confirmed the pathogenicity of the identified missense variant and the diagnosis of Schindler disease. Extreme intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity of the disease necessitates further studies for proper genetic counseling and management.
62	34867278	Lysosomal dysfunction correlates to Parkinson's disease	Lysosomal dysfunction	Parkinson's Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that lysosomal dysfunction correlates to Parkinson's disease (PD). Here is a detailed breakdown of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Study Focus and Background**: The abstract begins by acknowledging the growing body of evidence that points to lysosomal dysfunction as a key factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease at genetic, biochemical, and cellular levels. This sets the context for understanding the importance of lysosomal function in PD.

2. **Genetic Analysis of LSD Genes in PD**: The study investigates the association between rare variants in lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) genes and Parkinson's disease in a large cohort of Chinese mainland patients. This approach is based on the premise that mutations in genes involved in lysosomal function might contribute to the development or progression of PD.

3. **Significant Findings**: The results show a significant burden of rare variants in LSD genes in patients with PD, particularly in those with familial or sporadic early-onset forms of the disease. This finding underscores the genetic link between lysosomal dysfunction and PD.

4. **Subgroup Analysis**: The burden analysis within subgroups of LSD genes reveals significant associations between specific types of lysosomal dysfunction (e.g., sphingolipidosis deficiency disorders) and early-onset PD. This suggests that different types of lysosomal dysfunction might contribute to different forms or trajectories of the disease.

5. **Novel Risk Genes Identified**: The study identifies several novel genes associated with PD that are involved in lysosomal functions, including SMPD1, GUSB, CLN6, PPT1, and SCARB2. This not only reinforces the role of lysosomal dysfunction in PD but also expands the known genetic landscape associated with the disease.

6. **Implications for Pathogenesis and Treatment**: By confirming the importance of lysosomal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PD and highlighting genetic heterogeneity between early and late-onset forms, the study provides insights that could influence future therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting lysosomal functions.

7. **Conclusion**: The conclusion of the study solidifies the link between lysosomal dysfunction and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that LSD genes play a significant role in the disease and pointing towards lysosomal pathways as potential targets for treatment.

**Overall Impact**: The abstract provides compelling evidence that lysosomal dysfunction is closely correlated with Parkinson's disease, particularly through the association of rare genetic variants in LSD genes with the disease. This supports the statement and adds a detailed genetic perspective to the understanding of how lysosomal dysfunction can influence Parkinson's disease pathogenesis."	<b>Background:</b> Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of studies indicating an essential role of the lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) at the genetic, biochemical, and cellular pathway levels. In this study, we investigated the association between rare variants in lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) genes and Chinese mainland PD. <b>Methods:</b> We explored the association between rare variants of 69 LSD genes and PD in 3,879 patients and 2,931 controls from Parkinson's Disease & Movement Disorders Multicenter Database and Collaborative Network in China (PD-MDCNC) using next-generation sequencing, which were analyzed by using the optimized sequence kernel association test. <b>Results:</b> We identified the significant burden of rare putative LSD gene variants in Chinese mainland patients with PD. This association was robust in familial or sporadic early-onset patients after excluding the <i>GBA</i> variants but not in sporadic late-onset patients. The burden analysis of variant sets in genes of LSD subgroups revealed a suggestive significant association between variant sets in genes of sphingolipidosis deficiency disorders and familial or sporadic early-onset patients. In contrast, variant sets in genes of sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, and post-translational modification defect disorders were suggestively associated with sporadic late-onset patients. Then, <i>SMPD1</i> and other four novel genes (i.e., <i>GUSB, CLN6, PPT1</i>, and <i>SCARB2</i>) were suggestively associated with sporadic early-onset or familial patients, whereas <i>GALNS</i> and <i>NAGA</i> were suggestively associated with late-onset patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings supported the association between LSD genes and PD and revealed several novel risk genes in Chinese mainland patients with PD, which confirmed the importance of lysosomal mechanisms in PD pathogenesis. Moreover, we identified the genetic heterogeneity in early-onset and late-onset of patients with PD, which may provide valuable suggestions for the treatment.
63	33931730	Mutations in NAGA affect susceptibility to schizophrenia	NAGA	schizophrenia	1	"The biomedical abstract supports the statement that mutations in NAGA affect susceptibility to schizophrenia, particularly through the regulatory effects of genetic variants on NAGA expression. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Genetic Variant and Association with Schizophrenia**: The abstract discusses the identification of a missense variant, rs1801311, in the NDUFA6 gene located at the 22q13.2 locus, which has been robustly associated with schizophrenia. This variant disrupts the binding of transcription factors and is likely causal for schizophrenia.

2. **Interaction with NAGA**: Intriguingly, rs1801311 is found to physically interact with NAGA, which encodes the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of glycoproteins and glycolipids in the lysosome, processes that are critical for normal cellular function.

3. **Regulation of NAGA Expression**: The risk allele (G) of rs1801311 is associated with higher expression of NAGA in the human brain. This suggests that the presence of the risk allele leads to increased levels of NAGA, which the study connects to the pathology of schizophrenia.

4. **eQTL and Expression Analysis**: Consistent with the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, NAGA was found to be significantly upregulated in the brains of schizophrenia cases compared to controls. This supports the hypothesis that higher expression of NAGA, influenced by rs1801311, is associated with the disease.

5. **Functional Implications of NAGA**: Further, the study discusses how NAGA regulates important neurodevelopmental processes such as the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. This aligns with many theories of schizophrenia’s etiology, which often involve dysregulation of neurodevelopmental pathways.

6. **Pathways Analysis**: Transcriptome analysis provided additional evidence that NAGA regulates pathways associated with neuronal differentiation, further linking its role to key processes that could influence schizophrenia development.

7. **Validation of the Association**: The association between rs1801311 and schizophrenia was independently confirmed in a large Chinese cohort, reinforcing the robustness of the findings.

**Conclusion**: The abstract supports the statement that mutations in NAGA affect susceptibility to schizophrenia by demonstrating how a specific genetic variant associated with the disease leads to altered expression of NAGA, which in turn appears to play a significant role in brain function and development relevant to schizophrenia. This study highlights the complex interplay between genetic variants and their regulatory effects on gene expression as mechanisms underlying schizophrenia susceptibility."	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed that genetic variants at the 22q13.2 risk locus were robustly associated with schizophrenia. However, the causal variants at this risk locus and their roles in schizophrenia remain elusive. Here we identify the risk missense variant rs1801311 (located in the 1st exon of NDUFA6 gene) as likely causal for schizophrenia at 22q13.2 by disrupting binding of YY1, TAF1, and POLR2A. We systematically elucidated the regulatory mechanisms of rs1801311 and validated the regulatory effect of this missense variant. Intriguingly, rs1801311 physically interacted with NAGA (encodes the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which is mainly involved in regulating metabolisms of glycoproteins and glycolipids in lysosome) and showed the most significant association with NAGA expression in the human brain, with the risk allele (G) associated with higher NAGA expression. Consistent with eQTL analysis, expression analysis showed that NAGA was significantly upregulated in brains of schizophrenia cases compared with controls, further supporting that rs1801311 may confer schizophrenia risk by regulating NAGA expression. Of note, we found that NAGA regulates important neurodevelopmental processes, including proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Transcriptome analysis corroborated that NAGA regulates pathways associated with neuronal differentiation. Finally, we independently confirmed the association between rs1801311 and schizophrenia in a large Chinese cohort. Our study elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the missense schizophrenia risk variant rs1801311 and provides mechanistic links between risk variant and schizophrenia etiology. In addition, this study also revealed the novel role of coding variants in gene regulation and schizophrenia risk, i.e., genetic variant in coding region of a specific gene may confer disease risk through regulating distal genes (act as regulatory variant for distal genes).
64	26789410	Variations in ORAI1 are associated with Kawasaki disease	ORAI1 	Kawasaki disease	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that variations in ORAI1 are associated with Kawasaki disease (KD). Here’s how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Context and Relevance of ORAI1**: ORAI1 is identified as a critical component of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, which mediates store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) critical for cellular functions. The abstract links the Ca(2+)/NFAT signaling pathway, which involves ORAI1, to the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease, a systemic vasculitis syndrome.

2. **Genetic Linkage and Association Study**: The gene for ORAI1 is situated on chromosome 12q24, a region previously linked to Kawasaki disease in affected sibling-pair studies. This positional association suggests a genetic link between the location of ORAI1 and Kawasaki disease.

3. **Statistical Association with Kawasaki Disease**: The abstract details significant associations between a non-synonymous SNP (rs3741596) within ORAI1 and Kawasaki disease across multiple sample sets and analyses:
   - **Discovery sample set**: P = 0.028 (729 KD cases vs. 1,315 controls)
   - **Replication sample set**: P = 0.0056 (1,813 KD cases vs. 1,097 controls)
   - **Meta-analysis**: P = 0.00041

   These findings strongly indicate that the genetic variation within ORAI1 is associated with an increased risk of developing Kawasaki disease.

4. **Population-Specific Allele Frequency**: The risk allele of rs3741596 is notably more prevalent in Japanese populations than in Europeans, suggesting a potential population-specific genetic susceptibility to Kawasaki disease that involves ORAI1.

5. **Additional Variant Association**: The abstract also mentions a rare in-frame insertion variant (rs141919534) that is associated with Kawasaki disease (P = 0.012), further supporting the involvement of ORAI1 gene variations in the disease.

6. **Implications for Pathogenesis**: The identification of these variants in ORAI1 and their association with Kawasaki disease underscores the potential importance of the Ca(2+)/NFAT signaling pathway, mediated by ORAI1, in the pathogenesis of this condition. This suggests a mechanism by which ORAI1 variations might influence disease development, potentially through dysregulation of calcium signaling.

**Conclusion**: Overall, the abstract provides substantial evidence that variations in the ORAI1 gene are associated with Kawasaki disease, thus supporting the statement. The detailed genetic findings and the statistical significance of the associations underscore the role of ORAI1 as a contributing factor in the disease’s etiology and highlight the gene as a potential target for further research and therapeutic intervention."	Kawasaki disease (KD; MIM#61175) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome with unknown etiology which predominantly affects infants and children. Recent findings of susceptibility genes for KD suggest possible involvement of the Ca(2+)/NFAT pathway in the pathogenesis of KD. ORAI1 is a Ca(2+) release activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel mediating store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) on the plasma membrane. The gene for ORAI1 is located in chromosome 12q24 where a positive linkage signal was observed in our previous affected sib-pair study of KD. A common non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism located within exon 2 of ORAI1 (rs3741596) was significantly associated with KD (P = 0.028 in the discovery sample set (729 KD cases and 1,315 controls), P = 0.0056 in the replication sample set (1,813 KD cases vs. 1,097 controls) and P = 0.00041 in a meta-analysis by the Mantel-Haenszel method). Interestingly, frequency of the risk allele of rs3741596 is more than 20 times higher in Japanese compared to Europeans. We also found a rare 6 base-pair in-frame insertion variant associated with KD (rs141919534; 2,544 KD cases vs. 2,414 controls, P = 0.012). These data indicate that ORAI1 gene variations are associated with KD and may suggest the potential importance of the Ca(2+)/NFAT pathway in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
65	37488473	Mutations in ANXA9 cause Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	ANXA9	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	0	"The biomedical abstract does not provide direct support for the statement that mutations in ANXA9 cause Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here's why:

1. **Study Focus and Methodology**: The study uses weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene modules correlated with the severity of NAFLD. While this method can highlight genes associated with disease severity, it does not establish causality. It primarily points to correlations between gene expression patterns and disease stages.

2. **Identification of Driving Genes**: The study identifies ANXA9 as one of several ""driving genes"" in modules correlated with NAFLD severity. Being listed as a driving gene implies that ANXA9's expression is associated with the condition. However, the term ""driving gene"" here is used to denote a gene whose expression patterns are significantly associated with the disease traits studied, rather than implying a direct causal role in disease pathogenesis.

3. **Lack of Specific Evidence for ANXA9's Role**: Although ANXA9 is mentioned as one of the genes of interest, the abstract does not provide specific evidence or detailed analysis on how ANXA9 contributes to NAFLD. The study does not mention any functional studies, mutation analyses, or mechanistic insights specifically linking ANXA9 to NAFLD development or progression.

4. **Focus on C/EBPα**: The abstract emphasizes findings related to C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α), including its upregulation in NAFLD and its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. The prominence of C/EBPα in the results suggests that this gene was a more significant focus of the study compared to ANXA9, whose specific role in NAFLD is not detailed.

5. **General Conclusion**: The conclusion of the study highlights the identification of gene modules and driving genes associated with NAFLD progression and suggests these genes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This broad statement suggests a general association but does not confirm a causative role for any specific gene, including ANXA9.

**Conclusion**: While the abstract suggests that ANXA9 is associated with NAFLD through its identification in relevant gene modules, it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the statement that mutations in ANXA9 cause NAFLD. More detailed genetic and functional analyses would be required to establish a causative link between specific mutations in ANXA9 and the development of NAFLD."	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive liver fat deposition, and progresses to liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the invasive diagnosis of NAFLD with histopathological evaluation remains risky. This study investigated potential genes correlated with NAFLD, which may serve as diagnostic biomarkers and even potential treatment targets. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed based on dataset E-MEXP-3291. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to evaluate the function of genes. Blue module was positively correlated, and turquoise module negatively correlated with the severity of NAFLD. Furthermore, 8 driving genes (ANXA9, FBXO2, ORAI3, NAGS, C/EBPα, CRYAA, GOLM1, TRIM14) were identified from the overlap of genes in blue module and GSE89632. And another 8 driving genes were identified from the overlap of turquoise module and GSE89632. Among these driving genes, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α) was the most notable. By validating the expression of C/EBPα in the liver of NAFLD mice using immunohistochemistry, we discovered a significant upregulation of C/EBPα protein in NAFLD. we identified two modules and 16 driving genes associated with the progression of NAFLD, and confirmed the protein expression of C/EBPα, which had been paid little attention to in the context of NAFLD, in the present study. Our study will advance the understanding of NAFLD. Moreover, these driving genes may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of NAFLD.
66	17415708	Mutations in NAMA contribute to papillary thyroid carcinoma	NAMA	papillary thyroid carcinoma	0	"The biomedical abstract does not explicitly support the statement that mutations in NAMA contribute to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Instead, the abstract provides evidence for the association between the downregulation of a novel gene named NAMA and the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in PTC. Here's a detailed breakdown of the abstract's content and its relevance to the statement:

1. **Context and Focus of the Study**: The study aims to identify tumor suppressor genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma by comparing gene expression in tumor tissues to unaffected tissues. The search led to the discovery of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a specific genomic region and underexpression of several ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) around a genetic marker associated with PTC.

2. **Identification of NAMA**: Among the underexpressed ESTs, one specific EST, which is part of the newly identified gene NAMA, was notably downregulated in association with the BRAF V600E mutation, a common genetic alteration in PTC. NAMA is characterized as a noncoding RNA associated with the MAP kinase pathway and growth arrest.

3. **Characterization of NAMA**: The study describes NAMA as weakly expressed in various tissues, with spliced forms primarily detected in the testis. It is indicated to be a noncoding but functional RNA, with no significant open reading frames, suggesting it does not encode a protein but may have regulatory functions.

4. **Regulatory and Functional Implications**: NAMA expression is inducible by various factors including knockdown of BRAF, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, growth arrest, and DNA damage in cancer cell lines. This suggests a role in cellular responses to genetic and environmental stressors, potentially acting through regulatory mechanisms rather than direct mutational effects.

5. **Suggestion of Tumor Suppressor Role**: While the abstract suggests that NAMA could be associated with growth arrest and might be a noncoding RNA involved in the regulatory processes related to tumor suppression, it does not provide evidence of mutations in NAMA directly contributing to the development of PTC. The connection made is more about expression levels in relation to other known genetic changes (BRAF V600E mutation) rather than mutations in the NAMA gene itself.

**Conclusion**: The abstract provides valuable insights into the potential role of NAMA in PTC through its expression patterns and associations with known oncogenic pathways (like BRAF and MAP kinase). However, it does not support the statement that mutations in NAMA contribute to PTC, as it does not discuss any specific mutations in the NAMA gene itself affecting the disease's pathogenesis. The study instead points to NAMA's possible involvement as a noncoding RNA that may influence cancer development through mechanisms of gene expression regulation and response to cellular stress."	In search of tumor suppressor genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), we previously used gene expression profiling to identify genes underexpressed in tumor compared with paired unaffected tissue. While searching for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in genomic regions harboring candidate tumor suppressor genes, we detected LOH in a approximately 20 kb region around marker D9S176. Several ESTs flanking D9S176 were underexpressed in PTC tumors, and for one of the ESTs, downregulation was highly associated with the activating BRAF mutation V600E, the most common genetic lesion in PTC. A novel gene, NAMA, (noncoding RNA associated with MAP kinase pathway and growth arrest) containing the affected EST was cloned and characterized. NAMA is weakly expressed in several human tissues, and the spliced forms are primarily detected in testis. Several characteristics of NAMA suggest that it is a nonprotein coding but functional RNA; it has no long open reading frames (ORFs); the exons exhibit low sequence identity in the evolutionarily conserved regions; it is inducible by knockdown of BRAF, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, growth arrest and DNA damage in cancer cell lines. We suggest that NAMA is a noncoding RNA associated with growth arrest.
67	35982159	Mutations in NAV3 are associated with autism	NAV3	Autism	1	"The biomedical abstract does indeed support the statement that mutations in NAV3 are associated with autism. Here's how the abstract provides evidence for this claim:

1. **Large-Scale Genetic Analysis**: The study undertook a two-stage analysis involving a large cohort of 42,607 autism cases, which included 35,130 new cases. Such a significant sample size provides a robust basis for detecting genetic associations with autism.

2. **Identification of Risk Genes**: Among the findings, the study identified 60 genes that reached exome-wide significance for association with autism. This includes NAV3, along with four other newly identified risk genes (ITSN1, MARK2, SCAF1, and HNRNPUL2).

3. **Specific Association with NAV3**: The association of NAV3 with autism risk is specifically noted to be primarily driven by rare inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The study quantifies this association with an estimated relative risk of 4, which is indicative of a moderate effect size.

4. **Comparative Cognitive Impact**: The abstract also provides context on the cognitive impact of mutations in moderate-risk genes compared to highly penetrant genes. It notes that autistic individuals with LoF variants in the four moderate-risk genes, including NAV3, generally have less cognitive impairment compared to those with LoF variants in more highly penetrant genes.

5. **Statistical Significance**: The provided statistics, such as the P-value (P = 1.9 × 10-6) for cognitive impairment differences, underscore the robustness of the findings, confirming the significant association of these mutations with specific clinical features of autism.

6. **Conclusion on Genetic Associations**: The study concludes that larger numbers of autism cases will be necessary to identify additional moderate-risk genes, suggesting ongoing research is needed to fully understand the genetic landscape. However, the identification of NAV3 among the significant findings emphasizes its relevance in the genetic etiology of autism.

**Summary**: Based on this abstract, there is clear support for the association between NAV3 mutations and autism. The evidence is drawn from a large-scale genetic study, showing that rare inherited LoF variants in NAV3 contribute significantly to autism risk, albeit with a moderate effect compared to more highly penetrant genes. This establishes NAV3 as a significant genetic factor in the context of autism spectrum disorders."	To capture the full spectrum of genetic risk for autism, we performed a two-stage analysis of rare de novo and inherited coding variants in 42,607 autism cases, including 35,130 new cases recruited online by SPARK. We identified 60 genes with exome-wide significance (P < 2.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), including five new risk genes (NAV3, ITSN1, MARK2, SCAF1 and HNRNPUL2). The association of NAV3 with autism risk is primarily driven by rare inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants, with an estimated relative risk of 4, consistent with moderate effect. Autistic individuals with LoF variants in the four moderate-risk genes (NAV3, ITSN1, SCAF1 and HNRNPUL2; n = 95) have less cognitive impairment than 129 autistic individuals with LoF variants in highly penetrant genes (CHD8, SCN2A, ADNP, FOXP1 and SHANK3) (59% vs 88%, P = 1.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Power calculations suggest that much larger numbers of autism cases are needed to identify additional moderate-risk genes.
68	22173670	Mutations in NAV3 have no correlation with colorectal cancer	NAV3	Colorectal cancer	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in NAV3 have no correlation with colorectal cancer (CRC); rather, it provides evidence that changes in NAV3, particularly deletions and alterations in copy number, are indeed correlated with CRC. Here’s a detailed analysis of how the abstract provides this support:

1. **Study Objective and Methods**: The study specifically investigated the role of navigator 3 (NAV3) in colorectal cancer. It used several genetic analysis techniques (fluorescence in situ hybridization, loss of heterozygosity, and array-CGH) to examine changes in chromosome 12 and NAV3 copy number in samples from CRC patients and CRC cell lines.

2. **Findings on NAV3 Changes**: The results showed that NAV3 deletion and chromosome 12 polysomy were detected in significant percentages of microsatellite stability (MSS) carcinomas, adenomas, and CRC cell lines. Additionally, NAV3 amplification was found in 25% of MSS samples. These findings indicate that genetic alterations in NAV3 are relatively common in CRC.

3. **Correlation with Disease Progression**: Importantly, the alterations in NAV3 were correlated with lymph node metastasis, which is a key indicator of cancer progression. This correlation suggests that NAV3 plays a role in the disease severity and metastatic potential of colorectal cancer.

4. **Functional Impact of NAV3 Silencing**: The study also explored the effects of NAV3 silencing on gene expression, finding that it induced the upregulation of interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Increased IL23R expression was strongly correlated with more advanced disease stages (Dukes' staging) and lymph node metastases in MSS and microsatellite instability tumors.

5. **Conclusion and Implications**: The conclusion drawn by the researchers is that NAV3 copy number changes are frequent and significant in both CRC and adenomas. The study also posits that NAV3 may link tissue inflammation to cancer development in the colon, indicating a potential mechanistic role in CRC pathogenesis.

**Summary**: Contrary to the statement that mutations in NAV3 have no correlation with colorectal cancer, this abstract provides strong evidence that alterations in NAV3 are indeed relevant to CRC. These alterations are linked not only to the presence of the disease but also to its progression and severity, underscoring the importance of NAV3 in the genetic landscape of colorectal cancer. Thus, NAV3 appears to be a significant factor in CRC development and metastasis."	The recently described navigator proteins have a multifaceted role in cytoskeletal dynamics. We report here on the relevance of one of them, navigator 3 (NAV3), in colorectal cancer (CRC). We analysed changes in chromosome 12 and NAV3 copy number in CRC/adenoma samples of 59 patients and in 6 CRC cell lines, using fluorescence in situ hybridisation, loss of heterozygosity, and array-CGH. NAV3 target genes were identified by siRNA depletion, expression arrays, and immunohistochemistry. NAV3 deletion and chromosome 12 polysomy were detected in 30 and 70% of microsatellite stability (MSS) carcinomas, in 23 and 30% of adenomas and in four of six CRC cell lines. NAV3 amplification was found in 25% of MSS samples. NAV3 alterations correlated with lymph node metastasis. In normal colon cells, NAV3 silencing induced upregulation of interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) and gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor. In MSS and microsatellite instability tumours, IL23R immunoreactivity correlated with Dukes' staging and lymph node metastases, whereas nuclear beta-catenin correlated with lymph node metastases only. NAV3 copy number changes are frequent in CRC and in adenomas, and upregulation of IL23R, following NAV3 silencing, strongly correlates with Dukes' staging and lymph node metastases. This suggests that NAV3 has a role in linking tissue inflammation to cancer development in the colon.
69	31809667	Variations in NAT1 affect asthma risk	NAT1	Asthma	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that variations in NAT1 affect asthma risk, especially in children exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS). Here’s a detailed explanation of how the abstract supports this statement:

1. **Objective and Study Focus**: The study's primary objective is to assess whether polymorphisms in the NAT1 gene increase the risk of developing asthma in children exposed to SHS. This sets a clear context linking NAT1 gene variants to asthma susceptibility under specific environmental conditions.

2. **Study Design and Population**: The research involved genotyping for NAT1 variants in children from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS), with additional findings replicated in a separate Genomic Control Cohort (GCC). This robust design enhances the reliability of the results.

3. **Measurement of Smoke Exposure**: Smoke exposure was quantitatively assessed using hair cotinine levels, a biomarker for nicotine intake, and supplemented with parental reports, providing a comprehensive measure of SHS exposure.

4. **Results - Association of NAT1 Variants with Asthma**:
   - **Primary Cohort**: Significant associations were found between five NAT1 variants and asthma in the group exposed to SHS, with no such associations in the unexposed group. This indicates a potential interaction between NAT1 genetic variations and environmental exposure to smoke in the development of asthma.
   - **Interaction Effects**: There was a statistically significant interaction between specific NAT1 variants (rs13253389 and rs4921581) and smoke exposure, as well as with hair cotinine levels. This suggests that NAT1 variants modulate the effect of SHS exposure on asthma risk.
   - **Replication in GCC**: In the replication cohort, similar associations were observed, reinforcing the findings from the primary study group.

5. **Gene-Environment Interaction**: The differential risk patterns observed in children with and without the NAT1 minor alleles in relation to cotinine levels highlight a gene-environment interaction. Children with the minor allele had an increased risk of asthma that was less dependent on the degree of SHS exposure compared to those with the wildtype allele.

6. **Conclusions and Clinical Implications**: The study concludes that NAT1 variations modify the risk of asthma in children exposed to SHS. This conclusion is significant as it not only confirms the role of NAT1 variations in asthma but also identifies a specific environmental interaction. This could have implications for identifying at-risk children and potentially guiding interventions to mitigate their asthma risk.

**Summary**: Overall, the abstract provides clear and strong evidence that variations in the NAT1 gene are associated with an increased risk of asthma in children exposed to secondhand smoke. The study effectively demonstrates a gene-environment interaction, where NAT1 polymorphisms modify the impact of environmental smoke exposure on asthma susceptibility, supporting the initial statement."	We previously reported that children exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) that carried variants in the NAT1 gene had over two-fold higher hair cotinine levels. Our objective was to determine if NAT1 polymorphisms confer increased risk for developing asthma in children exposed to SHS. White participants in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (<i>n</i> = 359) were genotyped for 10 <i>NAT1</i> variants. Smoke exposure was defined by hair cotinine and parental report. Asthma was objectively assessed by spirometry and methacholine challenge. Findings were replicated in the Genomic Control Cohort (<i>n</i> = 638). Significant associations between 5 <i>NAT1</i> variants and asthma were observed in the CCAAPS exposed group compared to none in the unexposed group. There was a significant interaction between <i>NAT1</i> rs13253389 and rs4921581 with smoke exposure (<i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and hair cotinine level (<i>p</i> = 0.048, <i>p</i> = 0.042). Children wildtype for rs4921581 had increasing asthma risk with increasing hair cotinine level, whereas those carrying the <i>NAT1</i> minor allele had an increased risk of asthma regardless of cotinine level. In the GCC, 13 <i>NAT1</i> variants were associated with asthma in the smoke-exposed group, compared to 0 in the unexposed group, demonstrating gene-level replication. Variation in the <i>NAT1</i> gene modifies asthma risk in children exposed to secondhand-smoke. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gene-environment interaction between <i>NAT1</i> variants, smoke exposure, cotinine levels, and pediatric asthma. <i>NAT1</i> genotype may have clinical utility as a biomarker of increased asthma risk in children exposed to smoke.
70	7627961	Variations in NAT1 contribute to colorectal cancer risk	NAT1	Colorectal cancer	1	"The biomedical abstract provides support for the statement that variations in NAT1 contribute to colorectal cancer risk. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the abstract supports this statement:

1. **Study Objective and Context**: The study aimed to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in NAT1 (and NAT2) and colorectal cancer risk, focusing on the role of these enzymes in metabolizing carcinogenic aromatic amines from diet, cigarette smoke, or environmental exposure. NAT1 and NAT2 can acetylate these compounds, leading to either their activation or detoxification.

2. **Study Design and Population**: The research analyzed genetic polymorphisms in both NAT1 and NAT2 among 202 colorectal cancer patients and 112 control subjects from Staffordshire, England. Such a case-control study design is appropriate for examining associations between genetic variants and disease risk.

3. **Findings on NAT1 Variations**:
   - **Association with Colorectal Cancer**: The study identified a significant association between colorectal cancer risk and the NAT1*10 allele, an allele that contains a variant polyadenylation signal. The reported odds ratio was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2; P = 0.009), indicating a nearly twofold increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with this NAT1 allele.
   - **Association with Tumor Stage**: Further analysis revealed that individuals with higher stage tumors (Duke's C) were more likely to carry the NAT1*10 allele, with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.7; P = 0.005), suggesting a link between this genetic variation and more advanced disease.

4. **Gene-Gene Interaction**:
   - **Interaction with NAT2**: The risk associated with the NAT1*10 allele was most apparent among individuals who were rapid acetylators according to their NAT2 genotype. This subgroup had an odds ratio of 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.7; P = 0.003), indicating a significant gene-gene interaction, although the test for interaction itself was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).

5. **Conclusions and Implications**:
   - **Significance of NAT1 in Colorectal Cancer**: This study is highlighted as the first to test cancer risk associated with the NAT1 gene explicitly. The findings strongly suggest that NAT1 alleles, particularly NAT1*10, are important genetic determinants of colorectal cancer risk. The interaction with NAT2 genotypes further suggests a complex interplay of genetic factors influencing the metabolism of carcinogens and the subsequent cancer risk.

**Summary**: The abstract supports the statement that variations in NAT1 contribute to colorectal cancer risk by demonstrating a significant association between the NAT1*10 allele and increased risk of colorectal cancer, especially among individuals with specific NAT2 genotypes. This suggests that NAT1 variations can affect the body’s handling of carcinogenic compounds, thereby influencing colorectal cancer susceptibility."	Exposure to carcinogens present in the diet, cigarette smoke, or the environment may be associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Aromatic amines (aryl- and heterocyclic) are a class of carcinogens that are important in these exposures. These compounds can be N- or O-acetylated by the NAT1 or NAT2 enzymes, resulting in activation or in some cases detoxification. Recent studies have shown that both NAT2 and NAT1 genes exhibit variation in human populations and that rapid acetylation by the NAT2 enzyme may be a risk factor for colorectal cancer. In this study we have analyzed for genetic polymorphism in both NAT1 and NAT2 in a group of 202 colorectal cancer patients and 112 control subjects from Staffordshire, England. We find significantly increased risk (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2; P = 0.009) associated with the NAT1*10 allele of NAT1, an allele that contains a variant polyadenylation signal. Individuals with higher stage tumors (Duke's C) were more likely to inherit this variant allele (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.7; P = 0.005). In contrast, rapid acetylation genotypes of NAT2 were not a significant risk factor in this English population. However, we found that the risk associated with the NAT1 variant allele (NAT1*10) was most apparent among NAT2 rapid acetylators (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.7; P = 0.003), suggesting a possible gene-gene interaction between NAT1 and NAT2 (test for interaction; P = 0.12). This is the first study to test for cancer risk associated with the NAT1 gene, and these positive findings suggest that NAT1 alleles may be important genetic determinents of colorectal cancer risk.
71	27616475	Variations in NAT1 increase the risk of gastroschisis 	NAT1	gastroschisis 	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that variations in NAT1 increase the risk of gastroschisis. Instead, it suggests the opposite:

1. **Results for NAT1**: The study found a significant association between a variant of the NAT1 gene and a decreased risk of gastroschisis. The odds ratio (ORv) for this association is 0.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9). This odds ratio below 1 indicates a protective effect, meaning that the presence of this NAT1 variant actually reduces the risk of gastroschisis, rather than increases it.

2. **Study Design and Analysis**: This was a well-designed population-based case-control study that included a comprehensive analysis of 75 genetic variants in 20 genes related to the risk of gastroschisis, considering environmental factors such as smoking and vitamin use. The use of logistic regression to estimate risks further strengthens the reliability of the findings.

3. **Interpretation of Results**: The finding that the NAT1 variant is associated with a decreased risk of gastroschisis contradicts the statement that NAT1 variations increase the risk. It is crucial to note that the statistical significance (P = 0.009) supports a strong association of this variant with a protective effect against gastroschisis.

4. **Overall Conclusion**: The abstract concludes that while several genes showed a significant correlation with gastroschisis risk, NAT1 specifically showed an association with a reduced risk. This result indicates that NAT1, at least in the context of this study's population and genetic variants analyzed, is not a risk factor for increasing gastroschisis but rather appears to have a protective role.

In summary, the evidence from this abstract contradicts the claim that variations in NAT1 increase the risk of gastroschisis. Instead, it supports that certain variants of NAT1 may decrease the risk of developing this condition."	In a population-based case-control study in California of 228 infants, we investigated 75 genetic variants in 20 genes and risk of gastroschisis with regard to maternal age, race/ethnicity, vitamin use, and smoking exposure. We hypothesized that genes related to vascular compromise may interact with environmental factors to affect the risk of gastroschisis. Haplotypes were constructed for 75 gene variants using the HaploView program. Risk for gastroschisis associated with each gene variant was calculated for both the homozygotes and the heterozygotes, with the homozygous wildtypes as the referent. Risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by logistic regression. We found 11 gene variants with increased risk and four variants with decreased risk of gastroschisis for heterozygous (OR<sub>h</sub> ) or homozygous variants (OR<sub>v</sub> ) genotypes. These included NOS3 (rs1036145) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.7); NOS3 (rs10277237) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3-6.0); ADD1 (rs12503220) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6-5.4), GNB3 (rs5443) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.5), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9); ICAM1 (rs281428) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 6.9 (95% CI: 2.1-22.9), ICAM1 (rs3093030) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.2-5.6); ICAM4 (rs281438) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 4.9 (95% CI: 1.4-16.6), ICAM5 (rs281417) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.1), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 4.8 (95% CI: 1.7-13.6); ICAM5 (rs281440) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 23.7 (95% CI: 5.5-102.5), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 20.6 (95% CI: 3.4-124.3); ICAM5 (rs2075741) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.2 (95% CI: 1.1-4.4); NAT1 OR<sub>v</sub>  = 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-0.9). There were additional associations between several gene variants and gastroschisis among women aged 20-24 and among mothers with and without vitamin use. NOS3, ADD1, ICAM1, ICAM4, and ICAM5 warrant further investigation in additional populations and with the interaction of additional environmental exposures. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
72	29305299	Disruption in OAF can lead to Keratolenticular dysgenesis (KLD)	OAF	Keratolenticular dysgenesis (KLD)	1	"The biomedical abstract provides evidence to support the statement that disruption in the OAF gene can lead to Keratolenticular dysgenesis (KLD). Here’s how the abstract supports this statement:

1. **Chromosomal Translocation and Gene Disruption**: The study describes a patient with a congenital eye defect (KLD) and neurological impairment, who has a de novo balanced chromosome translocation t(11;18)(q23.3;q11.2). This translocation disrupts the OAF gene at the 11q23.3 breakpoint. 

2. **Reduced Expression and Chimeric Transcripts**: The disruption results in reduced expression of OAF and the generation of most likely nonfunctional chimeric transcripts up to OAF exon 3, derived from the derivative chromosome 11. Such changes in gene expression are significant as they directly implicate the loss of normal OAF function in the patient’s phenotype.

3. **OAF's Role in Eye Development**: Further strengthening the case, the abstract notes that OAF is significantly enriched in the lens from early stages of development through to adulthood. This specific expression pattern during critical stages of ocular development indicates OAF's pivotal role in normal eye formation and its likely involvement in the development of KLD when disrupted.

4. **Additional Genetic Effects and Gene Expression Changes**: Besides the disruption of OAF, the expression of PVRL1 (a gene associated with congenital ocular defects) located upstream of the 11q23.3 breakpoint is increased, suggesting a position effect that may also contribute to the phenotype. The combination of OAF disruption and altered PVRL1 expression likely synergizes to influence the development of KLD.

5. **Clinical Relevance and Implications**: The unique genomic changes in the patient, coupled with the gene expression findings in both human samples and normal murine ocular lens embryogenesis, align well with the clinical presentation of KLD. The gene interaction topology data for PVRL1 supporting this linkage further consolidates the role of the disrupted OAF gene in the pathogenesis of KLD.

In conclusion, the abstract provides strong molecular genetic evidence linking the disruption of the OAF gene to the development of Keratolenticular dysgenesis. This supports the assertion that mutations or disruptions in OAF can be a causal factor for this specific type of congenital eye defect."	Keratolenticular dysgenesis (KLD) and ectopia lentis are congenital eye defects. The aim of this study is the identification of molecular genetic alterations responsible for those ocular anomalies with neurologic impairment in an individual with a de novo balanced chromosome translocation t(11;18)(q23.3;q11.2)dn. Disruption of OAF, the human orthologue of the Drosophila oaf, by the 11q23.3 breakpoint results in reduced expression of this transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, four most likely nonfunctional chimeric transcripts comprising up to OAF exon 3, derived from the der(11) allele, have also been identified. This locus has been implicated by publicly available genome-wide association data in corneal disease and corneal topography. The expression of the poliovirus receptor-related 1(PVRL1) or nectin cell adhesion molecule 1 (NECTIN1), a paralogue of nectin cell adhesion molecule 3 (PVRL3) associated with congenital ocular defects, situated 500 kb upstream from 11q23.3 breakpoint, is increased. The 18q11.2 breakpoint is localized between cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen 1(CTAGE1) and retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8) genes. Genomic imbalance that could contribute to the observed phenotype was excluded. Analysis of gene expression datasets throughout normal murine ocular lens embryogenesis suggests that OAF expression is significantly enriched in the lens from early stages of development through adulthood, whereas PVRL1 is lens-enriched until E12.5 and then down-regulated. This contrasts with the observation that the proposita's lymphoblastoid cell lines exhibit low OAF and high PVRL1 expression as compared to control, which offers further support that the alterations described above are most likely responsible for the clinical phenotype. Finally, gene interaction topology data for PVRL1 also agree with our proposal that disruption of OAF by the translocation breakpoint and misregulation of PVRL1 due to a position effect contribute to the observed ocular and neurological phenotype.
73	29582521	Mutations is OAS3 are correlated with Hepatitiis B	OAS3	Hepatitis B	1	"The biomedical abstract indeed supports the statement that mutations in OAS3 are correlated with hepatitis B, specifically the unusual clinical phenomenon of the coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) in patients. Here's how the abstract substantiates this correlation:

1. **Study Design and Objectives**: The study conducted a detailed genetic analysis in two stages within the Chinese Han population to explore the host genetic factors linked to the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs, a phenomenon observed in some hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

2. **Genetic Analysis**: Initially, whole exome sequencing was performed, followed by a specific focus on the OAS3 gene. This gene was chosen possibly due to its known role in immune response to viral infections.

3. **Findings in OAS3**: The first stage of the study did not find genome-wide significant loci but highlighted that rare variants in the OAS3 gene were associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs. The gene-based burden analysis showed a significant association (P-value = 4.127e-06), suggesting that variants in OAS3 contribute to this clinical presentation.

4. **Validation and Further Analysis**: In the second stage, direct sequencing of OAS3 in additional cohorts found rare coding sequence mutations significantly more frequent in cases than in controls (P-value = 7.299e-09, OR = 17.27). This strong association and the high odds ratio further emphasize the role of OAS3 mutations in this specific phenotype of hepatitis B.

5. **Clinical and Biological Implications**: The identification of rare mutations in OAS3 among individuals exhibiting both HBsAg and anti-HBs implies a potential genetic predisposition facilitated by these mutations that affect the immune response to HBV, possibly influencing the virus's detection and the immune system's response.

6. **Conclusion**: The study conclusively suggests that protein-coding rare variations in OAS3 are associated with the simultaneous presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in chronic HBV infection among the Chinese Han population. This finding not only supports the correlation between OAS3 mutations and hepatitis B but also underscores the genetic complexity influencing the clinical course of HBV infection.

Thus, the abstract provides robust evidence that mutations in the OAS3 gene are linked to a specific and rare manifestation of hepatitis B, highlighting the gene's role in the pathophysiology of the disease."	The underlying mechanism of coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (anti-HBs) is still controversial. To identify the host genetic factors related to this unusual clinical phenomenon, a two-stage study was conducted in the Chinese Han population. In the first stage, we performed a case-control (1:1) age- and gender-matched study of 101 cases with concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs and 102 controls with negative HBsAg and positive anti-HBs using whole exome sequencing. In the second validation stage, we directly sequence the 16 exons on the OAS3 gene in two dependent cohorts of 48 cases and 200 controls. Although, in the first stage, a genome-wide association study of 58,563 polymorphism variants in 101 cases and 102 controls found no significant loci (P-value ≤ .05/58563), and neither locus achieved a conservative genome-wide significance threshold (P-value ≤ 5e-08), gene-based burden analysis showed that OAS3 gene rare variants were associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs. (P-value = 4.127e-06 ≤ 0.05/6994). A total of 16 rare variants were screened out from 21 cases and 3 controls. In the second validation stage, one case with a stop-gained rare variant was identified. Fisher's exact test of all 149 cases and 302 controls showed that the rare coding sequence mutations were more frequent in cases vs controls (P-value = 7.299e-09, OR = 17.27, 95% CI [5.01-58.72]). Protein-coding rare variations on the OAS3 gene are associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in patients with chronic HBV infection in Chinese Han population.
74	36706688	Variations in OAS3 are a primary factor in HIV progression	OAS3	HIV-1	0	"The biomedical abstract does not directly support the statement that variations in OAS3 are a primary factor in HIV progression, but it does provide insights into the role of OAS3 expression in the neurological complications associated with AIDS, particularly HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Here’s how the abstract contributes to the understanding of OAS3's involvement:

1. **OAS3 Expression Levels**: The study indicates that OAS3 expression is significantly higher in brain samples from patients with HAND/HIVE and HAND/HIVE treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to non-demented HIV-negative controls (NDC). This suggests a role of OAS3 in the neuroimmune response in these conditions.

2. **Diagnostic Capability of OAS3 Expression**: OAS3 shows a strong diagnostic ability to distinguish between various groups such as NDC and HAND/HIVE, as well as HAND from HAND/HIVE/ART. This points to its potential utility as a biomarker in neuroAIDS.

3. **Correlation with Viral Load**: Importantly, the study finds that higher OAS3 expression in the brains of patients with HAND/HIVE correlates positively with the viral load in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This correlation suggests that OAS3 expression might be a response to the viral burden or an indicator of viral activity within the central nervous system.

4. **Inflammatory and Neuronal Activation**: The genomic deconvolution analysis showed that genes positively correlated with OAS3 expression were associated with inflammatory responses, while those negatively correlated were linked to neuronal activation. This indicates that OAS3 might be involved in the modulation of both inflammatory processes and neuronal functions during HIV infection.

5. **Immune and Neurological Implications**: The association of OAS3 expression with inflammatory transcriptomic signatures and its potential link to cognitive impairment in HAND/HIVE patients further suggest that OAS3 might play a role in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS.

**Conclusion**:
While the abstract provides significant evidence of OAS3's involvement in the neurological manifestations of HIV, it does not directly address whether variations in the OAS3 gene itself are a primary factor in general HIV progression. Instead, it focuses on the implications of altered OAS3 expression in the context of neuroAIDS. The findings highlight OAS3's role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the setting of HIV, but additional research would be needed to establish if genetic variations in OAS3 directly influence the overall progression of HIV disease."	Neurological complications of AIDS (NeuroAIDS) include primary HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). OAS3 is an enzyme belonging to the 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthase family induced by type I interferons and involved in the degradation of both viral and endogenous RNA. Here, we used microarray datasets from NCBI of brain samples of non-demented HIV-negative controls (NDC), HIV, deceased patients with HAND and encephalitis (HIVE) (treated and untreated with antiretroviral therapy, ART), and with HAND without HIVE. The HAND/HIVE patients were stratified according to the OAS3 gene expression. The genes positively and negatively correlated to the OAS3 gene expression were used to perform a genomic deconvolution analysis using neuroimmune signatures (NIS) belonging to sixteen signatures. Expression analysis revealed significantly higher OAS3 expression in HAND/HIVE and HAND/HIVE/ART compared with NDC. OAS3 expressed an excellent diagnostic ability to discriminate NDC from HAND/HIVE, HAND from HAND/HIVE, HAND from HAND/HIVE/ART, and HIV from HAND/HIVE. Noteworthy, OAS3 expression levels in the brains of HAND/HIVE patients were positively correlated with viral load in both peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, deconvolution analysis revealed that the genes positively correlated to OAS3 expression were associated with inflammatory signatures. Neuronal activation profiles were significantly activated by the genes negatively correlated to OAS3 expression levels. Moreover, gene ontology analysis performed on genes characterizing the microglia signature highlighted an immune response as a main biological process. According to our results, genes positively correlated to OAS3 gene expression in the brains of HAND/HIVE patients are associated with inflammatory transcriptomic signatures and likely worse cognitive impairment.
75	36127160	OAS3 activity is associated with severe COVID-19	OAS3	COVID-19	1	"The biomedical abstract indeed supports the statement that OAS3 activity is associated with severe COVID-19. Here's how the abstract contributes to this assertion:

1. **Identification of OAS3**: The study identifies 2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 3 (OAS3) as one of the top five most associated protein-coding genes with severe COVID-19 through a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis. This analysis explores the causal association between gene expression and severe COVID-19 outcomes using eQTL data from multiple tissues.

2. **Genetic Association**: OAS3 was pinpointed as significantly associated with severe COVID-19 phenotypes. This suggests a potential causal role for OAS3 in the severity of the disease, likely due to its involvement in immune response pathways, particularly those related to interferon signaling.

3. **Biological Relevance**: OAS3 is known for its role in the immune response, especially in the synthesis of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates that activate RNase L, leading to the degradation of viral RNA. Its association with severe COVID-19 aligns with the understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology, where an impaired or overactive immune response can exacerbate disease severity.

4. **Context of Study**: The study used a robust genetic approach (Mendelian randomization) that reduces the likelihood of confounding factors and biases typically present in observational studies. This strengthens the claim that the association between OAS3 and severe COVID-19 could be causal rather than merely correlational.

5. **Enrichment in Biological Processes**: The significant genes, including OAS3, were enriched in biological processes related to type I interferons and other immune response pathways critical in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19.

**Conclusion**:
The abstract strongly supports the statement that OAS3 activity is associated with severe COVID-19, suggesting that genetic variations affecting OAS3 expression or function might influence the severity of the disease. This highlights the importance of OAS3 in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and potentially offers a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at moderating the immune response in severe COVID-19 cases."	Severe COVID-19 has a poor prognosis, while the genetic mechanism underlying severe COVID-19 remains largely unknown. We aimed to identify genes that are potentially causally associated with severe COVID-19. We conducted a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from 49 different tissues as the exposure and three COVID-19-phenotypes (very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 [severe COVID-19], hospitalized COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infection) as the outcomes. SMR using multiple SNPs was used as a sensitivity analysis to reduce false positive rate. Multiple testing was corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) q-value. We identified 309 significant gene-trait associations (FDR q value < 0.05) across 46 tissues for severe COVID-19, which mapped to 64 genes, of which 38 are novel. The top five most associated protein-coding genes were Interferon Alpha and Beta Receptor Subunit 2 (IFNAR2), 2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 3 (OAS3), mucin 1 (MUC1), Interleukin 10 Receptor Subunit Beta (IL10RB), and Napsin A Aspartic Peptidase (NAPSA). The potential causal genes were enriched in biological processes related to type I interferons, interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 production, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 production. In addition, we further identified 23 genes and 5 biological processes which are unique to hospitalized COVID-19, as well as 13 genes that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified several genes that are potentially causally associated with severe COVID-19. These findings improve our limited understanding of the mechanism of COVID-19 and shed light on the development of therapeutic agents for treating severe COVID-19.
76	37469105	Mutations in ODC1 cause Bachmann-Bupp syndrome	ODC1	Bachmann-Bupp syndrome	1	"This biomedical abstract does support the statement that mutations in the ODC1 gene cause Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS). Here are the specific reasons based on the details provided in the abstract:

1. **Gene Mutation Identification**: The abstract clearly states that Bachmann-Bupp syndrome is caused by 3'-end mutations in the ODC1 gene. These mutations lead to the production of carboxy (C)-terminally truncated variants of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme.

2. **Impact of the Mutation**: It explains that the truncation prevents the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of the ODC enzyme, resulting in its accumulation within cells. This accumulated enzyme remains catalytically active, which disrupts normal cellular functions.

3. **Connection to Disease Mechanism**: The abstract links the accumulation of active ODC to the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, where ODC catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine, a key step in the synthesis of polyamines. Polyamines are critical for various physiological processes including embryogenesis and organogenesis, implying that their dysregulation due to ODC accumulation could contribute to the symptoms observed in BABS.

4. **Clinical Relevance and Treatment**: Further supporting the causal role of ODC1 mutations in BABS, the abstract discusses the use of α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an ODC inhibitor, in treating patients with BABS. The reported clinical improvements in hair growth, muscle tone, and development upon treatment with DFMO provide practical evidence of the link between ODC1 mutations and the syndrome.

5. **Overall Contribution to Knowledge**: The description of the syndrome and its association with ODC1 mutations adds valuable insight into the genetic and molecular basis of BABS, emphasizing the role of ODC1 as critical in its pathogenesis.

In summary, the abstract supports the statement by detailing how mutations in ODC1 lead to the production of a dysfunctional protein that contributes directly to the phenotype of Bachmann-Bupp syndrome and how targeting this pathway can mitigate some of the clinical symptoms."	Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and varying forms of non-congenital alopecia. The condition is caused by 3'-end mutations of the ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene, which produce carboxy (C)-terminally truncated variants of ODC, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme. C-terminal truncation of ODC prevents its ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and leads to cellular accumulation of ODC enzyme that remains catalytically active. ODC is the first rate-limiting enzyme that converts ornithine to putrescine in the polyamine pathway. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are aliphatic molecules found in all forms of life and are important during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. BABS is an ultra-rare condition with few reported cases, but it serves as a convincing example for drug repurposing therapy. α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, also known as eflornithine) is an ODC inhibitor with a strong safety profile in pediatric use for neuroblastoma and other cancers as well as West African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Patients with BABS have been treated with DFMO and have shown improvement in hair growth, muscle tone, and development.
77	35738259	Decreased ODC1 is a contributor to Alzheimer's disease	ODC1	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract provided does not support the statement that decreased ODC1 is a contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Instead, it presents a scenario where inhibiting ODC1 (thereby decreasing its activity) is proposed as a beneficial approach for AD treatment. Here's a breakdown based on the abstract:

1. **Role of ODC1 in Astrocytes**: The abstract explains that in the context of AD, where astrocytes are responsible for clearing beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, the presence of Aβ induces a switch in astrocytic metabolism towards an active urea cycle. This change is associated with increased levels of aspartate, ammonia, urea, and the side-product putrescine, which is produced from ornithine through the action of ODC1.

2. **Impact of Putrescine Accumulation**: The production of putrescine, facilitated by ODC1, leads to an accumulation of toxic byproducts such as ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and also affects levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These changes contribute to reactive astrogliosis and memory impairment, key features of AD.

3. **Beneficial Effects of ODC1 Inhibition**: By silencing (inhibiting) ODC1, the study observes a reduction in putrescine and its harmful byproducts. This inhibition also enhances the urea cycle's capacity to detoxify Aβ, alleviating reactive astrogliosis and improving memory functions in AD models.

4. **Therapeutic Proposal**: Contrary to the idea that decreased ODC1 contributes to AD, the abstract proposes that inhibiting ODC1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. This would help in removing toxic molecules and preventing memory loss, indicating that higher, not lower, ODC1 activity might be associated with AD pathology due to its role in producing harmful byproducts.

In conclusion, the abstract argues for the benefits of decreasing ODC1 activity as a therapeutic approach in AD, rather than suggesting that decreased ODC1 levels are a contributing factor to the disease. This presents a therapeutic paradox where the inhibition of an enzyme, which in other contexts might be detrimental, is beneficial in the specific metabolic environment altered by AD pathology."	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the foremost neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and significant progressive memory loss. In AD, astrocytes are proposed to take up and clear Aβ plaques. However, how Aβ induces pathogenesis and memory impairment in AD remains elusive. We report that normal astrocytes show non-cyclic urea metabolism, whereas Aβ-treated astrocytes show switched-on urea cycle with upregulated enzymes and accumulated entering-metabolite aspartate, starting-substrate ammonia, end-product urea, and side-product putrescine. Gene silencing of astrocytic ornithine decarboxylase-1 (ODC1), facilitating ornithine-to-putrescine conversion, boosts urea cycle and eliminates aberrant putrescine and its toxic byproducts ammonia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its end product GABA to recover from reactive astrogliosis and memory impairment in AD. Our findings implicate that astrocytic urea cycle exerts opposing roles of beneficial Aβ detoxification and detrimental memory impairment in AD. We propose ODC1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD to facilitate removal of toxic molecules and prevent memory loss.
78	30239107	Mutations of ODC1 is proven to correlate with alopecia	ODC1	alopecia	0	"The biomedical abstract provides evidence that mutations in the ODC1 gene are associated with alopecia among other symptoms, but it doesn't unequivocally prove that ODC1 mutations are a direct and consistent cause of alopecia in all cases. Here’s why:

1. **Single Case Report**: The abstract discusses a single case of a patient with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene exhibiting multiple symptoms, including alopecia. While this case strongly suggests a link between the ODC1 mutation and alopecia, it's important to note that proof of correlation in a broader sense would require data from multiple cases and ideally, a larger population study.

2. **Phenotypic Variability**: The patient described shows a range of symptoms (macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, etc.), indicating that the ODC1 mutation has diverse effects, which could vary widely between individuals. The occurrence of alopecia along with other varied symptoms suggests a complex interaction of genetic and possibly environmental factors.

3. **Functional Evidence**: The mutation results in elevated levels of ODC protein and polyamines, which are known to be involved in cell growth and differentiation processes. This supports the notion that disruptions in these pathways could contribute to abnormal tissue development, including hair follicle function. However, the specific mechanisms by which the ODC1 mutation leads to alopecia are not detailed, and the direct causative pathway remains to be fully elucidated.

4. **Comparison with Animal Models**: The reference to similar symptoms in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model helps strengthen the case that the mutation could contribute to the observed human phenotype, including alopecia. However, translating findings from animal models to humans always requires careful validation.

5. **Therapeutic Insight**: Mention of potential treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine (an ODC inhibitor) suggests a functional link between ODC activity and the disease phenotype. If this treatment is effective, particularly in alleviating alopecia, it could further support the role of ODC1 in this condition.

In summary, the abstract provides compelling evidence for a possible link between a specific mutation in ODC1 and alopecia within the context of a complex multisymptom disorder in one patient. However, it stops short of proving a broad, consistent correlation between ODC1 mutations and alopecia across a wider population, highlighting the need for further research to establish a definitive causal relationship."	The ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene plays an important role in physiological and cell developmental processes including embryogenesis, organogenesis, and neoplastic cell growth. Here, we report an 32-month-old Caucasian female with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene that leads to a premature abrogation of 14-aa residues at the ODC protein c-terminus. This is the first human case confirming similar symptoms observed in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model first described over 20 years ago. Phenotypic manifestations include macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, spasticity, hypotonia, cutaneous vascular malformation, delayed visual maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. We here describe for the first time a new pediatric disorder that is directly linked to a de novo pathogenic variant in the ODC1 gene. The ODC1 gene mutation (c.1342 A>T) was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Red blood cells obtained from our patient showed elevated ODC protein and polyamine levels compared to healthy controls. Our autosomal dominant patient who carries this gain-of-function ODC1 mutation may benefit from treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine, a well-tolerated, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA-approved drug.
79	18805672	PAK3 mutations are associated with schizophrenia in all cases	PAK3	schizophrenia	0	"This biomedical abstract does not support the statement that PAK3 mutations are associated with schizophrenia in all cases. Here's why:

1. **Specific Subtype Association**: The study specifically investigates the association of PAK3 mutations with schizophrenia in patients who do not have premorbid mental retardation (MR). The findings suggest that while PAK3 mutations are known to be linked with cognitive developmental issues and psychotic disorders including a specific type called ""pfropfschizophrenie"" (where schizophrenia involves premorbid MR), such mutations are not common in cases of schizophrenia without premorbid MR.

2. **Low Frequency of Deleterious Variants**: The research identifies that deleterious variants in PAK3 are rare in the subgroup of schizophrenia patients without premorbid MR (found in less than 0.6% of the cases studied). This indicates that while PAK3 may be a biological candidate for certain forms of psychosis, it is not a general factor in the broader spectrum of schizophrenia cases, especially those without intellectual disability.

3. **Distinction in Phenotype Association**: The study underscores the importance of distinguishing between different phenotypes of schizophrenia when considering genetic factors. The link between PAK3 mutations and schizophrenia seems to be confined to cases with associated cognitive impairments (intellectual disabilities) prior to the onset of schizophrenia.

4. **Implication for Genetic Testing and Research**: These findings suggest that genetic testing for PAK3 mutations in schizophrenia patients without prior intellectual disability might not be as beneficial or informative. It also implies that future genetic research and therapeutic interventions might need to consider the specific subtypes of schizophrenia for more targeted analysis.

Overall, the study detailed in the abstract provides a clear differentiation in the association of PAK3 mutations with schizophrenia, supporting its connection only in cases with premorbid intellectual disabilities and not broadly across all schizophrenia cases."	"The P21-activated kinase PAK3 is critical for cognitive development and truncating mutations cause non-syndromic mental retardation (MR). Missense mutations are also associated with psychotic disorders, most commonly with schizophrenia involving premorbid MR, namely ""pfropfschizophrenie"". We set out to measure the frequency of sequence variants in PAK3 in schizophrenia without premorbid MR. We conducted complete gene reseqeuncing of all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries in patients with schizophrenia with cognitive impairment but without premorbid MR. Deleterious variants in schizophrenia alone were rare (<1/159 or 0.6%). Thereby, while PAK3 remains a strong biological candidate in psychosis, evidence from human genetics provides strongest support for a link to pfropfschizophrenie and not to schizophrenia without premorbid intellectual disability."

1. **Genetic Findings**: The study reports that among the 22 children with Noonan Syndrome who were enrolled and had cardiovascular abnormalities, RAF1 mutations were observed in a significant portion (27% of the cases). This finding is consistent with known genetic contributions to Noonan Syndrome, which is characterized by a spectrum of gene mutations including RAF1.

2. **Specific Cardiac Phenotypes**: The study specifically links mutations in RAF1 to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Noonan Syndrome patients. This genotype-phenotype correlation is crucial as it helps in understanding the specific clinical manifestations associated with RAF1 mutations in NS, distinguishing it from other genetic mutations which may lead to different cardiac anomalies like pulmonary valve stenosis which are more commonly linked to mutations in other genes like RIT1, SOS1, PTPN11, and SOS2.

3. **Clinical Relevance**: The identification of RAF1 mutations in patients with NS and their association with specific cardiac manifestations (HCM) can guide clinical management. Knowing that RAF1 mutations may predispose to HCM allows for targeted monitoring and interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes.

4. **Prognostic Implications**: The abstract also mentions that RAF1 genotypes are considered poor prognostic factors in Noonan Syndrome, indicating that these mutations may lead to more severe disease progression or complications, which could require multiple medical interventions.

5. **Therapeutic Implications**: Understanding the specific mutations and their associated phenotypes helps in developing more personalized and effective treatment strategies. For instance, knowing the specific cardiac risks associated with RAF1 mutations can help in tailoring surveillance and treatment protocols to better manage or mitigate these risks.

Overall, the abstract provides evidence that mutations in RAF1 are not only associated with Noonan Syndrome but also detail the specific cardiac phenotype (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) linked to these mutations, thus supporting the statement regarding their association with the condition."	<b>Background:</b> Common cardiac abnormalities in Noonan syndrome (NS) include congenital heart diseases (CHD), pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Molecular diagnoses are enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis of patients who have a subtle or atypical presentation. The aims of this study were to investigate genotype-phenotype associations with respect to Noonan syndrome (NS)-associated cardiac abnormalities and catheter or surgery-based interventions conditions. <b>Methods:</b> From January 2019 to December 2021, 22 children with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of NS combined with cardiovascular abnormalities were consecutively enrolled into the current study. A comprehensive review was carried out of echocardiography and electrocardiogram results, second-generation whole-exome sequencing results and catheter or surgery-based interventions conditions. <b>Results:</b> The main manifestations of electrocardiogram abnormalities were QTc prolongation, abnormal Q wave in the precordial lead and limb lead, right ventricular hypertrophy and left or right deviation of the electrical axis. The most commonly detected abnormality was pulmonary valve dysplasia with stenosis, seen in 15 (68.2%) patients, followed by atrial septal defect in 11 (50%) patients. Seven genes (<i>RAF1</i>, <i>RIT1</i>, <i>SOS1</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>SOS2</i>, and <i>LZTR1</i>) were found to contain disease-associated variants<i>.</i> The most commonly observed genetic mutations were <i>PTPN11</i> (27%) and <i>RAF1</i> (27%)<i>.</i> Each genotype was associated with specific phenotypic findings. <i>RIT1</i>, <i>SOS1</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, and <i>SOS2</i> had common echocardiography features characterized by pulmonary valve stenosis, while <i>RAF1</i> was characterized by HCM. Interestingly, patients with <i>BRAF</i> mutations were not only characterized by HCM, but also by pulmonary valve stenosis. In the cohort there was only one patient carrying a <i>LZTR1</i> mutation characterized by left ventricle globose dilation. Ten cases underwent catheter or surgery-based interventions. All the operations had immediate results and high success rates. However, some of the cases had adverse outcomes during extended follow-up. Based on the genotype-phenotype associations observed during follow-up, <i>BRAF</i> and <i>RAF1</i> genotypes seem to be poor prognostic factors, and multiple interventions may be required for NS patients with severe pulmonary stenosis or myectomy for HCM. <b>Conclusions:</b> The identification of causal genes in NS patients has enabled the evaluation of genotype-cardiac phenotype relationships and prognosis of the disease. This may be beneficial for the development of therapeutic approaches.
81	20389169	Increased expression of RAF1 is associated with cryptorchidism	RAF1	cryptorchidism	0	"The biomedical abstract you provided does not support the statement that increased expression of RAF1 is associated with cryptorchidism. In fact, the findings from this study indicate the opposite:

1. **Expression Levels**: The study found that RAF1, along with FGFR1 and SOS1, was expressed less in undescended testes compared to descended testes. This suggests a downregulation of RAF1 in the context of cryptorchidism.

2. **Implications for Cryptorchidism**: The abstract suggests that a subtle dysfunction (including lower expression) of RAF1 might be involved in the development of cryptorchidism. This is contrary to the statement that increased expression of RAF1 is associated with this condition.

3. **Gene Function Context**: Cryptorchidism is the most common male reproductive tract disorder, and the study aimed to analyze gene expression differences to better understand the genetic factors involved. The discovery that RAF1 is underexpressed in cryptorchid testes could indicate its potential role in normal testicular descent, which is disrupted when RAF1 expression is diminished.

4. **Study Focus and Results**: The focus of the study was on identifying differences in gene expression profiles between cryptorchid and descended testes, and the significant result concerning RAF1 was its reduced expression in cryptorchidism, suggesting a possible protective or necessary role of normal RAF1 levels in testicular descent.

In summary, the abstract actually indicates that decreased, not increased, expression of RAF1 might be involved in cryptorchidism, thus not supporting the initial statement."	In recent years, several genes were found to be involved in the process of epididymo-testicular descent, the most frequently cited ones include INSL3, HOXA10, GNRHR, and KAL1. In this study, we analyzed the differences in gene expression profiles between cryptorchid and descended testes. In particular, we analyzed expression of all recently published genes known to be associated with undescended testis. Twenty-two testicular biopsies from 18 boys were analyzed. We analyzed gene expression in 16 cryptorchid and 6 descended testes using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, and validated the results with qPCR. 3,688 transcripts were differentially expressed with an adjusted p value of <0.05 and a change of at least 1.5-fold. The list contained 1,866 downregulated and 1,822 upregulated transcripts in the cryptorchid testes. A novel observation in our study was that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) and its mediators SOS1 and RAF1 were expressed less in undescended testes. Based on our results, it is possible that a subtle dysfunction (expression) of the FGFR1, SOS1 and RAF1 genes is involved in the development of the most common male reproductive tract disorder - unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.
82	38433785	Mutations in RCL1 can increase resistance to Itraconazole 	RCL1	Itraconazole 	1	"The biomedical abstract you provided supports the statement that mutations in RCL1 can increase resistance to Itraconazole. Here's a breakdown of how the study's findings support this assertion:

1. **Mutation Identification**: The study identified specific mutations in the RCL1 gene (C6A, G10A, A11T, among others) within Itraconazole-resistant Candida albicans strains. This directly associates RCL1 genetic changes with resistance to this antifungal drug.

2. **Expression Analysis**: The abstract reports that RCL1 expression was significantly higher in Itraconazole-resistant strains compared to those sensitive to the drug under standard laboratory conditions. This elevated expression in resistant strains suggests that RCL1 plays a role in mediating resistance.

3. **Environmental Influence on Expression**: The study also explored how different environmental conditions affect RCL1 expression in both resistant and sensitive strains. The findings indicate that the expression of RCL1 responds variably to environmental changes, which might contribute to the adaptability and survival of resistant strains under drug treatment conditions.

4. **Role in Resistance Mechanism**: The implication of RCL1 in the resistance mechanism is supported by its overexpression in resistant strains and the identification of mutations that correlate with resistance. This suggests that RCL1 might be involved in the cellular pathways that contribute to Itraconazole resistance.

Overall, the study provides evidence that mutations in RCL1 not only occur in Itraconazole-resistant C. albicans but that these mutations, along with increased gene expression, are likely contributors to the resistance mechanism. This supports the hypothesis that RCL1 could be a target for understanding and potentially overcoming antifungal resistance in clinical settings."	RNA terminal phosphate cyclase like 1 (<i>RCL1</i>) undergoes overexpression during the immune response of <i>Candida albicans</i> following drug treatment. This study aims to investigate the expression levels of <i>RCL1</i> in <i>C. albicans</i> under various stress conditions. Fifteen itraconazole (ITR)-resistant strains of clinical <i>C. albicans</i>, and one standard strain were employed for <i>RCL1</i> sequencing, and mutations in <i>RCL1</i> were analyzed. Subsequently, 14 out of the 15 ITR-resistant clinical strains and 14 clinical strains sensitive to ITR, fluconazole (FCA) as well as voriconazole (VRC) were cultured under diverse conditions. The expression of <i>RCL1</i> ITR-resistant and sensitive <i>C. albicans</i> was then assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays. Compared to the standard strain, three missense mutations (C6A, G10A, and A11T) were identified in the <i>RCL1</i> gene of ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans</i> through successful forward sequencing. Additionally, using successful reverse sequencing, one synonymous mutation (C1T) and four missense mutations (C1T, A3T, A7G, and T8G) were found in the <i>RCL1</i> gene of ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans. RCL1</i> expression was significantly higher in ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans</i> than in sensitive strains under standard conditions (37°C, 0.03% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 4.0). Low temperature (25°C) increased <i>RCL1</i> expression in sensitive <i>C. albicans</i> while decreasing it in ITR-resistant strains. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) had a negligible effect on <i>RCL1</i> expression in sensitive <i>C. albicans</i>, but effectively reduced <i>RCL1</i> level in ITR-resistant strains. Furthermore, a medium with a pH of 7 decreased the expression of <i>RCL1</i> in both resistant and sensitive <i>C. albicans</i>. This study demonstrated that <i>RCL1</i> mutations in ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans</i>, and variations in culture conditions significantly influence <i>RCL1</i> expression in both ITR-resistant and sensitive <i>C. albicans</i>, thereby inducing alterations in the dimorphism of <i>C. albicans</i>.
83	36443250	Mutations in RGS2 are associated with schizophrenia	RGS2	Schizophrenia	0	"The biomedical abstract you provided suggests that mutations or differential expression in RGS2 are potentially associated with schizophrenia, particularly through findings that RGS2 is up-regulated in certain brain areas of individuals with the condition. Here’s why this supports the statement:

1. **Gene Expression Changes**: The study found that RGS2, along with RGS16, was up-regulated in Brodmann Area 10 (BA10) in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. This differential expression indicates a potential involvement of RGS2 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

2. **Location on Relevant Chromosome**: RGS2 is located on chromosome 1q23.3-31, which has been previously associated with schizophrenia. This locational relevance adds a genetic predisposition context to the expression findings.

3. **Role of RGS Proteins**: RGS proteins, including RGS2, regulate the signaling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which mediate the effects of several neurotransmitters implicated in schizophrenia. GPCRs are also targets for many antipsychotic drugs.

4. **Validation of Results**: The validation of up-regulation in another dataset (the CommonMind Consortium) reinforces the consistency and reliability of the findings regarding RGS2’s involvement in schizophrenia.

5. **Implication for Further Research**: The study concludes that further research is needed to explore the functional consequences of these expression changes, which suggests a recognized gap in understanding exactly how RGS2’s altered expression impacts schizophrenia’s pathology at the protein and functional levels.

While the abstract does not directly mention mutations in RGS2, it does provide evidence that changes in RGS2 expression are associated with schizophrenia. Thus, it supports the broader statement regarding RGS2's association with schizophrenia, implying that genetic variations influencing expression (like mutations) could be relevant. However, more specific studies would be required to directly link mutations in RGS2 to schizophrenia."	Regulator of G-protein signalling (RGS) proteins inhibit signalling by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs mediate the functions of several important neurotransmitters and serve as targets of many anti-psychotics. RGS2, RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16 are located on chromosome 1q23.3-31, a locus found to be associated with schizophrenia. Although previous gene expression analysis detected down-regulation of RGS4 expression in brain samples of patients with schizophrenia, the results were not consistent. In the present study, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of differential RGS2, RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16 expression in Brodmann Area 10 (BA10) samples of patients with schizophrenia and from healthy controls. Two microarray datasets met the inclusion criteria (overall, 41 schizophrenia samples and 38 controls were analysed). RGS2 and RGS16 were found to be up-regulated in BA10 samples of individuals with schizophrenia, whereas no differential expression of RGS4 and RGS5 was detected. Analysis of dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex samples of the CommonMind Consortium (258 schizophrenia samples vs. 279 controls) further validated the results. Given their central role in inactivating G-protein-coupled signalling pathways, our results suggest that differential gene expression might lead to enhanced inactivation of G-protein signalling in schizophrenia. This, in turn, suggests that additional studies are needed to further explore the consequences of the differential expression we detected, this time at the protein and functional levels.
84	34613934	High expression of SERP1 is associated with melanoma	SERP1	Melanoma	0	"The biomedical abstract you provided actually does not support the statement that high expression of SERP1 is associated with melanoma. Instead, it presents the opposite finding. Here's why the abstract does not support the statement:

1. **Expression Levels and Prognosis**: The study explicitly states that patients with skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) had low SERP1 expression. It further elaborates that this low expression is associated with worse prognosis, including lower overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progress-free interval (PFI) rates.

2. **Functional Analysis**: The study performed functional, pathway, and gene enrichment analyses to investigate the role of SERP1 in melanoma, which consistently pointed towards an association of low SERP1 expression with poor outcomes.

3. **Independence as a Prognostic Factor**: Cox regression analysis and the development of nomograms identified low SERP1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes in patients with SKCM, emphasizing the significance of its expression level in the disease's progression and prognosis.

4. **Immune Infiltration Correlations**: The study finds significant correlations between low SERP1 expression and the level of immune cell infiltration in SKCM, suggesting that SERP1 expression might influence the immune response in melanoma, potentially affecting the tumor microenvironment and patient outcomes.

Overall, the abstract provides clear evidence that low, rather than high, SERP1 expression is significantly associated with skin cutaneous melanoma and relates to worse outcomes in patients, contradicting the statement that high expression of SERP1 is associated with melanoma."	Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) is a gene induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a major contributor to multiple tumor types. Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive and fatal cancer with poor treatment outcomes after progression. In this study, we evaluated SERP1's role in tumorigenesis, prognosis, and immune infiltration in SKCM. Patients with SKCM had low SERP1 expression. We identified differentially expressed genes between high- and low-SERP1 expression groups and conducted functional, pathway, and gene enrichment analyses. Protein-protein (PPI) and gene-gene interaction (GGI) networks were constructed via STRING and GeneMANIA, respectively. SERP1 mutation information was obtained through cBioPortal; location in the skin was identified through the Human Protein Atlas. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an association between low SERP1 expression and overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progress-free interval (PFI) rates, and worse prognosis in patients with multiple clinicopathological features. Cox regression analysis and nomograms further presented SERP1 level as an independent prognostic factor for patients with SKCM. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between SERP1 expression and immune infiltrates; thus, low SERP1 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and can be considered a poor prognostic biomarker in patients with SKCM.

85	36617784	TAC1 has no association with Alzheimers disease	TAC1	Alzheimers	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that ""TAC1 has no association with Alzheimer's disease."" Instead, it provides evidence suggesting a potential association. Here's why:

1. **Identification as a Hub Gene**: The abstract mentions that TAC1 was identified as a hub gene in the analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) in Alzheimer's disease patients' frontal cortex samples. Hub genes are typically central in gene regulatory networks and can play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of diseases.

2. **Involvement in Synaptic Function and Inflammation**: The study highlighted that TAC1 may be related to important biological processes such as synaptic function and inflammation, both of which are significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Synaptic dysfunction is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease, and inflammation has been increasingly recognized as a contributor to the disease process.

3. **Downregulation in Disease Models**: The study further validated the expression levels of TAC1 in the cortex of 5xFAD mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease, where TAC1 was found to be downregulated. This change in expression in an AD model supports the gene’s potential involvement in the disease.

4. **Use of Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA)**: The RRA approach was used to identify DEGs across multiple studies, suggesting that the findings regarding TAC1 are likely to be robust and replicated across different datasets.

Therefore, based on the findings presented in the abstract, TAC1 appears to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, contrary to the statement that it has no association."	Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings heavy burden to society and family. There is an urgent need to find effective methods for disease diagnosis and treatment. The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach that could aggregate the resulting gene lists has been widely utilized in genomic data analysis. To identify hub genes using RRA approach in AD. Seven microarray datasets in frontal cortex from GEO database were used to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) in AD patients using RRA approach. STRING was performed to explore the protein-to-protein interaction (PPI). Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were utilized for enrichment analysis. Human Gene Connectome and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used for functional annotation. Finally, the expression levels of hub genes were validated in the cortex of 5xFAD mice by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After RRA analysis, 473 DEGs (216 upregulated and 257 downregulated) were identified in AD samples. PPI showed that DEGs had a total of 416 nodes and 2750 edges. These genes were divided into 17 clusters, each of which contains at least three genes. After functional annotation and enrichment analysis, TAC1 is identified as the hub gene and may be related to synaptic function and inflammation. In addition, Tac1 was found downregulated in cortices of 5xFAD mice. In the current study, TAC1 is identified as a key gene in the frontal cortex of AD, providing insight into the possible pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for this disease.
86	17376622	TAC! mutations correlate with autism	TAC1	Autism	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that ""TAC1 mutations correlate with autism."" Here's why:

1. **Study Outcome**: The study specifically investigated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Tachykinin 1 gene (TAC1) and autism. Despite TAC1 being located in a candidate region for autism and its products being involved in modulating glutamatergic synaptic transmission and inflammation (both relevant to autism pathology), the study found no significant difference in allele or haplotype frequencies between autistic patients and normal controls in the Japanese population.

2. **Lack of Genetic Association**: The results indicate that the TAC1 locus is not likely to play a major role in the development of autism, at least within the population studied. This finding directly contradicts the statement that TAC1 mutations correlate with autism, as no significant genetic correlation was identified.

3. **Population Specificity**: The study was conducted in a specific population (Japanese), and it is possible that findings could vary in different genetic backgrounds. However, based on the data presented in this abstract, there is no support for the assertion that mutations in TAC1 are associated with autism in this population.

Thus, the abstract clearly states that based on their findings, TAC1 does not appear to be a major factor in autism, directly opposing the idea that TAC1 mutations correlate with the condition."	Autism (MIM 209850) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disturbances in social interaction and communication, by repetitive body movements and restricted interests, and by atypical language development. Several twin and family studies have shown strong evidence for genetic factors in the etiology of autism. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. Glutamate systems are involved in the pathophysiology of autism. There are many similarities between the symptoms evoked by glutamate antagonist treatment and symptoms of autism found in several human and animal studies. To elucidate the genetic background of autism, we analyzed the relationship between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Tachykinin 1 gene (TAC1) and autism, because TAC1 is located in the candidate region for autism and produces substance P and neurokinins. These products modulate glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission and are also involved in inflammation. Many different inflammation-related mechanisms could be involved in the autistic brain. Therefore, TAC1 may have some functions associated with the presumable pathophysiology of autism. We compared the allele and haplotype frequencies between autistic patients (n=170) and normal controls (n=214) in the Japanese population, but no significant difference was observed. Thus, the TAC1 locus is not likely to play a major role in the development of autism.
87	15729363	A mutation in TAC1 correlates to multiple sclerosis	TAC1	Multiple sclerosis	1	"This biomedical abstract does support the statement that a mutation in TAC1 correlates to multiple sclerosis (MS). Here’s why:

1. **Genetic Association**: The study focuses on the potential relevance of chromosome 7q21-22, where the TAC1 gene is located, in the susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. It highlights significant associations found in genome-wide linkage screens and microsatellite studies in different cohorts, which suggest a genetic linkage between this region and MS.

2. **Specific Findings**: The researchers identified polymorphisms in the TAC1 gene and found a particular single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 1 of TAC1 that showed a significant association with MS. This direct evidence of a polymorphism in TAC1 correlating with MS supports the idea that mutations in this gene are associated with the disease.

3. **Haplotype Analysis**: The study also reports that two-marker haplotypes, which include SNPs from the TAC1 promoter and intron 1, were significantly associated with MS, particularly with the relapsing-remitting form of the disease. This adds another layer of genetic evidence linking TAC1 mutations to MS susceptibility.

4. **Biological Plausibility**: TAC1 encodes neuropeptides known as tachykinins, which have various biological functions that could logically be implicated in the pathophysiology of MS, although the exact mechanisms would need further exploration.

5. **Reproducibility and Further Research**: The abstract mentions the need for independent reproduction of these findings, which is a common step in genetic research to confirm the role of a gene in a disease. This cautious approach underscores the preliminary but promising nature of the findings.

In summary, the abstract provides evidence that mutations in the TAC1 gene, particularly certain SNPs, are associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis, thus supporting the statement that a mutation in TAC1 correlates to the disease."	The potential relevance of chromosome 7q21-22 in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) has been highlighted in genome-wide linkage screens as well as in association studies of 7q-specific polymorphic microsatellites. Especially, recent, independently performed studies have provided evidence for significant association of the markers D7S554 and D7S3126 with MS in Sardinian, Northern Irish and Spanish-American cohorts. The gene most closely located to these markers is the neuropeptide preprotachykinin-1 (TAC1) gene. Both its position and the array of biological functions exerted by its expression products make it a logical primary choice for further scrutiny as the putative chromosome 7q21-22 MS susceptibility gene. We report identification of eight polymorphisms in this gene by means of a sequencing approach. A Northern Irish case-control was typed for six of these polymorphisms. One of these, an intron 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), showed significant association with MS (P=0.009). Two-marker haplotypes composed of allelic combinations of TAC1 promoter-intron 1 SNPs were highly significantly associated with MS and more so with the relapsing-remitting form of this disease. While independent reproduction of these data in other data sets is indicated, our work is suggestive for a role of the TAC1 gene in MS.

88	38272954	A mutation in TAC1 correlates to Parkinson's Disease	TAC1	Parkinson's Disease	0	"This biomedical abstract does not explicitly support the statement that mutations in TAC1 correlate to Parkinson's Disease (PD), but it does present data that TAC1 could be a significant gene of interest in the context of PD diagnosis and pathogenesis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the abstract's support and limitations regarding the statement:

Supportive Aspects
1. **Identification as a Potential Diagnostic Biomarker**: The abstract identifies TAC1 among seven genes with potential as diagnostic biomarkers for PD based on Lasso Cox regression analysis. This suggests a role for TAC1 in PD, although it does not specify the nature of this role, whether as a result of mutations or general expression changes.

2. **Gene Expression Profiling**: TAC1 was found among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in substantia nigra (SN) tissues of PD patients, highlighting its relevance in the disease context.

3. **Validation and Sensitivity/Specificity**: The potential of TAC1 as a diagnostic biomarker was validated in peripheral blood samples and additional datasets, showing exceptional sensitivity and specificity. This supports its relevance in PD, potentially linked to changes in expression patterns rather than specific mutations.

Limitations
1. **Lack of Specific Mutation Analysis**: The study does not specifically mention mutations in TAC1; it discusses gene expression differences. Therefore, the statement about mutations in TAC1 correlating with PD isn't directly supported.

2. **Gene Function Unclear**: The functional role of TAC1 in PD pathogenesis or its impact on PD progression is not detailed. The study focuses more on the diagnostic potential of gene expression levels.

3. **Methodology Focused on Expression, Not Genetic Variation**: The methodologies used, such as RRA analysis and PPI networks, focus on expression levels and interactions rather than genetic mutations or variations directly linked to PD.

Conclusion
While the study highlights TAC1 as a significant gene in the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, it does not provide evidence that mutations in TAC1 are associated with PD. The abstract supports the relevance of TAC1 in PD but does so from the perspective of its expression and potential as a biomarker, not through specific genetic mutations influencing disease susceptibility or progression. More research would be needed to specifically link TAC1 mutations to PD pathogenesis."	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is attributed to development of Lewy bodies and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic indicators for PD. In this study, we aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for PD and analyzed the impact of immune cell infiltrations on disease pathogenesis. The PD expression profile data for human SN tissue, GSE7621, GSE20141, GSE20159, GSE20163 and GSE20164 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for use in the training model. After normalization and merging, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Robust rank aggregation (RRA) analysis. Simultaneously, DEGs after batch correction were identified. Gene interactions were determined through venn Diagram analysis. Functional analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to the identify hub genes, which were visualized through Cytoscape. A Lasso Cox regression model was employed to identify the potential diagnostic genes. The GSE20292 dataset was used for validation. The proportion of infiltrating immune cells in the samples were determined via the CIBERSORT method. Sixty-two DEGs were screened in this study. They were found to be enriched in nerve conduction, dopamine (DA) metabolism, and DA biosynthesis Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The PPI network and Lasso Cox regression analysis revealed seven potential diagnostic genes, namely SLC18A2, TAC1, PCDH8, KIAA0319, PDE6H, AXIN1, and AGTR1, were subsequently validated in peripheral blood samples obtained from healthy control (HC) and PD patients, as well as in the GSE20292 dataset. The results revealed the exceptional sensitivity and specificity of these genes in PD diagnosis and monitoring. Moreover, PD patients exhibited a higher number of plasma cells, compared to HC individuals. The SLC18A2, TAC1, PCDH8, KIAA0319, PDE6H, AXIN1, and AGTR1 are potential diagnostic biomarkers for PD. Our findings also reveal the essential roles of immune cell infiltration in both disease onset and trajectory.
89	17175032	A mutation in TAC1 is associated with multiple sclerosis in all populations	TAC1	Multiple sclerosis	0	"The biomedical abstract does not support the statement that mutations in TAC1 are associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) in all populations. Instead, it suggests a more nuanced view where potential associations may vary depending on the population studied, and further research is needed to clarify these associations. Here are key points from the abstract that relate to this conclusion:

Key Points:
1. **Initial Negative Results**: The study initially found no significant associations between single polymorphic markers or haplotypes in the TAC1 gene and MS susceptibility after correcting for multiple comparisons in the Northern Irish population.

2. **Inconsistent Findings in Sardinian Population**: The analysis of two specific SNPs in the TAC1 gene in a Sardinian cohort did not yield statistically significant results. However, a similar trend was observed compared to earlier findings in the Northern Irish population, suggesting some consistency but not conclusive evidence.

3. **Meta-Analysis Results**: The meta-analysis combining data from Sardinian and Northern Irish cohorts did show a significant association for two SNPs in TAC1 (rs2072100 and rs7793277) with a decreased risk of MS. However, the fact that individual analyses in Sardinian cohorts were not significant suggests that the genetic influence of TAC1 on MS may not be consistent across all populations.

4. **Further Research Advocated**: The abstract explicitly mentions the need for further exploration of the TAC1 gene region in MS, indicating that existing findings are preliminary and not sufficiently robust to conclude a universal genetic influence across different populations.

Conclusion:
The evidence presented in the abstract suggests that while there may be some association between TAC1 mutations and MS in certain contexts or populations (such as Northern Irish), these associations do not uniformly extend to all populations (as seen with the Sardinian cohort). Thus, the statement that TAC1 mutations are associated with MS in all populations is not supported. This underscores the complexity of genetic influences on diseases like MS and the importance of conducting large-scale, multi-population studies to uncover the true extent and nature of these genetic factors."	The related immunomodulatory neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP; gene symbol ADCYAP1) have recently been proposed as novel therapeutics for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). These neuropeptides, as well as those belonging to the tachykinin family exert pleiotropic effects, many of which are of relevance to central nervous system inflammation. In the present study, we have analysed 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 microsatellite markers in the VIP, ADCYAP1, TAC3 and TAC4 genes for susceptibility to MS in a case-control collection from Northern Ireland. Following correction for multiple comparisons, we did not find any significant associations between single polymorphic markers or multiple-marker haplotypes and susceptibility to MS. Furthermore, we analysed 2 SNPs in the TAC1 gene in a set of Sardinian trio MS families, based on our previous observation of association of these SNPs with MS in the Northern Irish (Genes Immun. 2005, 6, 265-270). Analysis of these SNPs in the Sardinians was not significant though a similar trend to that originally observed in the Northern Irish was present. Meta-analysis of the Sardinian and Northern Irish TAC1 SNP genotype data revealed a Mantel-Haenszel Common OR Estimate for the TAC1 intron 1 SNP rs2072100 of 0.76 (95% CI 0.63-0.92; P=0.005; A allele) and for the TAC1 promoter SNP rs7793277 of 0.76 (95% CI 0.615-0.95; P=0.014; C allele). Our data advocate a need for further exploration of the TAC1 gene region in MS.
90	36537591	UBA1 variations are associated with VEXAS syndrome	UBA1	VEXAS syndrome	1	"The biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that variations in the UBA1 gene are associated with VEXAS syndrome. Here are the key aspects of the abstract that support this connection:

1. **Definition and Cause**: The abstract begins by defining VEXAS syndrome as a late-onset, acquired autoinflammatory disorder directly caused by mutations in the UBA1 gene. This establishes a clear link between UBA1 gene mutations and the onset of VEXAS syndrome.

2. **Disease Description**: It describes VEXAS syndrome as a hematoinflammatory disorder, which is a new disease category characterized by somatic mutations that are restricted to blood cells but cause systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement. This description emphasizes the systemic impact of the UBA1 mutations.

3. **Genetic Focus**: The review focuses on the genetic causes and immunopathology of VEXAS syndrome, highlighting the central role of UBA1 mutations in the disease's pathogenesis and clinical presentation.

4. **Clinical Relevance**: The abstract mentions the significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy associated with VEXAS syndrome, underscoring the clinical importance of understanding and diagnosing the UBA1 mutations correctly.

5. **Research and Diagnostic Criteria**: It points out the need for consensus diagnostic criteria to define VEXAS and its related disorders, indicating ongoing research and the evolving understanding of how UBA1 variations manifest in the disease.

6. **Future Directions**: The mention of investigating VEXAS-like cases without UBA1 mutations suggests that while UBA1 is crucial, there might be other genetic factors involved, which requires further research. This highlights the complexity and variability of the genetic underpinnings in syndromes like VEXAS.

In conclusion, the abstract supports the statement that UBA1 variations are associated with VEXAS syndrome by describing the gene's central role in the disease's definition, its pathogenic mechanism, and the clinical impact of its mutations."	VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a recently described, late-onset, acquired autoinflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the <i>UBA1</i> gene. The various clinical manifestations of VEXAS broadly divided into inflammatory or haematological. VEXAS defines a new disease category - the hematoinflammatory disorders triggered by somatic mutations restricted to blood but causing systemic inflammation with multi-organ involvement and associated with aberrant bone marrow status. VEXAS causes significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, but the optimum standard of care remains undefined. This review describes the discovery of VEXAS, relevant genetic causes and immunopathology of the disease. A detailed account of its various clinical manifestations and disease mimics is provided. Current treatment and management options are discussed. New rare variants in <i>UBA1</i> and VEXAS-like <i>UBA1</i> negative cases are reported. Consensus diagnostic criteria might be required to define VEXAS and its related disorders. Investigation of sporadic, VEXAS-like cases will require the application of deep sequencing using DNA obtained from various cellular or tissue locations. Prospective studies are needed to define the optimal supportive and treatment options for patients with varying disease severity and prognosis. VEXAS-specific hematopoietic stem cell transplant selection criteria also require development.
91	26399695	VAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease	VAMP1	Alzheimers	1	"This biomedical abstract strongly supports the statement that VAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Here's a breakdown of how it supports this statement:

1. **Genetic Association**: The study identifies five polymorphisms in the VAMP1 gene, which encodes a member of the SNARE complex crucial for neuronal Aβ release, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. This establishes a direct genetic link to potential alterations in Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.

2. **Expression and Functional Impact**: It demonstrates that these polymorphisms can lead to bidirectional changes in VAMP1 expression in the cerebellum, impacting neuronal Aβ exocytosis. Specifically, knockdown experiments showing a significant reduction in Aβ exocytosis with altered VAMP1 expression underline the functional importance of these polymorphisms.

3. **Epidemiological Evidence**: A case-control association study involving a large sample (4,667 Alzheimer's disease patients and 6,175 controls) shows that polymorphisms associated with increased VAMP1 expression correlate with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, a polymorphism linked to decreased expression shows a modest protective effect.

4. **Statistical Significance**: The associations between VAMP1 expression levels and Alzheimer's disease risk are statistically significant, providing strong epidemiological evidence that VAMP1 polymorphisms contribute to the disease's pathology.

5. **Mechanistic Insight**: The study connects the genetic variations in VAMP1 with functional outcomes (neuronal Aβ exocytosis) that are central to the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that VAMP1 could influence disease onset and progression through its role in Aβ dynamics.

In conclusion, the abstract supports the statement by providing both genetic and functional evidence that VAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, offering insights into the molecular mechanisms that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention."	Following publication of this work, we noticed that we inadvertently failed to include Dr Ferenc Deák in the author list. The author list has now been corrected and the amended authors' contributions section has been modified accordingly below.
92	33883344	Variations in VAMP1 are associated with lymphoma	VAMP1	Lymphoma	0	"The biomedical abstract provided does not directly support the statement that variations in VAMP1 are associated with lymphoma. The abstract primarily discusses the comprehensive expression of conjoined genes (CGs) in a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) cell line and further analyses across other cell lines and samples. Although it mentions VAMP1 as part of a conjoined gene (VAMP1-CD27-AS1) detected in the B-NHL cell line, the abstract does not provide specific evidence linking VAMP1 variations directly to lymphoma in terms of causality or association with the disease pathogenesis.

Key points from the abstract include:
1. **Identification of Conjoined Genes:** The study identifies several CGs in a lymphoma cell line, including VAMP1-CD27-AS1. However, this alone does not imply that variations in VAMP1 are responsible for or correlated with lymphoma. It merely states that this conjoined gene expression was observed.

2. **Lack of Functional Evidence:** There is no discussion of the functional impact of VAMP1 or its role in lymphoma, such as how it might influence lymphoma development or progression.

3. **Broad Focus:** The study's broader focus on various CGs, including some not previously reported, suggests exploratory research rather than definitive conclusions about any specific gene's role in lymphoma.

4. **No Specific Association with Lymphoma:** While the presence of VAMP1-CD27-AS1 in a B-NHL sample is noted, there is no analysis or data suggesting that variations in VAMP1, as an individual gene, have a direct correlation with lymphoma incidence, severity, prognosis, or therapeutic response.

Thus, while the abstract contributes to the general understanding of gene expression in lymphoma, it does not provide evidence to support the statement that mutations or variations in VAMP1 are associated with lymphoma. More targeted research would be required to explore and establish any potential links between VAMP1 and lymphoma."	For this study, we investigated comprehensive expression of conjoined genes (CGs) in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) cell line KPUM-UH1 by using paired-end RNA sequencing. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of these transcripts in an additional 21 cell lines, 37 primary samples of various malignancies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four normal individuals. Seventeen CGs were detected in KPUM-UH1: CTBS-GNG5, SRP9-EPHX1, RMND5A-ANAPC, OTX1-EHBP1, ATF2-CHN1, PRKAA1-TTC33, LARP1-MRPL22, LOC105379697-BAK1, TIAM2-SCAF8, SPAG1-VPS13B, WBP1L-CNNM2, NARS2-GAB2, CTSC-RAB38, VAMP1-CD27-AS1, LRRC37A2-NSF, UBA2-WTIP and ZNF600-ZNF611. To our knowledge, 10 of these genes have not been previously reported. The various characteristics of the CGs included in- and out-of-frame fusions, chimeras involving non-coding RNA and transcript variants. A finding of note was that LARP1-MRPL2 was characterized as in-frame fusion and was recurrently expressed in B-NHL samples. In this study, variety of CGs was expressed both in malignant and normal cells, some of which might be specific to lymphoma.
93	38307580	Irregular expression of WARS1 is associated with gastric cancer	WARS1	gastric cancer	1	"The biomedical abstract provided supports the statement that irregular expression of WARS1 is associated with gastric cancer. Here are key points from the abstract that substantiate this claim:

1. **Clinical Significance of WARS1 in Gastric Cancer:** The study focuses on the expression of WARS1 in gastric cancer tissues and its potential role as a biomarker. WARS1 is highlighted as a gene involved in critical biological processes, such as amino acidification of tryptophan-tRNA, which are known to be implicated in cancer cell growth, metastasis, and drug resistance.

2. **Comparison Between WARS1 Expression Levels:** The study compares WARS1 expression in gastric cancer tissues to adjacent normal gastric mucosa, indicating a specific investigation into its differential expression and association with the disease.

3. **Association with Poor Prognostic Features:** Lower expression levels of WARS1 are significantly associated with more aggressive cancer features, including higher serosal invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and higher pathological stages. This suggests that WARS1 might play a role in tumor progression and aggressiveness.

4. **Impact on Survival:** The abstract reports a significant correlation between WARS1 expression levels and overall survival, with low WARS1 expression linked to worse survival outcomes. This finding emphasizes the potential of WARS1 as a prognostic indicator in gastric cancer.

5. **Independent Predictor of Survival:** Multivariate analysis in the study identifies low WARS1 expression as an independent predictor of poor overall survival, reinforcing its relevance in the prognosis of gastric cancer.

In summary, the abstract supports the statement that irregular expression of WARS1 (specifically, lower levels of expression) is associated with gastric cancer, contributing to a poorer prognosis and more aggressive disease characteristics. The findings suggest that WARS1 could be valuable both as a biomarker and a potential target for therapeutic interventions in gastric cancer."	The tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 gene (WARS1), encodes a tryptophan-tRNA synthetase involved in the amino acidification of tryptophan-tRNA and has been reported to be involved in cancer cell growth, metastasis promotion, and drug resistance in a variety of cancers. This study investigated the clinical significance of WARS1 expression as a biomarker in gastric cancer tissues obtained from patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (GC) who underwent radical resection. WARS1 expression in GC tissues and adjacent normal gastric mucosa of 253 patients with pStage II/III GC who underwent curative resection was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Association of WARS1 expression levels, categorized into high and low expression based on the median expression levels, with clinicopathological factors and overall survival (OS) of these patients was assessed. The low-WARS1 expression group had significantly higher serosal invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and pathological stage than did the high-WARS1 expression group. OS was significantly worse in the low- than in the high-WARS1 expression group (5-year survival 52.2% vs. 75.9%; p=0.0001). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, low WARS1 expression was an independent predictor for poor OS (hazard ratio=2.101; 95% confidence interval=1.328-3.322; p=0.002). In patients with locally advanced GC, after curative resection, WARS1 expression in GC tissue may be a useful prognostic marker.
94	37129951	A mutation in ACAA1 correlates with breast cancer	ACAA1	breast cancer	0	"The biomedical abstract provided does not explicitly support the statement that a mutation in ACAA1 correlates with breast cancer. Instead, the abstract focuses on the following aspects related to ACAA1:

1. **Expression Levels of ACAA1 in TNBC:** The study highlights that acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1) is highly expressed in the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared to adjacent normal tissues. This indicates an association between high expression of ACAA1 and this particular subtype of TNBC, rather than a correlation with mutations in the ACAA1 gene.

2. **Functional Role in Cancer Progression:** It details how inhibition of ACAA1 restrained TNBC cell proliferation and enhanced the effectiveness of a specific cancer drug (abemaciclib). The mechanism involves the interaction of ACAA1 with CDK4, affecting the phosphorylation of RB1 and inducing G1-S cell-cycle arrest.

3. **Therapeutic Implications:** The abstract discusses the potential of targeting ACAA1 for therapeutic benefits in TNBC, particularly when combined with other treatments like the drug trimetazidine.

The key point here is the focus on the expression and inhibition of ACAA1, rather than genetic mutations of the ACAA1 gene itself, in relation to breast cancer. While the high expression and impact on TNBC suggest ACAA1's involvement in the disease, this does not directly translate to mutations in the gene being correlated with breast cancer. The abstract does not provide evidence of specific mutations in ACAA1 leading to or associated with the development or progression of breast cancer. Thus, it does not support the statement regarding mutations in ACAA1 correlating with breast cancer."	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with unfavorable outcomes. Developing therapeutic targets for TNBC remains a challenge. Here, we identified that acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1) is highly expressed in the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype of TNBC compared with adjacent normal tissues in our TNBC proteomics dataset. Inhibition of ACAA1 restrained TNBC proliferation and potentiated the response to the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor abemaciclib. Mechanistically, ACAA1 interacted with CDK4, and the inhibition of ACAA1 blocked RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) phosphorylation, resulting in G1-S cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, trimetazidine, a traditional drug for ischemic heart disease, caused a decrease in ACAA1 protein levels and enhanced the efficacy of abemaciclib in preclinical TNBC models. In conclusion, this study identifies that ACAA1 is a therapeutic target in TNBC and suggests the combination of trimetazidine and abemaciclib could be beneficial for ACAA1-high TNBCs. ACAA1 is highly expressed in TNBC, serving as a potential therapeutic target in ACAA1-high tumors and a predictive biomarker of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors for RB1-proficient patients.
95	26237329	Irregular expression of ACOXL is associated with prostate cancer	ACOXL	prostate cancer	1	"The biomedical abstract provided supports the statement that irregular expression of ACOXL (acyl-CoA oxidase-like) is associated with prostate cancer. Here’s how the abstract backs this claim:

1. **Identification of Prostate-Specific Proteins:** The study aimed to define the prostate-specific transcriptome and proteome by comparing prostate tissue to 26 other human tissues. This comprehensive analysis helps identify unique expression patterns that are specific to the prostate, which is crucial for understanding prostate function and disease.

2. **Elevated Expression in Prostate:** The abstract mentions the identification of 203 genes that show elevated expression in the prostate, of which 22 have significantly higher expression levels compared to other tissues. This indicates a strong tissue-specific expression which could be critical in normal prostate function or pathology.

3. **Potential Diagnostic Markers for Prostate Cancer:** Among the identified proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL are noted as poorly characterized but with potential utility in differentiating between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. The mention of ACOXL in this context implies that its expression levels might be distinctly altered in prostate cancer tissues compared to benign tissues.

4. **Use in Clinical Diagnostics:** The potential to use ACOXL as a marker to differentiate benign from cancerous tissues suggests that irregular expression levels (either upregulation or downregulation) could be associated with tumor presence or progression in the prostate gland.

In summary, while the abstract does not delve into specifics about the nature of the expression changes (e.g., whether ACOXL is upregulated or downregulated in cancerous tissues), it clearly links the protein's expression with the ability to distinguish between benign and malignant prostate conditions. Therefore, it supports the idea that irregular expression of ACOXL is associated with prostate cancer."	To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.
96	38007539	Reduced ACO2 expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease	ACO2	Parkinson's Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract provided supports the statement that reduced ACO2 (aconitase 2) expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Here are the key points from the abstract that align with this statement:

1. **Observation of Reduced ACO2 Activity in PD Patients:** The study notes that peripheral ACO2 activity was significantly decreased in PD patients and correlates this reduction with the age of onset and duration of the disease. This direct measurement in patients provides strong evidence for a link between reduced ACO2 activity and PD.

2. **Impact of ACO2 Reduction in Animal Models:** The use of knock-in mouse and Drosophila models harboring the A252T variant of ACO2 showed aggravated motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron degeneration upon induction with Parkinsonian toxins (6-OHDA and rotenone). This suggests that the reduction in ACO2 worsens PD-like symptoms in models, further supporting its relevance to the disease.

3. **Cellular Dysfunction from ACO2 Reduction:** The abstract details that cells with knocked down or blocked ACO2 exhibited mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction. This includes significant downregulation of autophagy-related genes such as LC3 and Atg5, which are crucial for neuronal health and function.

4. **Therapeutic Potential:** The study suggests that targeting ACO2 to improve energy metabolism could be a potential therapeutic strategy for PD, indicating the critical role of this enzyme in the disease’s pathology.

5. **ACO2 as a Biomarker:** The abstract proposes ACO2 as a potential early biomarker for PD, which could be used in clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of antioxidants. This proposal stems from its documented association with disease characteristics and response to stressors in experimental models.

Overall, the abstract strongly supports the hypothesis that reduced expression or activity of ACO2 is associated with Parkinson's Disease through multiple lines of evidence, including patient data, animal model studies, and cellular function assays. This points to ACO2 not only as a marker of disease but potentially as a target for therapeutic intervention."	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by α-synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which are sensitive to oxidative stress. Mitochondria aconitase 2 (ACO2) is an essential enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle that orchestrates mitochondrial and autophagic functions to energy metabolism. Though widely linked to diseases, its relation to PD has not been fully clarified. Here we revealed that the peripheral ACO2 activity was significantly decreased in PD patients and associated with their onset age and disease durations. The knock-in mouse and Drosophila models with the A252T variant displayed aggravated motor deficits and DA neuron degeneration after 6-OHDA and rotenone-induction, and the ACO2 knockdown or blockade cells showed features of mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction. Moreover, the transcription of autophagy-related genes LC3 and Atg5 was significantly downregulated via inhibited histone acetylation at the H3K9 and H4K5 sites. These data provided multi-dimensional evidences supporting the essential roles of ACO2, and as a potential early biomarker to be used in clinical trials for assessing the effects of antioxidants in PD. Moreover, ameliorating energy metabolism by targeting ACO2 could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
97	38310198	ACP2 expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease	ACP2	Parkinson's Disease	1	"The biomedical abstract provided supports the statement that ACP2 (acid phosphatase 2, lysosomal) expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Here's how the abstract aligns with this statement:

1. **Association with PD**: The study identified ACP2 as one of two critical feature genes through machine learning analysis of RNA-seq data from the substantia nigra of PD patients compared to normal subjects. This suggests a specific role for ACP2 in PD pathogenesis.

2. **Disease Severity Correlation**: ACP2 was found in a molecular classification cluster that had a higher disease severity, implying that its expression levels or patterns might correlate with more severe forms of PD.

3. **Model Validation and Immune Infiltration**: The PD risk prediction model constructed using ACP2 showed robust confidence in predicting PD risk, validated through both machine learning methodologies and biological function analysis in a PD rat model. Additionally, significant immune infiltration correlations with ACP2 underscore its role in neuroinflammatory processes often observed in PD.

4. **Broader Biological Implications**: Beyond PD, ACP2 was analyzed for its roles in various cancers, indicating its involvement in broad biological processes and disease mechanisms, which could include those shared with PD such as cellular stress responses and immune system interactions.

5. **Therapeutic Potential**: The abstract suggests that ACP2 could be a potential therapeutic target in PD, given its association with disease severity and progression, as well as its role in immune-related pathways.

Overall, the abstract supports the claim that ACP2 expression is associated with Parkinson's Disease by detailing its significant role in disease-specific expression patterns, correlations with disease severity, involvement in immune processes, and potential as a therapeutic target. This broadens the understanding of lysosomal function in neurodegenerative diseases and positions ACP2 as a notable gene of interest in both research and clinical contexts for PD."	The pivotal role of lysosomal function in preserving neuronal homeostasis is recognized, with its dysfunction being implicated in neurodegenerative processes, notably in Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, the molecular underpinnings of lysosome-related genes (LRGs) in the context of PD remain partially elucidated. We collected RNA-seq data from the brain substantia nigra of 30 PD patients and 20 normal subjects from the GEO database. We obtained molecular classification clusters from the screened lysosomal expression patterns. The lysosome-related diagnostic model of Parkinson's disease was constructed by XGBoost and Random Forest. And we validated the expression patterns of signature LRGs in the diagnostic model by constructing a PD rat model. Finally, the linkage between PD and cancer through signature genes was explored. The expression patterns of the 33 LRGs screened can be divided into two groups of PD samples, enabling exploration of the variance in biological processes and immune elements. Cluster A had a higher disease severity. Subsequently, critical genes were sieved through the application of machine learning methodologies culminating in the identification of two intersecting feature genes (ACP2 and LRP2). A PD risk prediction model was constructed grounded on these signature genes. The model's validity was assessed through nomogram evaluation, which demonstrated robust confidence validity. Then we analyzed the correlation analysis, immune in-filtration, biological function, and rat expression validation of the two genes with common pathogenic genes in Parkinson's disease, indicating that these two genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. We then selected ACP2, which had a significant immune infiltration correlation, as the entry gene for the pan-cancer analysis. The pan-cancer analysis revealed that ACP2 has profound associations with prognostic indicators, immune infiltration, and tumor-related regulatory processes across various neoplasms, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in a range of human diseases, including PD and cancers. Our study comprehensively analyzed the molecular grouping of LRGs expression patterns in Parkinson's disease, and the disease progression was more severe in cluster A. And the PD diagnosis model related to LRGs is constructed. Finally, ACP2 is a potential target for the relationship between Parkinson's disease and tumor.
98	20093102	Pyridostigmine is an effective drug against Polio	Pyridostigmine	Polio	0	"The biomedical abstract does not directly support the statement that pyridostigmine is an effective drug against polio itself; rather, it discusses the potential utility of pyridostigmine in managing symptoms associated with post-polio syndrome (PPS), which is a condition that can develop years after an initial polio infection. Here's how the abstract relates to the use of pyridostigmine in PPS rather than in the treatment of polio:

1. **Target Condition**: The focus of the abstract is on post-polio syndrome, not acute polio infection. Pyridostigmine and other therapies mentioned are evaluated for their effectiveness in alleviating the long-term sequelae experienced by polio survivors, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and pain.

2. **Therapeutic Evaluation**: The abstract notes that various medications including pyridostigmine have been tested for their potential benefits in PPS. However, it does not claim conclusive or robust effectiveness; instead, it mentions that ""very few studies reported some improvements."" This indicates a tentative or exploratory assessment of pyridostigmine's benefits in this context.

3. **Treatment Modality**: The mention of combining medications with physical exercise protocols suggests a multi-modal approach to managing PPS, highlighting that no single treatment may be wholly effective on its own.

4. **Research Status**: The abstract suggests that while some therapeutic strategies, including the use of pyridostigmine, show promise, more research is needed to firmly establish their efficacy in the care management of PPS.

In summary, while the abstract discusses pyridostigmine in the context of PPS treatment, it does not support the drug's efficacy against polio directly but rather indicates its potential role in symptom management in individuals already affected by polio's long-term effects."	Post-polio syndrome (PPS) refers to a clinical disorder affecting polio survivors with sequelae years after the initial polio attack. These patients report new musculoskeletal symptoms, loss of muscular strength or endurance. PPS patients are tired, in pain and experience new and unusual muscular deficits, on healthy muscles as well as deficient muscles initially affected by the Poliovirus. Once a clinical diagnosis is established, the therapeutic options can be discussed. Some pathophysiological mechanisms have been validated by research studies on PPS (inflammatory process in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and cytokines of the immune system). Several studies have been conducted to validate medications (pyridostigmine, immunoglobulin, coenzyme Q10) or physical exercises protocols. This article focuses on the relevance and efficacy that can be expected from these therapeutics. Very few studies reported some improvements. Medications combined to individual and supervised exercise training programs are promising therapeutic strategies for PPS patients care management.
99	31932370	Brincidofovir is an effective drug against Smallpox	Brincidofovir	Smallpox	1	"The biomedical abstract does support the statement that brincidofovir is an effective drug against smallpox, albeit indirectly. Here's how it supports the statement:

1. **Context of Smallpox as a Threat**: The abstract addresses the ongoing risk of smallpox (variola virus) reemergence, either through bioterrorism or synthetic biology, emphasizing the need for effective antiviral drugs.

2. **Recommendations and Regulatory Support**: It mentions that the WHO Advisory Committee on VARV Research recommends pursuing the development of new antiviral drugs against orthopoxviruses, which includes smallpox.

3. **FDA Approval**: Crucially, the abstract notes that in 2018, the U.S. FDA advised in favor of two molecules for the treatment of smallpox, one of which is brincidofovir. This recommendation by the FDA is a strong endorsement of brincidofovir's potential efficacy and utility in treating smallpox, even though it doesn't directly report clinical trial results or specific effectiveness data.

4. **Drug Development Challenges**: The abstract also highlights the difficulties of developing drugs for an eradicated disease, referencing the FDA's ""animal efficacy rule"" which allows for drug approval based on animal studies when human trials are unethical or infeasible, such as in the case of smallpox.

Overall, the abstract provides a regulatory and advisory perspective that supports the use of brincidofovir as an effective antiviral against smallpox, underscoring its acceptance and recommendation by significant health authorities like the WHO and FDA."	"Forty years after the last endemic smallpox case, variola virus (VARV) is still considered a major threat to humans due to its possible use as a bioterrorism agent. For many years, the risk of disease reemergence was thought to solely be through deliberate misuse of VARV strains kept in clandestine laboratories. However, recent experiments using synthetic biology have proven the feasibility of recreating a poxvirus <i>de novo</i>, implying that VARV could, in theory, be resurrected. Because of this new perspective, the WHO Advisory Committee on VARV Research released new recommendations concerning research on poxviruses that strongly encourages pursuing the development of new antiviral drugs against orthopoxviruses. In 2018, the U.S. FDA advised in favor of two molecules for smallpox treatment, tecovirimat and brincidofovir. This review highlights the difficulties to develop new drugs targeting an eradicated disease, especially as it requires working under the FDA ""animal efficacy rule"" with the few, and imperfect, animal models available."
