26242379	Idelalisib is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor, which is a first-in-class agent to be approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, likely because of solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluations, with dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily being allowed for specific toxicities. Idelalisib may be administered without regard to food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant food effects, and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79 % increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Administration with the potent inducer rifampin resulted in a 75 % decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and, as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice-daily dosing increases the midazolam AUC 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no meaningful impact on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was noted for any of the covariates tested. Idelalisib exposure was ~60 % higher with moderate/severe hepatic impairment; no relevant changes were observed with severe renal impairment. This article reviews a comprehensive pharmacology programme, including drug-drug interaction studies and mechanistic and special population studies, which has allowed a thorough understanding of idelalisib clinical pharmacokinetics and their impact on clinical safety and efficacy.	Breast Cancer		Idelalisib	Understanding the potential application of Idelalisib in breast cancer would require data or studies that specifically address its impact on the pathogenic mechanisms or therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer models or patients. Without such information, one cannot conclusively evaluate its usefulness against breast cancer based on the provided text alone. The text is valuable for understanding Idelalisib's general pharmacological profile but not sufficient to assess its potential benefits in breast cancer therapy.	0
27987518	Episcleritis and scleritis are relatively rare ocular diseases, which are commonly associated with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate clinical and laboratory features of SLE-associated episcleritis and scleritis, we now report 4 cases of inpatients who were diagnosed with episcleritis or scleritis secondary to SLE from September 2005 to July 2016 in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology in Peking University People's Hospital. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarized together with the treatment regimen and the prognosis; the literature was reviewed. There were 3 female and 1 male patients. The average age was (49.0±23.8) years and the mean duration of SLE at the onset of episcleritis or scleritis was (2.1±1.4) years. In addition to the eye involvement, the patients had mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis, lupus nephritis and interstitial pneumonia simultaneously; in the past, 1 patient experienced arthritis, 2 presented Raynaud's phenomenon, and 2 had hematologic involvement. All the patients had antinuclear antibody (ANA) of high titer. The anti double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibody titers were increased in 2 patients. Three patients had positive anti-nucleosome antibody (ANuA) while the other 1 patient did not test it. The complement levels were decreased in 3 patients. The systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores were more than 4 points in all the patients (ranging from 7-16), suggesting active disease. Ocular symptoms included pain, redness of the eye and tears. Ophthalmic examinations revealed 3 cases of episcleritis and 1 case of scleritis. Among the 4 patients, 2 patients experienced ocular complications including decrease in vision and uveitis. All the patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with hydroxycloroquine; 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide in 2 patients and leflunomide in 1 patient). All of the 4 patients received topical steroid and 1 patient received periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide; 1 patient received topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).No recurrence of episcleritis or scleritis was observed during the follow-ups. As a conclusion, scleritis and episcleritis, although uncommon, may occur in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including SLE. The occurrence of episcleritis and scleritis may suggest active disease of SLE. Ocular complications need to be aware of in the patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment was associated with good visual outcomes in the follow-ups.	Raynaud’s Disease		LEFLUNOMIDE	While leflunomide is mentioned as part of the treatment regimen for one of the patients, the text does not delve into its effectiveness or mechanism of action specifically in the context of treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is noted as a condition experienced by some of the patients in the past, but there is no detailed analysis or discussion on whether leflunomide—or any other treatment mentioned—was directly aimed at alleviating or targeting the key pathogenic mechanisms of Raynaud's.    To evaluate whether leflunomide could be effective for Raynaud's, one would look for specific discussions on its impact on vascular function, endothelial health, or other relevant pathophysiological aspects of Raynaud's. Such details would provide insight into whether leflunomide could offer therapeutic benefits or slow disease progression for Raynaud's patients.    In conclusion, while the text is informative regarding the treatment of ocular manifestations in SLE patients and mentions leflunomide as part of a treatment regimen, it does not offer sufficient evidence or discussion to evaluate leflunomide's efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon. Further research or texts focusing specifically on Raynaud's and the use of leflunomide in that context would be necessary for such an evaluation.	0
21701167	Prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (PO-3A) have been tested for outcome benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias and heart failure. Some evidence suggests that PO-3A may exert their benefit via inhibiting platelets. We tested the hypothesis that PO-3A may inhibit platelet activity in patients with documented stable CAD, beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. Thirty patients with documented CAD and triglycerides over 250 mg/dl treated with aspirin (70-160 mg/daily) and statins (simvastatin equivalence dose: 5-40 mg/daily) were randomized 1:1:1 to Omacor™ 1 g/day (DHA/EPA ratio 1.25:1.0), Omacor 2 g/day, or a placebo for 2 weeks. Platelet tests including aggregometry and flow cytometry and cartridge analyzer readings were performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks following PO-3A therapy. ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p = 0.037), GP IIb/IIIa antigen (p = 0.031) and activity (p = 0.024), and P-selectin (p = 0.041) were significantly reduced after PO-3A, while platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p = 0.09), vitronectin receptor (p = 0.16), formation of platelet-monocyte microparticles (p = 0.19) and the VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (p = 0.27) only exhibited nonsignificant trends suggestive of reduced platelet activity. Finally, collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, closure time with the PFA-100 device and expression of thrombospondin (CD36), GP Ib (CD42b), LAMP-3 (CD63), LAMP-1 (CD107a), CD40-ligand (CD154), GP37 (CD165), and PAR-1 receptor intact (SPAN 12) and cleaved (WEDE-15) epitopes were not affected by 2 weeks of PO-3A. Independently of the dose and already at 1 week, short-term therapy with PO-3A provided a modest reduction of platelet activity biomarkers, despite concomitant aspirin and statin therapy, when compared to a placebo. The effect of PO-3A is unique, differs from other known antiplatelet agents and suggests potential pleiotropism. These preliminary randomized data call for confirmation in prospective studies.	Heart Disease		OMEGA-3-ACID ETHYL ESTERS	The results indicate that short-term therapy with PO-3A leads to a modest reduction in certain markers of platelet activity, suggesting that these omega-3-acid ethyl esters have a unique effect on platelet function beyond the antiplatelet properties of aspirin and statins. The significant reductions observed in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, GP IIb/IIIa antigen and activity, and P-selectin after PO-3A therapy, compared to a placebo, highlight a potential mechanism through which PO-3A could offer benefits in the context of heart disease.    Platelets play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which are central to the development and progression of CAD. By reducing platelet activation and aggregation, PO-3A might help to lower the risk of thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction, thereby potentially slowing the progression of heart disease.    The text mentions that the effects observed call for confirmation in prospective studies, indicating that while the findings are promising, further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential and implications of PO-3A in heart disease. Nonetheless, this study contributes valuable evidence to the discussion on the benefits of omega-3-acid ethyl esters in heart disease, especially regarding their unique antiplatelet properties and potential role in therapeutic strategies beyond conventional treatments.	1
12676734	This review outlines recent advances related to the molecular mechanisms and pathways of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel trafficking. AQP2 is a fascinating protein, whose sorting signals can be interpreted by different cell types to achieve apical or basolateral membrane insertion, in both regulated and constitutive trafficking pathways. In addition to the well-known cAMP-mediated, stimulatory effect of vasopressin on AQP2 membrane insertion, other signaling and trafficking events can also lead to AQP2 membrane accumulation via cAMP-independent mechanisms. These include 1) elevation of cGMP, mediated by sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor), atrial natriuretic factor, and l-arginine (via nitric oxide synthase); 2) disruption of the actin cytoskeleton; and 3) inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic arm of the AQP2 recycling pathway by dominant-negative dynamin expression and by membrane cholesterol depletion. Recent data also indicate that AQP2 recycles constitutively in epithelial cells, it can be inserted into different membrane domains in different cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and these pathways can be modulated by factors including hypertonicity. The roles of accessory proteins, including small GTPases and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins in AQP2 membrane insertion, are also being uncovered. Understanding cAMP-independent mechanisms for membrane insertion of AQP2 is especially relevant to the therapeutic bypassing of the mutated, dysfunctional vasopressin receptor in patients with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.		AQP2	sodium	While sodium nitroprusside is mentioned, it serves as a nitric oxide donor rather than directly illustrating an interaction of sodium with AQP2 expression or trafficking. Therefore, the text does not provide evidence or discussion specifically related to sodium modulating AQP2 expression directly.    To evaluate the original question regarding sodium's interaction with AQP2 expression, one would look for research directly investigating the impact of sodium levels on AQP2 expression, trafficking, or function. This could include studies on how sodium concentration affects AQP2's cellular localization, stability, or activity, none of which are directly addressed in the given text.	0
29520964	The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30-40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.		DPP4	metformin	To evaluate whether there exists an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4, information is needed on pharmacogenetic studies, biochemical interactions, or clinical trials that specifically investigate how metformin might influence DPP4 gene expression or enzyme functionality. Such information would involve detailed discussions on the mechanisms of action of metformin that could potentially impact the DPP4 pathway.  In conclusion, while the text is useful for understanding the broader clinical implications of using various diabetes treatments in heart failure patients, it does not address the specific query about an interaction between metformin and the gene DPP4. For that, a different source or text focusing specifically on pharmacogenetic interactions or the molecular effects of metformin on DPP4 would be required.	0
38574433	Doxorubicin is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent for cancer, whose use is limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Semaglutide (SEMA), a novel analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has received widespread attention for the treatment of diabetes. However, increasing evidence has highlighted its potential therapeutic benefits on cardiac function. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of semaglutide in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is an established model to study cardiac function. Cardiac function was studied by transthoracic echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The results showed that semaglutide significantly ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. RNA sequencing suggested that Bnip3 is the candidate gene that impaired the protective effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. To determine the role of BNIP3 on the effect of semaglutide in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, BNIP3 with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter was injected into tail vein of C57/BL6J mice to overexpress BNIP3, specifically in the heart. Overexpression of BNIP3 prevented the improvement in cardiac function caused by semaglutide. In vitro experiments showed that semaglutide, via PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced BNIP3 expression in the mitochondria, improving mitochondrial function. Semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction via PI3K/AKT pathway, by reducing BNIP3 expression in mitochondria. The improvement in mitochondrial function reduces doxorubicin-mediated cardiac injury and improves cardiac function. Therefore, semaglutide is a potential therapy to reduce doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity.		BNIP3	Semaglutide	The text provided is indeed useful for evaluating the interaction between the drug semaglutide and the gene BNIP3. It describes a study focused on the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, in ameliorating cardiotoxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Key findings include:  Evidence of Interaction: RNA sequencing identified BNIP3 as a candidate gene that may impair the protective effect of semaglutide on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This suggests a genetic interaction where BNIP3 expression potentially modifies the effectiveness of semaglutide in this context.  Experimental Verification: Further experiments involving overexpression of BNIP3 in mice showed that increased levels of BNIP3 prevented semaglutide from improving cardiac function, which indicates that BNIP3 expression is inversely related to the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide.  Mechanistic Insights: The text also mentions that semaglutide, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduces BNIP3 expression in mitochondria, which in turn improves mitochondrial function. This reduction in BNIP3 expression is directly linked to semaglutide's ability to mitigate mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction.  Therapeutic Implications: The conclusion that semaglutide ameliorates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via a pathway that includes modulation of BNIP3 expression offers valuable insights into both the therapeutic mechanism of semaglutide and the role of BNIP3 in cardiac health.  Overall, the text clearly demonstrates that there is an interaction between semaglutide and the BNIP3 gene, with semaglutide modulating the expression of BNIP3 to exert its therapeutic effects. This interaction is relevant for understanding how semaglutide can be used to potentially mitigate cardiac injury in clinical settings involving doxorubicin treatment. The study details provided would be critical for any further research into the pharmacodynamics of semaglutide and its broader applications in cardiac therapeutics.	1
35455941	The <i>GBA</i> gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis. Approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene, making it numerically the most important genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Clinically, <i>GBA</i>-associated PD is identical to sporadic PD, aside from the earlier age at onset (AAO), more frequent cognitive impairment and more rapid progression. Mutations in <i>GBA</i> can be associated with loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. A key hallmark of PD is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies, which are made up primarily of alpha-synuclein. Mutations in the <i>GBA</i> gene may lead to loss of GCase activity and lysosomal dysfunction, which may impair alpha-synuclein metabolism. Models of GCase deficiency demonstrate dysfunction of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and subsequent accumulation of alpha-synuclein. This dysfunction can also lead to aberrant lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Certain mutations cause GCase to be misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating stress responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may contribute to neurodegeneration. In addition to these mechanisms, a GCase deficiency has also been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This review discusses the pathways associated with <i>GBA</i>-PD and highlights potential treatments which may act to target GCase and prevent neurodegeneration.	Parkinson’s Disease	GBA		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gene GBA. Here are several reasons supporting its usefulness:  Clear Connection Between GBA Mutations and PD: The text specifies that approximately 5-15% of PD patients have mutations in the GBA gene, establishing it as a significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. This direct association underlines the importance of the GBA gene in the context of PD.  Detailed Mechanistic Insights: The text describes how mutations in the GBA gene may lead to loss of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. This dysfunction is crucial as it impairs alpha-synuclein metabolism, a key process in the pathogenesis of PD. Alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of PD. This provides a mechanistic link between GBA mutations and the pathological features observed in PD.  Biological Consequences of GBA Mutations: The review further explains that GBA mutations can result in both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms. It details how these mutations can cause GCase to misfold and be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. This expands on the ways in which GBA mutations can influence cellular health and PD pathology.  Association with Clinical Features of PD: It is mentioned that GBA-associated PD is clinically similar to sporadic PD but with distinct features like an earlier age at onset, more rapid progression, and more frequent cognitive impairment. This differentiation is critical for understanding the clinical impact of GBA mutations in PD patients.  Therapeutic Implications: The text highlights potential treatments targeting GCase to prevent neurodegeneration, which not only underscores the interaction between GBA and PD but also suggests practical applications of this knowledge in developing therapeutic strategies.	1
37850885	Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder. Pathologically, it features abnormal epidermal proliferation, infiltrating inflammatory cells and increased angiogenesis in the dermis. Aberrant expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and a dysregulated protein ubiquitination system are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To examine the potential role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ligase and oncogene, in psoriasis. Gene expression and protein levels were evaluated with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of skin samples from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model, as well as from cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Protein interaction, substrate ubiquitination and degradation were examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and a cycloheximide chase assay in human umbilical vein ECs. Angiogenesis was measured in vitro using human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) for BrdU incorporation, migration and tube formation. In vivo angiogenesis assays included chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane, the Matrigel plug assay and quantification of vasculature in the mouse lesions. Skp2 gene global knockout (KO) mice and endothelial-specific conditional KO mice were used. Skp2 was increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis and IMQ-induced mouse lesions. Immunofluorescent double staining indicated a close association of Skp2 expression with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae. In HDMECs, Skp2 overexpression was enhanced, whereas Skp2 knockdown inhibited EC proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which suppresses the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was identified to be a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. A selective inhibitor of Skp2 (C1) or Skp2 small interfering RNA significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-triggered PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, Skp2-mediated ubiquitination depended on the phosphorylation of PTEN by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In the mouse model, Skp2 gene deficiency alleviated IMQ-induced psoriasis. Importantly, tamoxifen-induced endothelial-specific Skp2 KO mice developed significantly ameliorated psoriasis with diminished angiogenesis of papillae. Furthermore, topical use of the Skp2 inhibitor C1 effectively prevented the experimental psoriasis. The Skp2/PTEN axis may play an important role in psoriasis-associated angiogenesis. Thus, targeting Skp2-driven angiogenesis may be a potential approach to treating psoriasis.	Psoriasis	SKP2		The text provided is highly useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease psoriasis and the gene SKP2. Here's an argument supporting its usefulness:  Direct Investigation of Skp2 in Psoriasis: The study's objectives clearly focus on examining the role of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Skp2 is studied in both human and animal models, providing a comprehensive view of its function and effects in the context of this disease.  Increased Expression in Disease Context: The results show that Skp2 expression is increased in skin samples from patients with psoriasis as well as in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis. This upregulation in disease contexts suggests a potential pathogenic role of Skp2 in psoriasis.  Link to Psoriasis-Associated Angiogenesis: Skp2 is associated with excessive vascularity in the lesional dermal papillae, indicating a specific role in the angiogenic aspect of psoriasis pathology. The text details how Skp2 overexpression enhances endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, which are key components of angiogenesis.  Mechanistic Insights Involving Skp2 and PTEN: The study identifies PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel substrate for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction leads to the degradation of PTEN, further implicating Skp2 in the molecular pathways that exacerbate psoriasis, particularly through the modulation of angiogenic processes.  Therapeutic Implications and Genetic Confirmation: Use of Skp2 inhibitors and genetic knockout models (both global and endothelial-specific) demonstrate that reducing Skp2 activity or expression can significantly ameliorate psoriasis symptoms and reduce disease-associated angiogenesis. These findings not only support the role of Skp2 in psoriasis but also highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.  Broad Experimental Approaches: The combination of gene expression analysis, protein interaction studies, and functional assays in cell culture and in vivo, along with the use of both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models, provides a robust set of evidence linking Skp2 with psoriasis pathology.  In conclusion, the text is not only useful but also critical in providing detailed evidence of an interaction between psoriasis and the gene SKP2. It elucidates a specific biological pathway involving Skp2 that contributes to disease mechanisms, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The clear demonstration of increased Skp2 activity in psoriasis lesions and its role in promoting pathological angiogenesis via PTEN degradation underlines the importance of Skp2 as a molecular link in the progression of psoriasis.	1
38178103	Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear. Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia. There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors. Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.	Dementia	IVW		The piece of text provided is not useful for evaluating whether there exists an interaction between the disease dementia and the gene "IVW". Here are several points that clarify why the text does not serve this purpose:  Misinterpretation of "IVW": The text uses the term "IVW" in the context of statistical analysis, specifically referring to "Inverse Variance Weighting". IVW is a method used in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across multiple genetic instruments. It is not a gene, but rather a statistical technique.  Focus of the Study: The primary focus of the study is on the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia. The study aims to explore if cytokines mediate the relationship between gut microbiota and dementia, using genetic data from GWAS and MR.  No Mention of Gene IVW: There is no discussion or mention of a gene called "IVW" in the context of genetics or molecular biology within the text. Therefore, the text cannot be used to assess any interaction involving a gene named "IVW" and dementia because "IVW" in this context refers to a methodological approach, not a genetic entity.  Conclusion Misalignment: Since "IVW" refers to a method rather than a gene, the conclusions drawn from using this method (causal relationships between microbiota, cytokines, and dementia types) do not provide information about genetic interactions specific to a gene influencing dementia.  In summary, the text is useful for understanding the application of Mendelian randomization in exploring causal links between gut microbiota, cytokines, and dementia but it does not provide any insight into interactions between dementia and a gene called "IVW" simply because "IVW" is not a gene but a statistical method used in the analysis. Thus, the text cannot be used to evaluate genetic interactions involving a gene with that name in relation to dementia.	0
15201414	An open-label study indicated that selective depletion of B cells with the use of rituximab led to sustained clinical improvements for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To confirm these observations, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. We randomly assigned 161 patients who had active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate to receive one of four treatments: oral methotrexate (> or =10 mg per week) (control); rituximab (1000 mg on days 1 and 15); rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (750 mg on days 3 and 17); or rituximab plus methotrexate. Responses defined according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) were assessed at week 24 (primary analyses) and week 48 (exploratory analyses). At week 24, the proportion of patients with 50 percent improvement in disease symptoms according to the ACR criteria, the primary end point, was significantly greater with the rituximab-methotrexate combination (43 percent, P=0.005) and the rituximab-cyclophosphamide combination (41 percent, P=0.005) than with methotrexate alone (13 percent). In all groups treated with rituximab, a significantly higher proportion of patients had a 20 percent improvement in disease symptoms according to the ACR criteria (65 to 76 percent vs. 38 percent, P< or =0.025) or had EULAR responses (83 to 85 percent vs. 50 percent, P< or =0.004). All ACR responses were maintained at week 48 in the rituximab-methotrexate group. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first rituximab infusion: at 24 weeks, serious infections occurred in one patient (2.5 percent) in the control group and in four patients (3.3 percent) in the rituximab groups. Peripheral-blood immunoglobulin concentrations remained within normal ranges. In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment, a single course of two infusions of rituximab, alone or in combination with either cyclophosphamide or continued methotrexate, provided significant improvement in disease symptoms at both weeks 24 and 48.

20870100	Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by persistent synovitis, systemic inflammation, and autoantibodies (particularly to rheumatoid factor and citrullinated peptide). 50% of the risk for development of rheumatoid arthritis is attributable to genetic factors. Smoking is the main environmental risk. In industrialised countries, rheumatoid arthritis affects 0·5-1·0% of adults, with 5-50 per 100 000 new cases annually. The disorder is most typical in women and elderly people. Uncontrolled active rheumatoid arthritis causes joint damage, disability, decreased quality of life, and cardiovascular and other comorbidities. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the key therapeutic agents, reduce synovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function. The leading DMARD is methotrexate, which can be combined with other drugs of this type. Biological agents are used when arthritis is uncontrolled or toxic effects arise with DMARDs. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were the first biological agents, followed by abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab. Infections and high costs restrict prescription of biological agents. Long-term remission induced by intensive, short-term treatment selected by biomarker profiles is the ultimate goal.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Rituximab		1
28264816	Recent insights in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) necessitated updating the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) RA management recommendations. A large international Task Force based decisions on evidence from 3 systematic literature reviews, developing 4 overarching principles and 12 recommendations (vs 3 and 14, respectively, in 2013). The recommendations address conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GC); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, clazakizumab, sarilumab and sirukumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and the targets of sustained clinical remission (as defined by the American College of Rheumatology-(ACR)-EULAR Boolean or index criteria) or low disease activity are discussed. Cost aspects were taken into consideration. As first strategy, the Task Force recommends MTX (rapid escalation to 25 mg/week) plus short-term GC, aiming at >50% improvement within 3 and target attainment within 6 months. If this fails stratification is recommended. Without unfavourable prognostic markers, switching to-or adding-another csDMARDs (plus short-term GC) is suggested. In the presence of unfavourable prognostic markers (autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions, failure of 2 csDMARDs), any bDMARD (current practice) or Jak-inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD or tsDMARD is recommended. If a patient is in sustained remission, bDMARDs can be tapered. For each recommendation, levels of evidence and Task Force agreement are provided, both mostly very high. These recommendations intend informing rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies, hospital officials, social security agencies and regulators about EULAR's most recent consensus on the management of RA, aimed at attaining best outcomes with current therapies.

24161836	In this article, the 2010 European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs and bDMARDs, respectively) have been updated. The 2013 update has been developed by an international task force, which based its decisions mostly on evidence from three systematic literature reviews (one each on sDMARDs, including glucocorticoids, bDMARDs and safety aspects of DMARD therapy); treatment strategies were also covered by the searches. The evidence presented was discussed and summarised by the experts in the course of a consensus finding and voting process. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendations were derived and levels of agreement (strengths of recommendations) were determined. Fourteen recommendations were developed (instead of 15 in 2010). Some of the 2010 recommendations were deleted, and others were amended or split. The recommendations cover general aspects, such as attainment of remission or low disease activity using a treat-to-target approach, and the need for shared decision-making between rheumatologists and patients. The more specific items relate to starting DMARD therapy using a conventional sDMARD (csDMARD) strategy in combination with glucocorticoids, followed by the addition of a bDMARD or another csDMARD strategy (after stratification by presence or absence of adverse risk factors) if the treatment target is not reached within 6 months (or improvement not seen at 3 months). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, biosimilars), abatacept, tocilizumab and, under certain circumstances, rituximab are essentially considered to have similar efficacy and safety. If the first bDMARD strategy fails, any other bDMARD may be used. The recommendations also address tofacitinib as a targeted sDMARD (tsDMARD), which is recommended, where licensed, after use of at least one bDMARD. Biosimilars are also addressed. These recommendations are intended to inform rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies and other stakeholders about EULAR's most recent consensus on the management of RA with sDMARDs, glucocorticoids and bDMARDs. They are based on evidence and expert opinion and intended to improve outcome in patients with RA.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Rituximab		1
10979111	Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown. To determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. The Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. Three hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted. Incidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period. For all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use. In this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Aspirin		0
12835414	Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is a potent mediator of pain and inflammation, and high levels of this lipid mediator are observed in numerous disease states. The inhibition of PGE2 production to control pain and to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis to date has depended on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as aspirin. However, these agents inhibit the synthesis of all prostanoids. To produce biologically active PGE2, PGE synthases catalyze the isomerization of PGH2 into PGE2. Recently, several PGE synthases have been identified and cloned, but their role in inflammation is not clear. To study the physiological role of the individual PGE synthases, we have generated by targeted homologous recombination a mouse line deficient in microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) on the inbred DBA/1lacJ background. mPGES1-deficient (mPGES1-/-) mice are viable and fertile and develop normally compared with wild-type controls. However, mPGES1-/- mice displayed a marked reduction in inflammatory responses compared with mPGES1+/+ mice in multiple assays. Here, we identify mPGES1 as the PGE synthase that contributes to the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis, a disease model of human rheumatoid arthritis. We also show that mPGES1 is responsible for the production of PGE2 that mediates acute pain during an inflammatory response. These findings suggest that mPGES1 provides a target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain associated with inflammatory states.	Rheumatoid Arthritis		Aspirin		1
9751091	To investigate the efficacy and safety of SC-58635 (celecoxib), an antiinflammatory and analgesic agent that acts by selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition and is not expected to cause the typical gastrointestinal (GI), renal, and platelet-related side effects associated with inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme. Four phase II trials were performed: a 2-week osteoarthritis efficacy trial, a 4-week rheumatoid arthritis efficacy trial, a 1-week endoscopic study of GI mucosal effects, and a 1-week study of effects on platelet function. The 2 arthritis trials identified SC-58635 dosage levels that were consistently effective in treating the signs and symptoms of arthritis and were distinguished from placebo on standard arthritis scales. In the upper GI endoscopy study, 19% of subjects receiving naproxen (6 of 32) developed gastric ulcers, whereas no ulcers occurred in subjects receiving SC-58635 or placebo. The study of platelet effects revealed no meaningful effect of SC-58635 on platelet aggregation or thromboxane B2 levels, whereas aspirin caused significant decreases in 2 of 3 platelet aggregation measures and thromboxane B2 levels. In all 4 trials, SC-58635 was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. SC-58635 achieves analgesic and antiinflammatory efficacy in arthritis through selective COX-2 inhibition, without showing any evidence of 2 of the toxic effects of COX-1 inhibition associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

8618582	Acid suppression with famotidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, provides protection against gastric injury in normal subjects receiving short courses of aspirin or naproxen. The efficacy of famotidine in preventing peptic ulcers in patients receiving long-term therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is not known. We studied the efficacy of two doses of famotidine (20 mg and 40 mg, each given orally twice daily), as compared with placebo, in preventing peptic ulcers in 285 patients without peptic ulcers who were receiving long-term NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (82 percent) or osteoarthritis (18 percent). The patients were evaluated clinically and by endoscopy at base line and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. The evaluators were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of gastric or duodenal ulceration at 24 weeks. The cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers was 20 percent in the placebo group, 13 percent in the group of patients receiving 20 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.24 for the comparison with placebo), and 8 percent in the group receiving 40 mg of famotidine twice daily (P = 0.03 for the comparison with placebo). The proportion of patients in whom duodenal ulcers developed was significantly lower with both doses of famotidine than with placebo (13 percent in the placebo group, 4 percent in the low-dose famotidine group [P = 0.04], and 2 percent in the high-dose famotidine group [P = 0.01]). Both doses of famotidine were well tolerated. Treatment with high-dose famotidine significantly reduces the cumulative incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients with arthritis receiving long-term NSAID therapy.

21870978	Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin. In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P<0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P=0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P<0.001), and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P=0.42). In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality.

11519503	Despite current treatments, patients who have acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation have high rates of major vascular events. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel when given with aspirin in such patients. We randomly assigned 12,562 patients who had presented within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms to receive clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, followed by 75 mg once daily) (6259 patients) or placebo (6303 patients) in addition to aspirin for 3 to 12 months. The first primary outcome--a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--occurred in 9.3 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 11.4 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk with clopidogrel as compared with placebo, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). The second primary outcome--the first primary outcome or refractory ischemia--occurred in 16.5 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 18.8 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94; P<0.001). The percentages of patients with in-hospital refractory or severe ischemia, heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also significantly lower with clopidogrel. There were significantly more patients with major bleeding in the clopidogrel group than in the placebo group (3.7 percent vs. 2.7 percent; relative risk, 1.38; P=0.001), but there were not significantly more patients with episodes of life-threatening bleeding (2.2 percent [corrected] vs. 1.8 percent; P=0.13) or hemorrhagic strokes (0.1 percent vs. 0.1 percent). The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has beneficial effects in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. However, the risk of major bleeding is increased among patients treated with clopidogrel.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
11786451	To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events. Collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews). Randomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen. 287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens. "Serious vascular event": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. Overall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000. Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
8918275	Many clinical trials have evaluated the benefit of long-term use of antiplatelet drugs in reducing the risk of clinical thrombotic events. Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have potentially serious adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate. CAPRIE was a randomised, blinded, international trial designed to assess the relative efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome cluster of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; their relative safety was also assessed. The population studied comprised subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease manifested as either recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years. 19,185 patients, with more than 6300 in each of the clinical subgroups, were recruited over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1.91 years. There were 1960 first events included in the outcome cluster on which an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with clopidogrel had an annual 5.32% risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5.83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statistically significant (p = 0.043) relative-risk reduction of 8.7% in favour of clopidogrel (95% Cl 0.3-16.5). Corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative-risk reduction of 9.4%. There were no major differences in terms of safety. Reported adverse experiences in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups judged to be severe included rash (0.26% vs 0.10%), diarrhoea (0.23% vs 0.11%), upper gastrointestinal discomfort (0.97% vs 1.22%), intracranial haemorrhage (0.33% vs 0.47%), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0.52% vs 0.72%), respectively. There were ten (0.10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with significant reductions in neutrophils (< 1.2 x 10(9)/L) and 16 (0.17%) in the aspirin group. Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The overall safety profile of clopidogrel is at least as good as that of medium-dose aspirin.	Stroke		Aspirin		1
12114036	Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.	Stroke		Simvastatin		1
26039521	Statin therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events, but whether the addition of ezetimibe, a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can reduce the rate of cardiovascular events further is not known. We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial involving 18,144 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) if they were receiving lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if they were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 6 years. The median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary end point at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.016). Rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. When added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provided additional benefit. (Funded by Merck; IMPROVE-IT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00202878.).	Stroke		Simvastatin		1
12814710	Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although typically their plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol are similar to those in the general population. Previous evidence about the effects of lowering cholesterol in people with diabetes has been limited, and most diabetic patients do not currently receive cholesterol-lowering therapy despite their increased risk. 5963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) known to have diabetes, and an additional 14573 with occlusive arterial disease (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Prespecified analyses in these prior disease subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, were of first major coronary event (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and of first major vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke or revascularisation). Analyses were also conducted of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, intention to treat), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Both among the participants who presented with diabetes and among those who did not, there were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for major coronary events, for strokes, and for revascularisations. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%] placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40, p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period. The present study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.

22085343	In patients with established cardiovascular disease, residual cardiovascular risk persists despite the achievement of target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with statin therapy. It is unclear whether extended-release niacin added to simvastatin to raise low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is superior to simvastatin alone in reducing such residual risk. We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive extended-release niacin, 1500 to 2000 mg per day, or matching placebo. All patients received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe, 10 mg per day, if needed, to maintain an LDL cholesterol level of 40 to 80 mg per deciliter (1.03 to 2.07 mmol per liter). The primary end point was the first event of the composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome, or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization. A total of 3414 patients were randomly assigned to receive niacin (1718) or placebo (1696). The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. At 2 years, niacin therapy had significantly increased the median HDL cholesterol level from 35 mg per deciliter (0.91 mmol per liter) to 42 mg per deciliter (1.08 mmol per liter), lowered the triglyceride level from 164 mg per deciliter (1.85 mmol per liter) to 122 mg per deciliter (1.38 mmol per liter), and lowered the LDL cholesterol level from 74 mg per deciliter (1.91 mmol per liter) to 62 mg per deciliter (1.60 mmol per liter). The primary end point occurred in 282 patients in the niacin group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the placebo group (16.2%) (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.21; P=0.79 by the log-rank test). Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.81 mmol per liter), there was no incremental clinical benefit from the addition of niacin to statin therapy during a 36-month follow-up period, despite significant improvements in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

12814710	Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although typically their plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol are similar to those in the general population. Previous evidence about the effects of lowering cholesterol in people with diabetes has been limited, and most diabetic patients do not currently receive cholesterol-lowering therapy despite their increased risk. 5963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) known to have diabetes, and an additional 14573 with occlusive arterial disease (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Prespecified analyses in these prior disease subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, were of first major coronary event (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and of first major vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke or revascularisation). Analyses were also conducted of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, intention to treat), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Both among the participants who presented with diabetes and among those who did not, there were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for major coronary events, for strokes, and for revascularisations. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%] placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40, p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period. The present study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.

15016485	Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed. 3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first "major vascular event" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, "intention-to-treat"), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.

11815421	Previous studies have demonstrated that experimental hypercholesterolemia leads to neovascularization in the coronary artery vasa vasorum (VV). Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have beneficial effects independent of lipid lowering. We aimed to determine the effect of simvastatin on coronary VV neovascularization, in the absence of cholesterol lowering. Pigs were randomized to 3 groups fed a normal (N), high cholesterol (HC), or HC+simvastatin (HC+S) diet for 12 weeks. The proximal left anterior descending artery was isolated, scanned with micro-CT, and reconstructed. Quantification of the VV density in serial cross-sections along the vessel was then performed. LDL cholesterol was similarly increased in HC and HC+S compared with N. There was an increase in both VV density (4.7+/-0.3 versus 2.7+/-0.2 n/mm(2); P<0.05) and vessel wall area (3.1+/-0.2 versus 1.8+/-0.1 mm(2); P<0.05) in HC compared with N. The VV density in HC+S was preserved compared with HC (3.0+/-0.2 n/mm(2); P<0.05), despite similar increase in vessel wall area compared with N (2.5+/-0.1 mm(2); P<0.05). Coronary artery tissue expression of VEGF was increased in HC but not in HC+S compared with N. In parallel, immunoreactivity for HIF-1alpha, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was accentuated in the outer media in HC but not in HC+S compared with N. This study demonstrates that simvastatin attenuates hypoxia in the coronary artery wall and VV neovascularization in experimental hypercholesterolemia, despite no change in plasma lipids. These data are consistent with an additional mechanism for the vascular effects of the statins, independent of cholesterol lowering.	High Cholesterol		Simvastatin		0
11382730	Simvastatin attenuates ischemia and reperfusion in normocholesterolemic animals by stabilizing endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and inhibiting neutrophil-mediated injury. Because endothelial dysfunction is a detrimental effect of hypercholesterolemia, we examined whether short-term treatment with simvastatin could inhibit leukocyte-endothelium interaction and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. We studied leukocyte-endothelium interactions in apoE(-/-) mice fed a normal or a high-cholesterol diet after short-term (ie, 18 hours) simvastatin treatment. We also studied simvastatin treatment in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by subjecting apoE(-/-) mice to 30 minutes of ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet exhibited higher blood cholesterol levels, which were not affected by short-term simvastatin treatment. However, the increased leukocyte rolling and adherence that occurred in cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice (P<0.001 versus control diet) were significantly attenuated by simvastatin treatment (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion also experienced increased myocardial necrosis (P<0.01 versus control diet), which was significantly attenuated by simvastatin (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Simvastatin therapy also significantly increased vascular nitric oxide production in apoE(-/-) mice. Simvastatin attenuates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and ameliorates ischemic injury in hypercholesterolemic mice independently of lipid-lowering actions.	High Cholesterol		Simvastatin		0
9880379	From a physiological perspective, physical activity might be expected to decrease the risk of developing stroke. However, epidemiological studies of physical activity and stroke risk have yielded divergent findings. We therefore sought to examine the association between exercise and stroke risk. This was a prospective cohort study of 21 823 men, followed up for an average of 11.1 years. Participants were from the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene. Men, aged 40 to 84 years at baseline, were free of self-reported myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cancer. At baseline, they reported on the frequency of exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat. Stroke occurrence was reported by participants and confirmed after medical record review (n=533). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the data. With adjustment for age, treatment assignment, smoking, alcohol intake, history of angina, and parental history of myocardial infarction, the relative risks of total stroke associated with vigorous exercise <1 time, 1 time, 2 to 4 times, and >/=5 times per week at baseline were 1.00 (referent), 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1. 03), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.03), respectively; P for trend=0.04. In subgroup analyses, the inverse association appeared stronger with hemorrhagic than ischemic stroke. When we additionally adjusted for body mass index, history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus, corresponding relative risks for total stroke were 1.00 (referent), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.07), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.10), and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.13), respectively; P for trend=0.25. Exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat is associated with decreased stroke risk in men. In the present study, the inverse association with physical activity appeared to be mediated through beneficial effects on body weight, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and glucose tolerance. Apart from its favorable influences on these variables, physical activity had no significant residual association with stroke incidence.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
11182189	Beneficial effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular events may depend, at least in part, on their anti-inflammatory action. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of simvastatin and aspirin on serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in hypercholesterolemic subjects. In 33 asymptomatic men with total cholesterol (TC) >6.5 mmol l(-1) and in 25 men with coronary heart disease and borderline-high cholesterol levels (between 5.2 and 6.5 mmol l(-1)) chronically treated with low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d), serum levels of CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 were determined before and after a 3-month simvastatin therapy (20-40 mg daily). In the former group, these markers of inflammation were also measured before and after a 2-week treatment with aspirin (300 mg/d), implemented prior to and in combination with simvastatin. A distinct reduction of CRP and TNF-alpha was found in both groups; IL-6 levels were decreased only in subjects with marked hypercholesterolemia. Aspirin had no effect on the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin. In men with hypercholesterolemia simvastatin treatment lowers serum levels of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines. Low-dose aspirin does not add to the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
11171873	Previous studies of diet and coronary heart disease (CHD) have focused on intake of nutrients rather than whole foods. Because of the findings that dietary fibre, folate and antioxidants may be protective for CHD, increased intake of vegetables has been recommended. However, due to the chemical and physical complexity of vegetables, the effects of individual nutrients may differ if eaten as whole foods. Moreover, little is known about the direct association between vegetable intake and risk of CHD. We prospectively evaluated the relation between vegetable intake and CHD risk in the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of aspirin and beta-carotene among 22 071 US male physicians aged 40-84 years in 1982. In this analysis, we included 15 220 men without heart disease, stroke or cancer at baseline who provided information on their vegetable intake at baseline, and in the 2nd, 4th and 6th years of follow-up using a simple semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire including eight vegetables. We confirmed 1148 incident cases of CHD (387 incident cases of myocardial infarction and 761 incident cases of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) during 12 years of follow-up. After adjusting for age, randomized treatment, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, history of high cholesterol, and use of multivitamins, men who consumed at least 2.5 servings/day of vegetables had a relative risk (RR) of 0.77 (95% CI : 0.60-0.98) for CHD, compared with men in the lowest category (<1 serving/day). Adjusting for the same covariates in an analysis of the overall trend that considered intake of vegetables as a continuous variable, we found a RR of 0.83 (95% CI : 0.71-0.98) for risk of CHD for each additional serving/day of vegetables. The inverse relation between vegetable intake and CHD risk was more evident among men with a BMI > or =25 (RR = 0.71, 95% CI : 0.51-0.99) or current smokers (RR = 0.40, 95% CI : 0.18-0.86) comparing highest to the lowest categories of intake. Our results suggest an inverse association between vegetable intake and risk of CHD. These prospective data support current dietary guidelines to increase vegetable intake for the prevention of CHD.

15897342	Homeless people represent an extremely disadvantaged group in North America. Among older homeless men, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death. The objective of this study was to examine cardiovascular risk factors in a representative sample of homeless adults and identify opportunities for improved risk factor modification. Homeless persons were randomly selected at shelters for single adults in Toronto. Response rate was 79%. Participants (n=202) underwent interviews, physical measurements, and blood sampling. The mean age of participants was 42 years, and 89% were men. The prevalence of smoking among homeless subjects (78%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72% to 84%) was significantly higher than in the general population (standardized morbidity ratio [SMR], 254; 95% CI, 216 to 297). Hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes were not more prevalent than in the general population but were often poorly controlled. Homeless men were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than men in the general population (SMR, 79; 95% CI, 63 to 98). Cocaine use in the last year was reported by 29% of subjects (95% CI, 23% to 36%). CVD was reported by 15% of subjects, fewer than one third of whom reported taking aspirin or cholesterol-lowering medication. According to multiple-risk-factor equations, the median estimated 10-year absolute risk of myocardial infarction or coronary death among homeless men aged 30 to 74 years was 5% (interquartile range, 3% to 9%). Cardiovascular risk factor modification is suboptimal among homeless adults in Toronto, despite universal health insurance. Multiple risk factor equations may underestimate true risk in this population because of inadequate accounting for factors such as cocaine use and heavy smoking.	High Cholesterol		Aspirin		0
12114036	Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.

9547437	Although treatment of myocardial overload effectively reduces death from progression of heart failure, it is not known whether the retardation of progressive coronary artery disease obtained with lipid lowering treatment will prevent the onset and consequences of heart failure in patients without previous symptoms of heart failure. In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, 4444 patients with coronary heart disease without evidence of heart failure were randomized to placebo (n = 2223) or simvastatin 20-40 mg (n = 2221) and followed for more than 5 years. Among the patients who received placebo, 228 (10.3%) were diagnosed with heart failure during follow-up evaluation compared with 184 (8.3%) of patients who received simvastatin (P < .015). Mortality was 31.9% in the placebo group and 25.5% in the simvastatin group among patients who developed heart failure. These compare with 9.2 and 6.6%, respectively, among non-heart failure patients. There were 45 hospitalizations because of acute heart failure in the placebo group and 23 in the simvastatin group (NS). Patients who developed heart failure were more likely to have suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction and have a history of diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension than patients who did not develop congestive heart failure. Long-term prevention with simvastatin reduces the occurrence of heart failure in a cohort of patients with coronary heart disease without previous evidence of congestive heart failure.
