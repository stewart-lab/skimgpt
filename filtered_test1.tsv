0	657735	Alzheimer's	646	"[""PMID 9600986: Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways."", ""PMID 20655099: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. It has emerged that Abeta toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Deltatau) and absence of tau in tau(-/-) mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Abeta toxicity. Deltatau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Abeta-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Abeta toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD."", ""PMID 35820485: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatase and a key regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways. While PP2A dysfunction has been linked to human cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), PP2A regulation remains relatively poorly understood. It has been reported that the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) is inactivated by a single phosphorylation at the Tyr307 residue by tyrosine kinases such as v-Src. However, multiple mass spectrometry studies have revealed the existence of other putative PP2Ac phosphorylation sites in response to activation of Src and Fyn, two major Src family kinases (SFKs). Here, using PP2Ac phosphomutants and novel phosphosite-specific PP2Ac antibodies, we show that cellular pools of PP2Ac are instead phosphorylated on both Tyr127 and Tyr284 upon Src activation, and on Tyr284 following Fyn activation. We found these phosphorylation events enhanced the interaction of PP2Ac with SFKs. In addition, we reveal SFK-mediated phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Y284 promotes dissociation of the regulatory Bα subunit, altering PP2A substrate specificity; the phosphodeficient Y127/284F and Y284F PP2Ac mutants prevented SFK-mediated phosphorylation of Tau at the CP13 (pSer202) epitope, a pathological hallmark of AD, and SFK-dependent activation of ERK, a major growth regulatory kinase upregulated in many cancers. Our findings demonstrate a novel PP2A regulatory mechanism that challenges the existing dogma on the inhibition of PP2A catalytic activity by Tyr307 phosphorylation. We propose dysregulation of SFK signaling in cancer and AD can lead to alterations in PP2A phosphorylation and subsequent deregulation of key PP2A substrates, including ERK and Tau."", ""PMID 36639708: Synaptic degeneration is a precursor of synaptic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology (FTD-tau), a group of primary tauopathies. A critical role in this degenerative process is assumed by enzymes such as the kinase Fyn and its counterpart, the phosphatase striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP<sub>61</sub>). Whereas the role of Fyn has been widely explored, less is known about STEP<sub>61</sub> that localises to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic neurons. In dementias, synaptic loss is associated with an increased burden of pathological aggregates. Tau pathology is a hallmark of both AD (together with amyloid-β deposition) and FTD-tau. Here, we examined STEP<sub>61</sub> and its activity in human and animal brain tissue and observed a correlation between STEP<sub>61</sub> and disease progression. In early-stage human AD, an initial increase in the level and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> was observed, which decreased with the loss of the synaptic marker PSD-95; in FTD-tau, there was a reduction in STEP<sub>61</sub> and PSD-95 which correlated with clinical diagnosis. In APP23 mice with an amyloid-β pathology, the level and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> were increased in the synaptic fraction compared to wild-type littermates. Similarly, in the K3 mouse model of FTD-tau, which we assessed at two ages compared to wild-type, expression and activity of STEP<sub>61</sub> were increased with ageing. Together, these findings suggest that STEP contributes differently to the pathogenic process in AD and FTD-tau, and that its activation may be an early response to a degenerative process."", ""PMID 35253743: Increasing evidence links impaired brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence prompted a search for molecular players common to AD and diabetes mellitus (DM). The work incorporated studies based on a primary care-based cohort (pcb-Cohort) and a bioinformatics analysis to identify central nodes, that are key players in AD and insulin signaling (IS) pathways. The interactome for each of these key proteins was retrieved and network maps were developed for AD and IS. Synaptic enrichment was performed to reveal synaptic common hubs. Cohort analysis showed that individuals with DM exhibited a correlation with poor performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive test. Additionally, APOE ɛ2 allele carriers appear to potentially be relatively more protected against both DM and cognitive deficits. Ten clusters were identified in this network and 32 key synaptic proteins were common to AD and IS. Given the relevance of signaling pathways, another network was constructed focusing on protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and the top 6 kinase nodes (LRRK2, GSK3B, AKT1, EGFR, MAPK1, and FYN) were further analyzed. This allowed the elaboration of signaling cascades directly impacting AβPP and tau, whereby distinct signaling pathway play a major role and strengthen an AD-IS link at a molecular level.""]"	0.0614487510800821	0.5372071064802428	0.0178704805112174	36149	FYN	96	['PMID 36532777: Major surgery induces systemic inflammation leading to pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Endothelial inflammation is one of the drivers of postoperative organ damage, including acute kidney injury Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) is an important component of surgery-induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. Kinases, the backbone of signalling cascades, can be targeted by pharmacological inhibition. This is a promising treatment option to interfere with excessive endothelial inflammation. In this study, we identified activated kinases as potential therapeutic targets. These targets were pharmacologically inhibited to reduce TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells. Kinome profiling using PamChip arrays identified 64 protein tyrosine kinases and 88 serine-threonine kinases, the activity of which was determined at various timepoints (5-240\xa0min) following stimulation with 10\xa0ng/ml TNF-α in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. The PTKs Axl and Fyn were selected based on high kinase activity profiles. Co-localisation experiments with the endothelial-specific protein CD31 showed Axl expression in endothelial cells of glomeruli and Fyn in arterioles and glomeruli of both control and TNF-α-exposed mice. Pharmacological inhibition with Axl inhibitor BMS-777607 and Fyn inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory activation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 at mRNA and VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 at protein level in HUVEC <i>in vitro</i>. Upon pharmacological inhibition with each inhibitor, leukocyte adhesion to HUVEC was also significantly reduced, however to a minor extent. In conclusion, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with kinase inhibitors BMS-777607 and PP2 reduces TNF-α-induced endothelial inflammation <i>in vitro</i>.', 'PMID 34238111: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumour in the central nervous system (CNS). As the ideal targets for GBM treatment, Src family kinases (SFKs) have attracted much attention. Herein, a new series of imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2-one derivatives were designed and synthesised as SFK inhibitors. Compounds <b>1d</b>, <b>1e</b>, <b>1q</b>, <b>1s</b> exhibited potential Src and Fyn kinase inhibition in the submicromolar range, of which were next tested for their antiproliferative potency on four GBM cell lines. Compound <b>1s</b> showed effective activity against U87, U251, T98G, and U87-EGFRvIII GBM cell lines, comparable to that of lead compound PP2. Molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation revealed the possible binding patterns of the most active compound <b>1s</b> in ATP binding site of SFKs. ADME prediction suggested that <b>1s</b> accord with the criteria of CNS drugs. These results led us to identify a novel SFK inhibitor as candidate for GBM treatment.', 'PMID 35185557: Drug-associated context-induced relapse of cocaine-seeking behaviour requires the retrieval of drug-associated memory. Studies exploring the underlying neurobiological mechanism of drug memory formation will likely contribute to the development of treatments for drug addiction and the prevention of relapse. In our study, we applied a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and a self-administration paradigm (two drug-associated memory formation model) to confirm the hypothesis that the Src kinase Fyn critically regulates cocaine-associated memory formation in the hippocampus. For this experiment, we administered the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 into the bilateral hippocampus before cocaine-CPP and self-administration training, and the results showed that pharmacological manipulation of the Src kinase Fyn activity significantly attenuated the response to cocaine-paired cues in the cocaine-CPP and self-administration paradigms, indicating that hippocampal Fyn activity contributes to cocaine-associated memory formation. In addition, the regulation of cocaine-associated memory formation by Fyn depends on Tau expression, as restoring Tau to normal levels disrupted cocaine memory formation. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal Fyn activity plays a key role in the formation of cocaine-associated memory, which underlies cocaine-associated contextual stimulus-mediated regulation of cocaine-seeking behaviour, suggesting that Fyn represents a promising therapeutic target for weakening cocaine-related memory and treating cocaine addiction.']	0.20775012657002	7.080303933178968e-58	0.0091254752851711	10520	PP2	36691282
