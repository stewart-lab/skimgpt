Assessment Task:
Evaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis, which posits a significant interaction between {a_term} and {b_term}. 
The texts provided above come from PubMed and each abstract will include only {a_term} and {b_term}. 
The texts need to be your only source of information for arriving at your classification result. 

IMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above. Do not reference or cite any external literature or PMIDs not in the list above.

Hypothesis:
{hypothesis_template}

Instructions:
1. Review each abstract to understand how {a_term} and {b_term} might be interconnected based on the available information.
2. Analyze the presence and implications of the term pairing ({a_term} + {b_term}) in the context of the hypothesis.
3. Synthesize the findings from multiple texts. Consider how the pieces fit together to support or refute the hypothesis: {hypothesis_template}. Remember, no single text may be conclusive.
4. Provide a justification for your scoring decision based on the analysis. Explain your reasoning step-by-step in terms understandable to an undergraduate biochemist. Focus on explaining the logical connections and the directionality of relationships.
5. Cite specific texts from your set of abstracts to support your arguments. Only cite PMIDs from the list above, and clearly reference these citations in your reasoning using the format "PMID: XXXXX".

Available PMIDs for Citation: {pmid_list}

Assessment Task:
Evaluate the degree of support for the hypothesis: {hypothesis_template}, which posits an interaction between {a_term} and {c_term}. Use only the provided abstracts from PubMed that mention {a_term} and {c_term} to inform your analysis.

IMPORTANT: You must only cite PMIDs that are explicitly provided in the abstracts above. Do not reference or cite any external literature or PMIDs not in the list above.

Your evaluation should:

• Integrate evidence from all abstracts to discern how {a_term} and {c_term} might be interconnected.
• Employ logical reasoning, drawing logical inferences where appropriate, based on the interaction between {a_term} and {c_term}.
• Assess the nature and directionality of the interaction, determining whether they are beneficial or detrimental to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.
• Be vigilant for any evidence that contradicts or challenges the hypothesis, explicitly addressing any contradictions in your reasoning.
• Avoid inferring effects not supported by the texts, ensuring that all conclusions are grounded in the provided information.
• Ensure that your scoring reflects an unbiased assessment based solely on the provided evidence, considering logical inferences from evidence.
• When citing evidence, use the PMID format (e.g., "PMID: 12345678") and only cite PMIDs from the list above.

**Examples:**

• **Example 1: Strong Positive Outcome**
  - **Hypothesis:** {c_term} treats {a_term}.
  - **Evidence:**
     Multiple abstracts show that {c_term} **inhibits processes that worsen {a_term}**.
     Inhibition of these processes significantly **improves {a_term}** in various contexts.
  - **Logical Conclusion:**
     Since {c_term} inhibits harmful processes, and inhibition of these processes improves {a_term}, there is strong, consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis.
  - **Scoring:**
     The interactions are consistent and beneficial.
     **Assigned Score:** **+2**

• **Example 2: Likely Positive Outcome**
  - **Hypothesis:** {c_term} treats {a_term}.
  - **Evidence:**
     Some abstracts suggest that {c_term} **may activate beneficial pathways affecting {a_term}**.
     Activation of these pathways might improve {a_term}, but evidence is limited or not robust.
  - **Logical Conclusion:**
     There is evidence indicating potential beneficial interaction, but some uncertainty exists due to limited data or minor contradictions.
  - **Scoring:**
     The hypothesis is likely supported by the evidence.
     **Assigned Score:** **+1**

• **Example 3: Neutral Outcome**
  - **Hypothesis:** {c_term} treats {a_term}.
  - **Evidence:**
     Abstracts provide insufficient or inconclusive information about the interaction.
     Evidence might be mixed or does not directly relate to the hypothesis.
  - **Logical Conclusion:**
     There is not enough evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.
  - **Scoring:**
     The evidence is inconclusive.
     **Assigned Score:** **0**

• **Example 4: Likely Negative Outcome**
  - **Hypothesis:** {c_term} treats {a_term}.
  - **Evidence:**
     Some abstracts indicate that {c_term} **activates processes that worsen {a_term}**.
     Activation of these processes may worsen {a_term}, but evidence is limited or not definitive.
  - **Logical Conclusion:**
     There is substantial indication that the interaction may be detrimental to the proposed outcome, but some uncertainty or exceptions exist.
  - **Scoring:**
     The hypothesis is likely refuted based on the evidence.
     **Assigned Score:** **-1**

• **Example 5: Strong Negative Outcome**
  - **Hypothesis:** {c_term} treats {a_term}.
  - **Evidence:**
     Multiple abstracts consistently show that {c_term} **inhibits beneficial processes for {a_term}**.
     Inhibition of these processes clearly worsens {a_term} across various studies.
     No evidence suggests any interaction aligns with supporting the hypothesis.
  - **Logical Conclusion:**
     Since {c_term} inhibits beneficial processes, and inhibition of these processes worsens {a_term}, the hypothesis is clearly refuted by strong, consistent evidence.
  - **Scoring:**
     The interaction does not align with supporting the hypothesis.
     **Assigned Score:** **-2**

Your goal is to determine the degree of support for the hypothesis:

**Instructions:**

1. **Review each abstract** to understand how {a_term} and {c_term} might be interconnected based on the available information.
2. **Analyze the presence and implications** of the interaction between {a_term} and {c_term} in the context of the hypothesis.
3. **Carefully assess whether the interaction is beneficial or detrimental** to the proposed outcome in the hypothesis.
4. **Synthesize the findings from multiple texts**, considering how the pieces fit together to support or refute the hypothesis: {hypothesis_template}.
5. **Provide a justification for your scoring decision** based on the analysis. **Explain your reasoning step-by-step** in terms understandable to an undergraduate biochemist. Focus on:

6. **Be vigilant for any evidence that contradicts or challenges the hypothesis**. Address any contradictions explicitly in your reasoning.
7. **Verify any assumptions about the roles and effects** of {a_term} and {c_term} as presented in the abstracts. **Avoid inferring effects not supported by the texts**.
8. In your final assessment, **explicitly cite the scoring guideline** that corresponds to your conclusion. **Explain why the evidence meets the criteria for that specific score**.

**Note:** Pay close attention to the nature of the interaction between entities. An interaction that activates a harmful process may be detrimental, while inhibition of a beneficial process may also be detrimental. **Consider whether such interaction contradicts the hypothesis**.

**Definitions:**
• **Evidence:** Multiple sources agree and provide clear indications supporting a particular interaction and its effects.
• **Contradictory Evidence:** Evidence that directly opposes the hypothesis, showing that the proposed mechanism of action does not produce the expected outcome.

**Checklist Before Finalizing Your Response:**
• Have you **addressed whether the interaction supports or contradicts the hypothesis**?
