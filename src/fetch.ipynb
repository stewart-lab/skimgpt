       "[[\"Warfarin is a highly efficacious oral anticoagulant, but its use is limited by a well-founded fear of bleeding. Drug and food interactions are frequently cited as causes of adverse events with warfarin. We provide an updated systematic overview of the quality, clinical effect, and importance of these reported interactions. MEDLINE, TOXLINE, IPA, and EMBASE databases from October 1993 to March 2004. Database searches combined the keyword warfarin with drug interactions, herbal medicines, Chinese herbal drugs, and food-drug interactions. Eligible articles contained original reports of warfarin drug or food interactions in human subjects. Non-English articles were included if sufficient information could be abstracted. Reports were rated independently by 2 investigators for interaction direction, clinical severity, and quality of evidence. Quality of evidence was based on previously validated causation criteria and study design. Of 642 citations retrieved, 181 eligible articles contained original reports on 120 drugs or foods. Inter-rater agreement was excellent, with weighted kappa values of 0.84 to 1.00. Of all reports, 72% described a potentiation of warfarin's effect and 84% were of poor quality, 86% of which were single case reports. The 31 incidents of clinically significant bleeding were all single case reports. Newly reported interactions included celecoxib, rofecoxib, and herbal substances, such as green tea and danshen. The number of drugs reported to interact with warfarin continues to expand. While most reports are of poor quality and present potentially misleading conclusions, the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil, suggests that coadministration with warfarin should be avoided or closely monitored. More systematic study of warfarin drug interactions in patients is urgently needed.\",\n",
       "  \"To evaluate the quality of studies about drugs and food interactions with warfarin and their clinical relevance. MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases from 1966 to October 1993 using the Medical Subject Headings warfarin, drug interactions, and English only. All articles reporting original data on drug and food interactions with warfarin. Each report, rated independently by at least two investigators (using causality assessment), received a summary score indicating the level of assurance (level 1 = highly probable, level 2 = probable, level 3 = possible, and level 4 = doubtful) that a clinically important interaction had or had not occurred. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a weighted kappa statistic. Of 793 retrieved citations, 120 contained original reports on 186 interactions. The weighted kappa statistic was 0.67, representing substantial agreement. Of 86 different drugs and foods appraised, 43 had level 1 evidence. Of these, 26 drugs and foods did interact with warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was potentiated by 6 antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, isoniazid, metronidazole, and miconazole); 5 cardiac drugs (amiodarone, clofibrate, propafenone, propranolol, and sulfinpyrazone); phenylbutazone; piroxicam; alcohol (only with concomitant liver disease); cimetidine; and omeprazole. Three patients had a hemorrhage at the time of a potentiating interaction (caused by alcohol, isoniazid, and phenylbutazone). Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was inhibited by 3 antibiotics (griseofulvin, rifampin, and nafcillin); 3 drugs active on the central nervous system (barbiturates, carbamazepine, and chlordiazepoxide); cholestyramine; sucralfate; foods high in vitamin K; and large amounts of avocado. Many drugs and foods interact with warfarin, including antibiotics, drugs affecting the central nervous system, and cardiac medications. Many of these drug interactions increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect.\",\n",
       "  'Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used extensively for the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders, often over the long term, which raises the potential for clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving concomitant medications. These drug-drug interactions have been previously reviewed. However, the current knowledge is likely to have advanced, so a thorough review of the literature published since 2006 was conducted. This identified new studies of drug interactions that are modulated by gastric pH. These studies showed the effect of a PPI-induced increase in intragastric pH on mycophenolate mofetil pharmacokinetics, which were characterised by a decrease in the maximum exposure and availability of mycophenolic acid, at least at early time points. Post-2006 data were also available outlining the altered pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors with concomitant PPI exposure. New data for the more recently marketed dexlansoprazole suggest it has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin. The CYP2C19-mediated interaction that seems to exist between clopidogrel and omeprazole or esomeprazole has been shown to be clinically important in research published since the 2006 review; this effect is not seen as a class effect of PPIs. Finally, data suggest that coadministration of PPIs with methotrexate may affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics, although the mechanism of interaction is not well understood. As was shown in the previous review, individual PPIs differ in their propensities to interact with other drugs and the extent to which their interaction profiles have been defined. The interaction profiles of omeprazole and pantoprazole sodium (pantoprazole-Na) have been studied most extensively. Several studies have shown that omeprazole carries a considerable potential for drug interactions because of its high affinity for CYP2C19 and moderate affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole-Na appears to have lower potential for interactions with other medications. Lansoprazole and rabeprazole also seem to have a weaker potential for interactions than omeprazole, although their interaction profiles, along with those of esomeprazole and dexlansoprazole, have been less extensively investigated. Only a few drug interactions involving PPIs are of clinical significance. Nonetheless, the potential for drug interactions should be considered when choosing a PPI to manage gastric acid-related disorders. This is particularly relevant for elderly patients taking multiple medications, or for those receiving a concomitant medication with a narrow therapeutic index.',\n",
       "  \"* Numerous cocktails using concurrent administration of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-selective probe drugs have been reported to investigate drug-drug interactions in vivo. * This approach has several advantages: characterize the inhibitory or induction potential of compounds in development toward the CYP enzymes identified in vitro in an in vivo situation, assess several enzymes in the same trial, and have complete in vivo information about potential CYP-based drug interactions. * This study describes a new cocktail containing five probe drugs that has never been published. * This cocktail can be used to test the effects of a new chemical entity on multiple CYP isoforms in a single clinical study: CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A (midazolam) and was designed to overcome potential liabilities of other reported cocktails. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selective substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol) and CYP3A (midazolam) when administered orally and concurrently as a cocktail relative to the drugs administered alone. This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, six-treatment six-period six-sequence William's design study with a wash-out of 7 or 14 days. Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC. There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25. The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo.\",\n",
       "  'Paritaprevir (administered with ritonavir, PTV/r), ombitasvir (OBV), and dasabuvir (DSV) are direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Thirteen studies were conducted to characterize drug-drug interactions for the 3D regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV and various medications in healthy volunteers to inform dosing recommendations in HCV-infected patients. Mechanism-based drug-drug interactions were evaluated for gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, carbamazepine, warfarin, omeprazole, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin. Drug-drug interactions with medications commonly used in HCV-infected patients were evaluated for amlodipine, furosemide, alprazolam, zolpidem, duloxetine, escitalopram, methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone, and oral contraceptives. Ratios of geometric means with 90% confidence intervals for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were used to determine the magnitude of interaction. Coadministration with the 3D regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV resulted in a <2-fold change in mean Cmax and AUC for most medications and the DAAs, indicating minimal to modest interactions. Carbamazepine decreased PTV, ritonavir, and DSV exposures substantially, while gemfibrozil increased DSV exposures substantially. Although coadministration with ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives resulted in elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, coadministration with a progestin-only contraceptive did not. The majority of medications can be coadministered with the 3D regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV without dose adjustment, or with clinical monitoring or dose adjustment. Although no dose adjustment is necessary for the 3D regimen when coadministered with 17 of the 20 medications, coadministration with gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, or ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives is contraindicated.',\n",
       "  'Esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor (PPI) developed as a single isomer for the treatment of patients with acid related diseases. Because of the extensive use of PPIs, the documentation of the potential for drug interactions with esomeprazole is of great importance. Altered absorption or metabolism are 2 of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions. Since intragastric pH will increase with esomeprazole treatment, it can be hypothesised that the absorption of drugs with pH-sensitive absorption (e.g. digoxin and ketoconazole) may be affected. Esomeprazole does not seem to have any potential to interact with drugs that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 or 2E1. In drug interaction studies with diazepam, phenytoin and (R)-warfarin, it was shown that esomeprazole has the potential to interact with CYP2C19. The slightly altered metabolism of cisapride was also suggested to be the result of inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for cisapride mediated by CYP2C19. Esomeprazole did not interact with the CYP3A4 substrates clarithromycin (2 studies) or quinidine. Since the slightly increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of cisapride could be explained as an inhibition of CYP2C19, the data on these 3 CYP3A4 substrates indicate that esomeprazole does not have the potential to inhibit this enzyme. The minor effects reported for diazepam, phenytoin, (R)-warfarin, and cisapride are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Clarithromycin interacts with the metabolism of esomeprazole resulting in a doubling of the AUC of esomeprazole. The increased plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are unlikely to have any safety implications. It can be concluded that the potential for drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole is low, and similar to that reported for omeprazole.',\n",
       "  'Two phase I drug interaction studies were performed with oral enzalutamide, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A parallel-treatment design (n\\xa0=\\xa041) was used to evaluate the effects of a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 inhibitor (oral gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (oral itraconazole 200\\xa0mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and its active metabolite N-desmethyl enzalutamide after a single dose of enzalutamide (160\\xa0mg). A single-sequence crossover design (n\\xa0=\\xa014) was used to determine the effects of enzalutamide 160\\xa0mg/day on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of sensitive substrates for CYP2C8 (pioglitazone 30\\xa0mg), CYP2C9 (warfarin 10\\xa0mg), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 20\\xa0mg), or CYP3A4 (midazolam 2\\xa0mg). Coadministration of gemfibrozil increased the composite area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC∞) of enzalutamide plus active metabolite by 2.2-fold, and coadministration of itraconazole increased the composite AUC∞ by 1.3-fold. Enzalutamide did not affect exposure to oral pioglitazone. Enzalutamide reduced the AUC∞ of oral S-warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam by 56, 70, and 86\\xa0%, respectively; therefore, enzalutamide is a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and a strong inducer of CYP3A4. If a patient requires coadministration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor with enzalutamide, then the enzalutamide dose should be reduced to 80\\xa0mg/day. It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, as enzalutamide may decrease their exposure.',\n",
       "  \"St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum, SJW) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants for the treatment of minor to moderate depression. A major safety concern about SJW is its ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and/or clinical response of a variety of clinically important drugs that have distinctive chemical structure, mechanism of action and metabolic pathways. This review highlights and updates the knowledge on clinical interactions of prescribed drugs with SJW and the implication in drug development. A number of clinically significant interactions of SJW have been identified with conventional drugs, including anticancer agents (imatinib and irinotecan), anti-HIV agents (e.g. indinavir, lamivudine and nevirapine), anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. ibuprofen and fexofenadine), antimicrobial agents (e.g. erythromycin and voriconazole), cardiovascular drugs (e.g. digoxin, ivabradine, warfarin, verapamil, nifedipine and talinolol), central nervous system agents (e.g. amitriptyline, buspirone, phenytoin, methadone, midazolam, alprazolam, and sertraline), hypoglycaemic agents (e.g. tolbutamide and gliclazide), immuno-modulating agents (e.g. cyclosporine and tacrolimus), oral contraceptives, proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole), respiratory system agent (e.g. theophylline), statins (e.g. atorvastatin and pravastatin). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in the interactions of drugs with SJW. For pharmacokinetic changes of drugs by SJW, induction of cytochrome P450s (e.g. CYP2C9 and 3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are considered the major mechanism. Thus, it is not a surprise that many drugs that interact with SJW are substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp. A comprehensive understanding of clinical drugs that interact with SJW has important implications in drug development. New drugs may be designed to minimize interactions with SJW; and new SJW formulations may be designed to avoid drug interactions. Further clinical and mechanistic studies are warranted to explore the interaction of SJW with other important drugs and the potential clinical impact.\",\n",
       "  'Pazopanib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-kit kinases, inhibits multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in vitro. This study in patients with advanced cancer evaluated the effect of pazopanib on CYP450 function by comparing the pharmacokinetics of CYP-specific probe drugs in the presence and absence of pazopanib. The probes used included midazolam (CYP3A specific), warfarin (CYP2C9 specific), omeprazole (CYP2C19 specific), caffeine (CYP1A2 specific), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 specific). The estimated ratios of the geometric means (90% confidence interval (CI)) for the area under the curve to the last measurable point (AUC(0-t)) for these probe drugs with/without pazopanib were as follows: midazolam, 1.35 (1.18-1.54); omeprazole, 0.81 (0.59-1.12); caffeine, 1.00 (0.77-1.30); and S-warfarin, 0.93 (0.84-1.03). The geometric least-squares (LS) mean ratio of urine dextromethorphan:dextrorphan ranged from 1.33 (0-4-h interval) to 1.64 (4-8-h interval). The data suggest that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and has no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in patients with advanced cancer.',\n",
       "  'Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions influence drug efficacy, tolerability, and compliance. Such interactions are both more common and of more clinical relevance than often appreciated. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products have recently issued guidelines setting out in vitro and in vivo investigations to be conducted during drug development. These guidelines reflect the increasing interest of public health authorities in this topic. Cerivastatin is a novel, potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels at low daily doses. It is completely absorbed after oral administration, undergoes moderate first-pass metabolism and high plasma protein binding, and is cleared exclusively via hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP). Unlike other drugs of its class, cerivastatin has a dual metabolic pathway, with the involvement of more than one CYP isozyme. Metabolites are cleared via both biliary and renal excretion. On the basis of this pharmacokinetic profile and a knowledge of the target population, the formal in vivo interaction programme for cerivastatin investigated many important potential cerivastatin drug-drug interactions. Cerivastatin appears to lack clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, warfarin, antacid, cimetidine, nifedipine, omeprazole, erythromycin and itraconazole.'],\n",
       " ['This article reviews the metabolic pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the systemic antifungal agents: the azoles ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, the allylamine terbinafine and the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole. The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.',\n",
       "  'The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. As a group, these drugs are well tolerated apart from two uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects: elevation of liver enzymes and skeletal muscle abnormalities, which range from benign myalgias to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Adverse effects with statins are frequently associated with drug interactions because of their long-term use in older patients who are likely to be exposed to polypharmacy. The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin as a result of deaths from rhabdomyolysis illustrates the clinical importance of such interactions. Drug interactions involving the statins may have either a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic basis, or both. As these drugs are highly extracted by the liver, displacement interactions are of limited importance. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system plays an important part in the metabolism of the statins, leading to clinically relevant interactions with other agents, particularly cyclosporin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, that are also metabolised by this enzyme system. An additional complicating feature is that individual statins are metabolised to differing degrees, in some cases producing active metabolites. The CYP3A family metabolises lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, whereas CYP2C9 metabolises fluvastatin. Cerivastatin is also metabolised by CYP2C8. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by the CYP system. In addition, the statins are substrates for P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter present in the small intestine that may influence their oral bioavailability. In clinical practice, the risk of a serious interaction causing myopathy is enhanced when statin metabolism is markedly inhibited. Thus, rhabdomyolysis has occurred following the coadministration of cyclosporin, a potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, and lovastatin. Itraconazole has been shown to increase exposure to simvastatin and its active metabolite by at least 10-fold. Pharmacodynamically, there is an increased risk of myopathy when statins are coprescribed with fibrates or nicotinic acid. This occurs relatively infrequently, but is particularly associated with the combination of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil. Statins may also alter the concentrations of other drugs, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the statins should allow the avoidance of the majority of drug interactions. If concurrent therapy with known inhibitors of statin metabolism is necessary, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and the statin should be discontinued if necessary.',\n",
       "  \"Ezetimibe is the first lipid-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised (>80%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.\",\n",
       "  'Bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Following oral administration, bosentan attains peak plasma concentrations after approximately 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability is about 50%. Food does not exert a clinically relevant effect on absorption at the recommended dose of 125 mg. Bosentan is approximately 98% bound to albumin and, during multiple-dose administration, has a volume of distribution of 30 L and a clearance of 17 L/h. The terminal half-life after oral administration is 5.4 hours and is unchanged at steady state. Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 3-5 days after multiple-dose administration, when plasma concentrations are decreased by about 50% because of a 2-fold increase in clearance, probably due to induction of metabolising enzymes. Bosentan is mainly eliminated from the body by hepatic metabolism and subsequent biliary excretion of the metabolites. Three metabolites have been identified, formed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4. The metabolite Ro 48-5033 may contribute 20% to the total response following administration of bosentan. The pharmacokinetics of bosentan are dose-proportional up to 600 mg (single dose) and 500 mg/day (multiple doses). The pharmacokinetics of bosentan in paediatric PAH patients are comparable to those in healthy subjects, whereas adult PAH patients show a 2-fold increased exposure. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min) and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) do not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of bosentan. No dosage adjustment in adults is required based on sex, age, ethnic origin and bodyweight. Bosentan should generally be avoided in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and/or elevated liver aminotransferases. Ketoconazole approximately doubles the exposure to bosentan because of inhibition of CYP3A4. Bosentan decreases exposure to ciclosporin, glibenclamide, simvastatin (and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin) and (R)- and (S)-warfarin by up to 50% because of induction of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9. Coadministration of ciclosporin and bosentan markedly increases initial bosentan trough concentrations. Concomitant treatment with glibenclamide and bosentan leads to an increase in the incidence of aminotransferase elevations. Therefore, combined use with ciclosporin and glibenclamide is contraindicated and not recommended, respectively. The possibility of reduced efficacy of CYP2C9 and 3A4 substrates should be considered when coadministered with bosentan. No clinically relevant interaction was detected with the P-glycoprotein substrate digoxin. In healthy subjects, bosentan doses >300 mg increase plasma levels of endothelin-1. The drug moderately reduces blood pressure, and its main adverse effects are headache, flushing, increased liver aminotransferases, leg oedema and anaemia. In a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study in PAH patients, the haemodynamic effects lagged the plasma concentrations of bosentan.',\n",
       "  \"There is a worldwide increasing use of herbs which are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potential for herb-drug interactions. St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants. A literature search was performed using Medline (via Pubmed), Biological Abstracts, Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO and Embase (all from their inception to September 2003) to identify known drug interaction with St John's wort. The available data indicate that St John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PgP), although it may inhibit or induce other CYPs, depending on the dose, route and duration of administration. Data from human studies and case reports indicate that St John's wort decreased the blood concentrations of amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, fexofenadine, indinavir, methadone, midazolam, nevirapine, phenprocoumon, simvastatin, tacrolimus, theophylline and warfarin, whereas it did not alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, dextromethorphan, mycophenolic acid and pravastatin. St John's wort decreased the plasma concentration of the active metabolite SN-38 in cancer patients receiving irinotecan treatment. St John's wort did not alter the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, but increased the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Several cases have been reported that St John's wort decreased cyclosporine blood concentration leading to organ rejection. St John's wort caused breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancies when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives. It also caused serotonin syndrome when coadministered with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (e.g. sertaline and paroxetine). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in these interactions. Because the potential interaction of St John's wort with other drugs is a major safety concern, additional systematic research on herb-drug interactions and appropriate regulation in herbal safety and efficacy is needed.\",\n",
       "  \"Use of herbal medicines among patients under cardiovascular pharmacotherapy is widespread. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to determine the possible interactions between herbal medicines and cardiovascular drugs. The Medline database was searched for clinical articles published between January 1996 and February 2003. Forty-three case reports and eight clinical trials were identified. Warfarin was the most common cardiovascular drug involved. It was found to interact with boldo, curbicin, fenugreek, garlic, danshen, devil's claw, don quai, ginkgo, papaya, lycium, mango, PC-SPES (resulting in over-anticoagulation) and with ginseng, green tea, soy and St. John's wort (causing decreased anticoagulant effect). Gum guar, St. John's wort, Siberian ginseng and wheat bran were found to decrease plasma digoxin concentration; aspirin interactions include spontaneous hyphema when associated with ginkgo and increased bioavailability if combined with tamarind. Decreased plasma concentration of simvastatin or lovastatin was observed after co-administration with St. John's wort and wheat bran, respectively. Other adverse events include hypertension after co-administration of ginkgo and a diuretic thiazide, hypokalemia after liquorice and antihypertensives and anticoagulation after phenprocoumon and St. John's wort. Interaction between herbal medicine and cardiovascular drugs is a potentially important safety issue. Patients taking anticoagulants are at the highest risk.\",\n",
       "  \"Recently, interactions of herbal medicines with synthetic drugs came into focus of particular interest. In the past 3 years, more than 50 papers were published regarding interactions between St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.; SJW) and prescription drugs. Co-medication with SJW resulted in decreased plasma concentrations of a number of drugs including amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, indinavir, irinotecan, warfarin, phenprocoumon, alprazolam, dextrometorphane, simvastatin, and oral contraceptives. Sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports indicate that SJW is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4) and/or P-glycoprotein. Recent studies could show that the degree of enzyme induction by SJW correlates strongly with the amount of hyperforin found in the product. Products that do not contain substantial amounts of hyperforin (<1%) have not been shown to produce clinically relevant enzyme induction. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that hyperforin may also contribute to the antidepressant activity of SJW. However, clinical studies using SJW preparations with a low hyperforin amount (<1%) clearly demonstrated the superiority of this plant extract over placebo and its equivalence to imipramine and fluoxetine in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of depression. In the present paper clinical significant SJW interactions are critically evaluated against the background of hyperforin.\",\n",
       "  'Vildagliptin is an orally active, potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as either monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents. Vildagliptin possesses several desirable pharmacokinetic properties that contribute to its lower variability and low potential for drug interaction. Following oral administration, vildagliptin is rapidly and well absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 85%. An approximately dose-proportional increase in exposure to vildagliptin over the dose range of 25-200\\u2009mg has been reported. Food does not have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin, and it can be taken without regard to food. Vildagliptin is minimally bound to plasma proteins (9.3%) and, on the basis of a volume of distribution of 71\\u2009L, it is considered to distribute extensively into extravascular spaces. Renal clearance of vildagliptin (13\\u2009L/h) accounts for 33% of the total body clearance after intravenous administration (41\\u2009L/h). The primary elimination pathway is hydrolysis by multiple tissues/organs. The DPP-4 enzyme contributes to the formation of the major hydrolysis metabolite, LAY151; therefore, vildagliptin is also a substrate of DPP-4. Vildagliptin has a low potential for drug interactions, as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are minimally (<1.6%) involved in the overall metabolism. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have reported the lack of drug interaction with several drugs (metformin, pioglitazone, glyburide, simvastatin, amlodipine, valsartan, ramipril, digoxin and warfarin) that are likely to be frequently co-administered to patients with T2DM. In particular, vildagliptin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone, glyburide, warfarin and simvastatin; therefore, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of a drug that is a substrate for CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP3A4. In the elderly, vildagliptin exposure increases by approximately 30%, which is considered to be mostly attributable to compromised renal function in the elderly population and is not considered to be clinically relevant. Vildagliptin has been demonstrated to be efficacious, safe and well tolerated in elderly patients with T2DM without dose adjustment. In subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, vildagliptin exposure increases by approximately 2-fold; however, the increase in the exposure does not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. The lack of a clear correlation between the increased exposure and the severity of renal impairment is considered to be attributable to the fact that the kidneys contribute to both the excretion and the hydrolysis metabolism of vildagliptin. Hepatic impairment, gender, body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity do not have an influence on the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin. These findings suggest that vildagliptin can be used in a diverse patient population without dose adjustment. Oral administration of vildagliptin to patients with T2DM completely inhibits DPP-4 activity at a variety of doses. The onset of DPP-4 inhibition is rapid, and the duration of DPP-4 inhibition is dose dependent. Vildagliptin is a potent inhibitor of the DPP-4 enzyme, with a concentration required to achieve 50% DPP-4 inhibition (IC(50)) of 4.5\\u2009nmol/L in patients with T2DM. Similar potency of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin has been reported in different ethnic groups, indicating that ethnicity does not affect the pharmacodynamics of vildagliptin. Vildagliptin significantly increases the active glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels by approximately 2- to 3-fold and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels by approximately 5-fold, and significantly suppresses the postprandial glucagon levels in response to a meal or following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in patients with T2DM. Vildagliptin significantly reduces both fasting and postprandial glucose levels over the dose range of 50-100\\u2009mg daily (administered either once daily or twice daily), and there are no substantial additional benefits of doses greater than 50\\u2009mg twice daily. The primary clinical dosing regimen is 50\\u2009mg twice daily as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Vildagliptin increases the insulin levels following an OGTT and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), and the stimulation of insulin secretion is glucose dependent. Vildagliptin has been shown to improve beta-cell function on the basis of pharmacodynamic modelling taking the reduced glucose levels into account. The improvement of beta-cell function by vildagliptin has been confirmed after chronic treatment with vildagliptin for up to 2 years. Reduction of the endogenous glucose production appears to contribute to the glucose-lowering effects. Unlike the GLP-1 receptor agonists, vildagliptin does not affect gastric emptying, and this is consistent with the favourable gastrointestinal safety profile. Vildagliptin improves the sensitivity of the alpha cell to glucose in patients with T2DM by enhancing the alpha-cell responsiveness to both suppressive effects of hyperglycaemia and stimulatory effects of hypoglycaemia. Consistently, a lower incidence of hypoglycaemic events with vildagliptin is reported when it is used as either monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents, such as metformin or insulin, as compared with a sulphonylurea. Numerous long-term clinical trials of up to 2 years have demonstrated that vildagliptin 50\\u2009mg once daily or twice daily is effective, safe and well tolerated in patients with T2DM as either monotherapy or in combination with a variety of other anti-diabetic agents.',\n",
       "  'The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent novel therapeutic approaches in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus; they act on kidneys to decrease the renal threshold for glucose (RTG) and increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Canagliflozin is an orally active, reversible, selective SGLT2 inhibitor. Orally administered canagliflozin is rapidly absorbed achieving peak plasma concentrations in 1-2\\xa0h. Dose-proportional systemic exposure to canagliflozin has been observed over a wide dose range (50-1600\\xa0mg) with an oral bioavailability of 65\\xa0%. Canagliflozin is glucuronidated into two inactive metabolites, M7 and M5 by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 and UGT2B4, respectively. Canagliflozin reaches steady state in 4\\xa0days, and there is minimal accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Approximately 60\\xa0% and 33\\xa0% of the administered dose is excreted in the feces and urine, respectively. The half-life of orally administered canagliflozin 100 or 300\\xa0mg in healthy participants is 10.6 and 13.1\\xa0h, respectively. No clinically relevant differences are observed in canagliflozin exposure with respect to age, race, sex, and body weight. The pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin remains unaffected by mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Systemic exposure to canagliflozin is increased in patients with renal impairment relative to those with normal renal function; however, the efficacy is reduced in patients with renal impairment owing to the reduced filtered glucose load. Canagliflozin did not show clinically relevant drug interactions with metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, oral contraceptives, probenecid, and cyclosporine, while co-administration with rifampin modestly reduced canagliflozin plasma concentrations and thus may necessitate an appropriate monitoring of glycemic control. Canagliflozin increases UGE and suppresses RTG in a dose-dependent manner, thereby lowering the plasma glucose levels and reducing the glycosylated hemoglobin levels through an insulin-independent mechanism of action. The 300-mg dose provides near-maximal effects on RTG throughout the full 24-h dosing interval, whereas the effect of the 100-mg dose on RTG is near-maximal for approximately 12\\xa0h and is modestly attenuated during the overnight period. The observed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus supports a once-daily dosing regimen.',\n",
       "  \"A 67-year-old man receiving a stable maintenance dosage of warfarin experienced an increased international normalized ratio (INR) without bleeding when his atorvastatin therapy was switched to fluvastatin. His warfarin dosage was reduced and his INR stabilized. The fluvastatin was switched back to atorvastatin, and the warfarin dosage was increased to maintain the patient's goal INR. The literature supports a drug interaction between warfarin and fluvastatin due to the strong affinity of fluvastatin for the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6. This interaction has not been seen with atorvastatin. Lovastatin also reportedly has caused increases in INR when coadministered with warfarin. It is unclear whether simvastatin interacts with warfarin, but it may increase INRs slightly or increase serum simvastatin levels. One case report describes an interaction between simvastatin and the anticoagulant acenocoumarol, which resulted in an elevated INR. Pravastatin does not appear to interact with warfarin but has caused an increased INR when combined with the anticoagulant fluindione. Thus, until more definitive data are available, clinicians should monitor the INR closely after starting statin therapy in any patient receiving anticoagulation therapy.\"],\n",
       " [\"To evaluate the quality of studies about drugs and food interactions with warfarin and their clinical relevance. MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases from 1966 to October 1993 using the Medical Subject Headings warfarin, drug interactions, and English only. All articles reporting original data on drug and food interactions with warfarin. Each report, rated independently by at least two investigators (using causality assessment), received a summary score indicating the level of assurance (level 1 = highly probable, level 2 = probable, level 3 = possible, and level 4 = doubtful) that a clinically important interaction had or had not occurred. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a weighted kappa statistic. Of 793 retrieved citations, 120 contained original reports on 186 interactions. The weighted kappa statistic was 0.67, representing substantial agreement. Of 86 different drugs and foods appraised, 43 had level 1 evidence. Of these, 26 drugs and foods did interact with warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was potentiated by 6 antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, isoniazid, metronidazole, and miconazole); 5 cardiac drugs (amiodarone, clofibrate, propafenone, propranolol, and sulfinpyrazone); phenylbutazone; piroxicam; alcohol (only with concomitant liver disease); cimetidine; and omeprazole. Three patients had a hemorrhage at the time of a potentiating interaction (caused by alcohol, isoniazid, and phenylbutazone). Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was inhibited by 3 antibiotics (griseofulvin, rifampin, and nafcillin); 3 drugs active on the central nervous system (barbiturates, carbamazepine, and chlordiazepoxide); cholestyramine; sucralfate; foods high in vitamin K; and large amounts of avocado. Many drugs and foods interact with warfarin, including antibiotics, drugs affecting the central nervous system, and cardiac medications. Many of these drug interactions increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect.\",\n",
       "  'This article reviews the metabolic pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the systemic antifungal agents: the azoles ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, the allylamine terbinafine and the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole. The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.',\n",
       "  'There are 3 main classes of systemic antifungals: the polyene macrolides (e.g. amphotericin B), the azoles (e.g. the imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole and the triazoles itraconazole and fluconazole) and the allylamines (e.g. terbinafine). Other systemic antifungals include griseofulvin and flucytosine. Most drug-drug interactions involving systemic antifungals have negative consequences. The interactions of amphotericin B, flucytosine, griseofulvin, terbinafine and azole antifungals can be divided into the following categories: (i) additive dangerous interactions; (ii) modifications of antifungal kinetics by other drugs; and (iii) modifications of the kinetics of other drugs by antifungals. Amphotericin B and flucytosine mainly interact with other agents pharmacodynamically. Clinically important drug interactions with amphotericin B cause nephrotoxicity, hypokalaemia and blood dyscrasias. The most important drug interaction of flucytosine occurs with myelotoxic agents. Hypokalaemia can precipitate the long QT syndrome, as well as potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias like torsade de pointes. Synergism is likely to occur when either QT interval-modifying drugs (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole) and drugs that induce hypokalaemia (e.g. amphotericin B) are coadministered. Induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes at hepatic and extrahepatic sites are the mechanisms that underlie the most serious pharmacokinetic drug interactions of the azole antifungals. These agents have been shown to notably decrease the catabolism of numerous drugs: histamine H1 receptor antagonists, warfarin, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, digoxin, felodipine, lovastatin, midazolam, triazolam, methylprednisolone, glibenclamide (glyburide), phenytoin, rifabutin, ritonavir, saquinavir, nevirapine and nortriptyline. Non-antifungal drugs like carbamazepine, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), phenytoin and rifampicin (rifampin) can induce the metabolism of azole antifungals. The bioavailability of ketoconazole and itraconazole is also reduced by drugs that increase gastric pH, such as H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and didanosine. Griseofulvin is an enzymatic inducer of coumarin-like drugs and estrogens, whereas terbinafine seems to have a low potential for drug interactions. Despite important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetic drug interactions during the 1990s, at this time they still remain difficult to predict in terms of magnitude in individual patients. This is because of the large interindividual and intraindividual variations in the catalytic activity of those metabolising enzymes that can either be induced or inhibited by various drugs. Notwithstanding these variations, increasing clinical experience is allowing pharmacokinetic interactions to be used to advantage in order to improve the tolerability of some drugs, as recently exemplified by the use of a fixed combination of ketoconazole and cyclosporin.',\n",
       "  \"Consistent with expectations based on human in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 6 days to six human volunteers significantly reduced the cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the warfarin enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data.\",\n",
       "  'The aim of this study was to determine whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between warfarin and orally administered anti-infectives increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in warfarin users. We conducted a nested case-control and case-crossover study using US Medicaid data. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between GI bleeding and prior use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, co-trimoxazole, or fluconazole vs. no exposure and also vs. use of cephalexin, which would not be expected to interact with warfarin. All of the anti-infectives examined were associated with elevated odds ratios (ORs) when compared to no exposure to these drugs. With cephalexin data as the reference, the ORs for co-trimoxazole (OR: 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-2.33) in the prior 6-10 days) and fluconazole (OR: 2.09 (95% CI: 1.34-3.26) in the prior 11-15 days) were significantly elevated. Warfarin users who had received an anti-infective agent showed a substantially increased risk of GI bleeding. However, a drug-drug interaction with warfarin was evident only for co-trimoxazole and fluconazole.',\n",
       "  \"Etravirine (formerly TMC125) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with activity against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant strains of HIV-1. Etravirine has been approved in several countries for use as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy in treatment-experienced patients. In vivo, etravirine is a substrate for, and weak inducer of, the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 and a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Etravirine is also a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. An extensive drug-drug interaction programme in HIV-negative subjects has been carried out to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between etravirine and a variety of non-antiretroviral drugs. Effects of atorvastatin, clarithromycin, methadone, omeprazole, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, ranitidine and sildenafil on the pharmacokinetic disposition of etravirine were of no clinical relevance. Likewise, etravirine had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, methadone, oral contraceptives, paroxetine or voriconazole. No clinically relevant interactions are expected between etravirine and azithromycin or ribavirin, therefore, etravirine can be combined with these agents without dose adjustment. Fluconazole and voriconazole increased etravirine exposure 1.9- and 1.4-fold, respectively, in healthy subjects, however, no increase in the incidence of adverse effects was observed in patients receiving etravirine and fluconazole during clinical trials, therefore, etravirine can be combined with these antifungals although caution is advised. Digoxin plasma exposure was slightly increased when co-administered with etravirine. No dose adjustments of digoxin are needed when used in combination with etravirine, however, it is recommended that digoxin levels should be monitored. Caution should be exercised in combining rifabutin with etravirine in the presence of certain boosted HIV protease inhibitors due to the risk of decreased exposure to etravirine. Although adjustments to the dose of clarithromycin are unnecessary for the treatment of most infections, the use of an alternative macrolide (e.g. azithromycin) is recommended for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex infection since the overall activity of clarithromycin against this pathogen may be altered when co-administered with etravirine. Dosage adjustments based on clinical response are recommended for clopidogrel, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. atorvastatin) and for phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil) because changes in the exposure of these medications in the presence of co-administered etravirine may occur. When co-administered with etravirine, a dose reduction or alternative to diazepam is recommended. When combining etravirine with warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be monitored. Systemic dexamethasone should be co-administered with caution, or an alternative to dexamethasone be found as dexamethasone induces CYP3A4. Caution is also warranted when co-administering etravirine with some antiarrhythmics, calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. ciclosporin) and antidepressants (e.g. citalopram). Co-administration of etravirine with some antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine and phenytoin), rifampicin (rifampin), rifapentine or preparations containing St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is currently not recommended as these are potent inducers of CYP3A and/or CYP2C and may potentially decrease etravirine exposure. Antiepileptics that are less likely to interact based on their known pharmacological properties include gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam and pregabalin. Overall, pharmacokinetic and clinical data show etravirine to be well tolerated and generally safe when given in combination with non-antiretroviral agents, with minimal clinically significant drug interactions and no need for dosage adjustments of etravirine in any of the cases, or of the non-antiretroviral agent in the majority of cases studied.\",\n",
       "  'The results of studies of the effect of fluconazole on cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C9 activity in vivo and in vitro are used to develop an approach to the safe management of the warfarin-fluconazole drug interaction. This approach begins with a determination of an in vitro Ki value (22 microM), which may be used to relate fluconazole plasma concentrations to inhibitory effect on P4502C9 activity and (S)-warfarin half-life. A means for adding fluconazole to a therapeutic regimen of warfarin is proposed that involves a stepped reduction of the warfarin dose over 5 days to a final target daily dose that is determined by the fluconazole dose level. The effect of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability on outcome quality is explored in simulation studies that indicate that a stepped-dose reduction schedule will be superior to a one-time dose reduction. The in vivo K, was found to predict accurately the magnitude of the fluconazole interaction study with another P4502C9 substrate tolbutamide.',\n",
       "  'Because management of type 2 diabetes mellitus usually involves combined pharmacological therapy to obtain adequate glucose control and treatment of concurrent pathologies (especially dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension), drug-drug interactions must be carefully considered with antihyperglycaemic drugs. Additive glucose-lowering effects have been extensively reported when combining sulphonylureas (or the new insulin secretagogues, meglitinide derivatives, i.e. nateglinide and repaglinide) with metformin, sulphonylureas (or meglitinide derivatives) with thiazolidinediones (also called glitazones) and the biguanide compound metformin with thiazolidinediones. Interest in combining alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with either sulphonylureas (or meglitinide derivatives), metformin or thiazolidinediones has also been demonstrated. These combinations result in lower glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting glucose and postprandial glucose levels than with either monotherapy. Even if modest pharmacokinetic interferences have been reported with some combinations, they do not appear to have important clinical consequences. No significant adverse effects, except a higher risk of hypoglycaemic episodes that may be attributed to better glycaemic control, occur with any combination. Challenging the classical dual therapy with sulphonylurea plus metformin, there is a recent trend to use alternative dual combinations (sulphonylurea plus thiazolidinedione or metformin plus thiazolidinedione). In addition, triple therapy with the addition of a thiazolidinedione to the metformin-sulphonylurea combination has been recently evaluated and allows glucose targets to be reached before insulin therapy is considered. This triple therapy appears to be safe, with no deleterious drug-drug interactions being reported so far.Potential interferences may also occur between glucose-lowering agents and other drugs, and such drug-drug interactions may have important clinical implications. Relevant pharmacological agents are those that are widely coadministered in diabetic patients (e.g. lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensive agents); those that have a narrow efficacy/toxicity ratio (e.g. digoxin, warfarin); or those that are known to induce (rifampicin [rifampin]) or inhibit (fluconazole) the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Metformin is currently a key compound in the pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes, used either alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemics. There are no clinically relevant metabolic interactions with metformin, because this compound is not metabolised and does not inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. In contrast, sulphonylureas, meglitinide derivatives and thiazolidinediones are extensively metabolised in the liver via the CYP system and thus, may be subject to drug-drug metabolic interactions. Many HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are also metabolised via the CYP system. Even if modest pharmacokinetic interactions may occur, it is not clear whether drug-drug interactions between oral antihyperglycaemic agents and statins may have clinical consequences regarding both efficacy and safety. In contrast, a marked pharmacokinetic interference has been reported between gemfibrozil and repaglinide and, to a lesser extent, between gemfibrozil and rosiglitazone. This leads to a drastic increase in plasma concentrations of each antihyperglycaemic agent when they are coadministered with the fibric acid derivative, and an increased risk of adverse effects. Some antihypertensive agents may favour hypoglycaemic episodes when co-prescribed with sulphonylureas or meglitinide derivatives, especially ACE inhibitors, but this effect seems to result from a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction rather than from a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction. No, or only modest, interferences have been described with glucose-lowering agents and other pharmacological compounds such as digoxin or warfarin. The effects of inducers or inhibitors of CYP isoenzymes on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the glucose-lowering agents of each pharmacological class has been tested. Significantly increased (with CYP inhibitors) or decreased (with CYP inducers) plasma levels of sulphonylureas, meglitinide derivatives and thiazolidinediones have been reported in healthy volunteers, and these pharmacokinetic changes may lead to enhanced or reduced glucose-lowering action, and thus hypoglycaemia or worsening of metabolic control, respectively. In addition, some case reports have evidenced potential drug-drug interactions with various antihyperglycaemic agents that are usually associated with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia.',\n",
       "  'To assess the frequency of potential azole-drug interactions and consequences of interactions between fluconazole and other drugs in routine inpatient care. We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients treated for systemic fungal infections with an oral or intravenous azole medication between July 1997 and June 2001 in a tertiary care hospital. We recorded the concomitant use of medications known to interact with azole antifungals and measured the frequency of potential azole drug interactions, which we considered to be present when both drugs were given together. We then performed a chart review on a random sample of admissions in which patients were exposed to a potential moderate or major drug interaction with fluconazole. The list of azole-interacting medications and the severity of interaction were derived from the DRUGDEX System and Drug Interaction Facts. Among the 4,185 admissions in which azole agents (fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole) were given, 2,941 (70.3%) admissions experienced potential azole-drug interactions, which included 2,716 (92.3%) admissions experiencing potential fluconazole interactions. The most frequent interactions with potential moderate to major severity were co-administration of fluconazole with prednisone (25.3%), midazolam (17.5%), warfarin (14.7%), methylprednisolone (14.1%), cyclosporine (10.7%) and nifedipine (10.1%). Charts were reviewed for 199 admissions in which patients were exposed to potential fluconazole drug interactions. While four adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by fluconazole were found, none was felt to be caused by a drug-drug interaction (DDI), although in one instance fluconazole may have contributed. Potential fluconazole drug interactions were very frequent among hospitalized patients on systemic azole antifungal therapy, but they had few apparent clinical consequences.',\n",
       "  'Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Although irbesartan does not require biotransformation for its pharmacological activity, it does undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isoenzyme and negligible metabolism by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The long term treatment of patients with hypertension is generally required for effective management of the disease, and the use of concurrent medications is usually inevitable. This paper reviews the drug and food interaction trials involving irbesartan that have been conducted to date. Based on the available literature, no significant interactions have been identified between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, simvastatin, tolbutamide, warfarin, magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, digoxin or food. Fluconazole did increase the steady-state peak plasma concentration (by 19%) and area under the concentration-time curve (by 63%) of irbesartan, but these increases are not likely to be clinically significant. In summary, irbesartan has demonstrated minimal potential for drug or food interactions in trials conducted to date.'],\n",
       " ['Paritaprevir (administered with ritonavir, PTV/r), ombitasvir (OBV), and dasabuvir (DSV) are direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Thirteen studies were conducted to characterize drug-drug interactions for the 3D regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV and various medications in healthy volunteers to inform dosing recommendations in HCV-infected patients. Mechanism-based drug-drug interactions were evaluated for gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, carbamazepine, warfarin, omeprazole, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin. Drug-drug interactions with medications commonly used in HCV-infected patients were evaluated for amlodipine, furosemide, alprazolam, zolpidem, duloxetine, escitalopram, methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone, and oral contraceptives. Ratios of geometric means with 90% confidence intervals for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were used to determine the magnitude of interaction. Coadministration with the 3D regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV resulted in a <2-fold change in mean Cmax and AUC for most medications and the DAAs, indicating minimal to modest interactions. Carbamazepine decreased PTV, ritonavir, and DSV exposures substantially, while gemfibrozil increased DSV exposures substantially. Although coadministration with ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives resulted in elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, coadministration with a progestin-only contraceptive did not. The majority of medications can be coadministered with the 3D regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV without dose adjustment, or with clinical monitoring or dose adjustment. Although no dose adjustment is necessary for the 3D regimen when coadministered with 17 of the 20 medications, coadministration with gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, or ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives is contraindicated.',\n",
       "  'The binding of erythromycin base (EB) to human plasma (HP) proteins was measured by equilibrium dialysis using EB-14C at approximately 0.5 microgram/ml in the plasma phase, expected therapeutic concentration. EB was 64.5 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- S.D.) bound to HP. The percentage of bound EB was linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and a1 acid glycoprotein (a1AGP) bound 8.7 +/- 1.6 and 54.5 +/- 0.6%, respectively, of the drug. No binding of EB to HDL or LDL or human gamma globulins was found. For HSA separately, EB binding followed a non-saturable phenomenon with n\\'K\\' = 100 +/- 5, while for a1AGP the binding was following a saturable phenomenon with n\" = 1 +/- 0.045, K\" = 35,000 +/- 5000 M-1. It can then be shown that, in human plasma, EB is only bound to those two proteins: firstly by computing the binding of EB to HSA and a1AGP with the previously indicated parameters, and secondly by measuring the binding of EB to HP. The computed curve fairly fits to the measured one. Interaction of EB with HP involved hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen forces. Lower than 37 degrees C temperatures decreased EB binding. Significant competitive binding was demonstrated between EB and acetylsalicylic acid, furosemide, phenylbutazone, warfarin and bilirubin.',\n",
       "  'This paper describes the protein binding of cefazolin to human serum and to human serum albumin (HSA) using equilibrium dialysis. The drug is exclusively bound to HSA with a moderate affinity, Ka = 16,600 +/- 1600 M-1, and one saturable binding site, n = 0.73 +/- 0.02. Moreover cefazolin shows a dose-dependent binding leading a possible increase of the free fraction (when its total concentration increases). This antibiotic is displaced by free fatty acids (FFA) and bilirubin. Cefazolin binding to human serum and human serum albumin (HSA) was studied in presence of acidic drugs. At low concentrations clofibric acid and phenylbutazone both exhibiting high affinity for HSA displace strongly cefazolin. Valproic and salicylic acids, sulfamethoxazole, cefoperazone which have approximately the same affinity as cefazolin, must be used at higher concentrations to displace this antibiotic. A particular phenomenon was observed with cefazolin on HSA when associated with furosemide. A low concentration (5-25 microM) of this drug induces a positive cooperativity of binding between cefazolin and HSA. But at a molar ratio of furosemide to albumin greater than one, such cooperative interaction disappears and a competitive inhibition of cefazolin binding occurs. For all drugs studied, a competitive inhibition was found except for tryptophan. Finally, it is concluded that cefazolin shares the warfarin binding site on HSA.',\n",
       "  'The influence of glycosylation on the drug binding of human serum albumin (HSA) was studied using HSA containing different amounts and degrees of glycosylated HSA. The drugs used were furosemide, naproxen, procaine, phenylbutazone, salicylic acid, sulphamethoxazole, tolbutamide and warfarin. The drug-HSA parameters (lognK) were measured by the ultrafiltration method, frontal analysis and a modified Hummel-Dreyer method. The modified Hummel-Dreyer method was the simplest method with high precision and required the smallest amounts of proteins. The lognK values were well correlated with the octanol-water partition coefficients; the correlation coefficients were over 0.95. The results suggested that hydrophobic interaction is the predominant force for the drug binding. The early stage of glycosylation of HSA did not significantly affect the drug-binding capacity. Generally, the binding affinity of HSA decreased, perhaps due to a conformational change or steric hindrance (except naproxen) when further glycosylation occurred.',\n",
       "  'Drug interactions are a significant clinical concern, particularly in patients with conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, in whom coadministration of multiple drugs is common. Nebivolol is a selective β(1)-blocker with vasodilatory properties approved for the treatment of hypertension. Drug-drug interactions were investigated when nebivolol was coadministered to subjects classified as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers who were receiving other drugs commonly administered to patients with hypertension or compounds metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. There were no drug-drug interactions when nebivolol was coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, ramipril, losartan, digoxin, or warfarin. Coadministration with fluoxetine (also metabolized by CYP2D6) in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers impeded the apparent clearance of nebivolol. The authors conclude that nebivolol is safe and well tolerated regardless of genotype and type of medication coadministered.',\n",
       "  'Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a highly toxic mycotoxin found worldwide in cereals, foods, animal feeds and different drinks. Based on previous studies, OTA is one of the major causes of the chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy known as Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and exerts several other adverse effects shown by cell and/or animal models. It is a well-known fact that OTA binds to various albumins with very high affinity. Recently, a few studies suggested that reducing the bound fraction of OTA might reduce its toxicity. Hypothetically, certain drugs can be effective competitors displacing OTA from its albumin complex. Therefore, we examined 13 different drug molecules to determine their competing abilities to displace OTA from human serum albumin (HSA). Competitors and ineffective chemicals were identified with a steady-state fluorescence polarization-based method. After characterization the competitive abilities of individual drugs, drug pairs were formed and their displacing activity were tested in OTA-HSA system. Indometacin, phenylbutazone, warfarin and furosemide showed the highest competing capacity but ibuprofen, glipizide and simvastatin represented detectable interaction too. Investigations of drug pairs raised the possibility of the presence of diverse binding sites of competing drugs. Apart from the chemical information obtained in our model, this explorative research might initiate future designs for epidemiologic studies to gain further in vivo evidence of long-term (potentially protective) effects of competing drugs administered to human patients.',\n",
       "  'The methacrylate-copolymer Eudragit EPO (EPO) has raised interest in solubility enhancement of anionic drugs. Effects on aqueous drug solubility at rather low polymer concentrations are barely known despite their importance upon dissolution and dilution of oral dosage forms. We provide evidence for substantial enhancement (factor 4-230) of aqueous solubility of poorly water-soluble anionic drugs induced by low (0.1-5% (w/w)) concentration of EPO for a panel of seven acidic crystalline drugs. Diffusion data (determined by <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) indicate that the solubility increasing effect monitored by quantitative ultraperformance liquid chromatography was caused primarily by molecular API polymer interactions in the bulk liquid phase. Residual solid API remained unaltered as tested by X-ray powder diffraction. The solubility enhancement (SE) revealed a significant rank correlation (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = -0.83) with rDiff<sub>API</sub>, where SE and rDiff<sub>API</sub> are defined ratios of solubility and diffusion coefficient in the presence and absence of EPO. SE decreased in the order of indomethacin, mefenamic acid, warfarin, piroxicam, furosemide, bezafibrate, and tolbutamide. The solubilizing effect was attributed to both ionic and hydrophobic interactions between drugs and EPO. The excellent solubilizing properties of EPO are highly promising for pharmaceutical development, and the data set provides first steps toward an understanding of drug-excipient interaction mechanisms.',\n",

However, reports of DDI between these groups of drugs are few. The study aims to identify the potential DDI among hospitalized cardiac patients. Furthermore, we assessed the possible risk factors associated with these interactions. The Type of study prospective observational study was conducted from May 2012 to August 2012 among hospitalized cardiac patients. Cardiac patients who were taking at least two drugs and who had a hospital stay of at least 24 h were enrolled. The medications of the patients were analyzed for possible interactions using the standard drug interaction database - Micromedex -2 (Thomson Reuters) × 2.0. From a total of 150 enrolled patients, at least one interacting drug combination was identified among 32 patients. The incidence of potential DDI was 21.3%. A total of 48 potentially hazardous drug interactions were identified. Atorvastatin/azithromycin (10.4%), enalapril/metformin (10.4%), enalapril/potassium chloride (10.4%), atorvastatin/clarithromycin (8.3%) and furosemide/gentamicin (6.3%) were the most common interacting pairs. Drugs most commonly involved were atorvastatin, enalapril, digoxin, furosemide, clopidogrel and warfarin. Majority of interactions were of moderate severity (62.5%) and pharmacokinetic (58.3%) in nature. Increased number of medicines, prolonged hospital stays and comorbid conditions were the risk factors found associated with the potential DDI. This study highlighted the need of intense monitoring of patients who have identified risk factors to help detect and prevent them from serious health hazards associated with drug interactions.',\n",
       "  'The Cu-PTSM (pyruvaldehyde bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II)) and Cu-ATSM (diacetyl bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II)) radiopharmaceuticals exhibit strong, species-dependent binding to human serum albumin (HSA), while Cu-ETS (ethylglyoxal bis(thiosemicarbazonato)copper(II)) appears to only exhibit nonspecific binding to human and animal serum albumins. This study examines the structural basis for HSA binding of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM via competition with drugs having known albumin binding sites. Warfarin, furosemide, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, benzylpenicillin, and cephmandole were added to HSA solutions at drug:HSA mole ratios from 0 to 8:1, followed by quantification of radiopharmaceutical binding to HSA by ultrafiltration. Warfarin, a site IIA drug, progressively displaced both [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM from HSA. At 8:1 warfarin:HSA mole ratios, free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM levels increased 300-500%. This was in contrast to solutions containing ibuprofen, a site IIIA drug; no increase in free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM or [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM was observed except at high ibuprofen:HSA ratios, where secondary ibuprofen binding to the IIA site may cause modest radiopharmaceutical displacement. By contrast, and consistent with earlier findings suggesting Cu-ETS exhibits only nonspecific associations, [(64)Cu]Cu-ETS binding to HSA was unaffected by the addition of drugs that bind in either site. We conclude that the species-dependence of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM albumin binding arises from interaction(s) with the IIA site of HSA.',\n",
       "  'The novel iron-based phosphate binder sucroferric oxyhydroxide is being investigated for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Patients with chronic kidney disease often have multiple comorbidities that may necessitate the daily use of several types of medication. Therefore, the potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and selected drugs commonly taken by dialysis patients were investigated. Five Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover studies in healthy volunteers investigated the effect of a single dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide 1 g (based on iron content) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan 100 mg, furosemide 40 mg, omeprazole 40 mg, digoxin 0.5 mg and warfarin 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters [including area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-∞) and from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24)] for these drugs were determined: alone in the presence of food; with sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the presence of food; 2 h after food and sucroferric oxyhydroxide administration. Systemic exposure based on AUC0-∞ for all drugs, and AUC0-24 for all drugs except omeprazole (for which AUC 0-8 h was measured), was unaffected to a clinically significant extent by the presence of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, irrespective of whether sucroferric oxyhydroxide was administered with the drug or 2 h earlier. There is a low risk of drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide, digoxin and warfarin. There is also a low risk of drug-drug interaction with omeprazole (based on AUC0-∞ values). Therefore, sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be administered concomitantly without the need to adjust the dosage regimens of these drugs.'],\n",
       " ['This article reviews the metabolic pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the systemic antifungal agents: the azoles ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, the allylamine terbinafine and the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole. The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. On the basis of the existing in vitro and in vivo data, drug interactions of terbinafine with substrates of other CYP isoforms are unlikely.',\n",
       "  \"* Numerous cocktails using concurrent administration of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-selective probe drugs have been reported to investigate drug-drug interactions in vivo. * This approach has several advantages: characterize the inhibitory or induction potential of compounds in development toward the CYP enzymes identified in vitro in an in vivo situation, assess several enzymes in the same trial, and have complete in vivo information about potential CYP-based drug interactions. * This study describes a new cocktail containing five probe drugs that has never been published. * This cocktail can be used to test the effects of a new chemical entity on multiple CYP isoforms in a single clinical study: CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A (midazolam) and was designed to overcome potential liabilities of other reported cocktails. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selective substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol) and CYP3A (midazolam) when administered orally and concurrently as a cocktail relative to the drugs administered alone. This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, six-treatment six-period six-sequence William's design study with a wash-out of 7 or 14 days. Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC. There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25. The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo.\",\n",
       "  'At present, there are two H2-receptor antagonists available for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease - cimetidine and ranitidine. Cimetidine is well known to interact with a number of concurrently administered drugs. Like cimetidine, ranitidine binds to cytochrome P-450 in the liver where it appears to exert an inhibitory effect, but to a lesser extent than cimetidine. Both H2-receptor antagonists may also reduce hepatic blood flow. Several drugs which are known to interact with cimetidine have been found not to interact significantly with ranitidine, including propranolol, lignocaine, phenytoin and diazepam. However, significant pharmacokinetic interactions between ranitidine and several other drugs have been established. These interactions may be attributed variously to an effect of ranitidine on hepatic metabolism or to an effect on the absorption of concomitantly administered drugs. For example, the bioavailability of midazolam is significantly increased due to the influence of ranitidine on gastric pH and thus on absorption of midazolam, leading to an increased soporific effect of this benzodiazepine; an effect of ranitidine on oxidative liver metabolism also appears to be a contributory factor in this interaction. Conversely, ranitidine distinctly reduced protein-bound cobalamin absorption from a mean of 7.66% prior to ranitidine administration to 0.84% during treatment with ranitidine 300 mg daily. A significant pharmacokinetic interaction has also been demonstrated between ranitidine and procainamide: the AUC of procainamide increased and the renal clearance fell significantly from a mean of 378 to 309 ml/min with ranitidine co-administration. However, this interaction is due to a different mechanism. In this case, ranitidine appears to compete with procainamide for the common renal proximal tubular secretion site. The reported interactions of ranitidine with warfarin, metoprolol, nifedipine, theophylline and fentanyl appear to be due to inhibition of cytochrome P-450. In a clinical study, warfarin clearance was significantly reduced from 66.7 to 48.7 ml/min by ranitidine, and by cimetidine to 42.9 ml/min. Similarly, the elimination half-lives of metoprolol and nifedipine were distinctly prolonged and the AUCs significantly increased by ranitidine. However, the latter pharmacokinetic interactions appear unlikely to be of clinical significance since the clinical effects of metoprolol and nifedipine were unaffected by ranitidine treatment. In therapeutic concentrations, ranitidine inhibited the disappearance of fentanyl from an in vitro microsomal preparation, indicating that it inhibits microsomal drug metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",
       "  'This review summarizes the results of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies in man with pantoprazole, a new, selective proton pump inhibitor. Various mechanisms have to be considered as causes for potential drug-drug interactions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring, the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, via either induction or inhibition. With the increasing use of PPIs, their interaction potential gains therapeutic importance as was the case with the first and second generation of H2-blockers (cimetidine and ranitidine, respectively). The enhanced selectivity of pantoprazole to the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase characterizes the new PPI generation. In contrast to omeprazole, pantoprazole has a low potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 system in man. In the drug interaction studies conducted so far, substrates for all relevant cytochrome P450 families involved in the metabolism of drugs in man were investigated. Pantoprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glibenclamide, a hormonal contraceptive (combination of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin in man.

The pharmacokinetics of five CYP450 substrates given orally (midazolam, omeprazole, S-warfarin, caffeine, and metoprolol, metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6, respectively) were evaluated before and 28 days after initiation of dupilumab treatment (subcutaneous 300\\u2009mg weekly) in 14 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates, provided substantial clinical benefit, and was generally well tolerated. Only one serious adverse event was reported, an episode of systemic inflammatory response syndrome that resolved after treatment was discontinued. In summary, blockade of IL-4/IL-13 signaling in patients with type 2 inflammation does not appear to significantly affect CYP450 enzyme activities; the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis patients is unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates.',\n",
       "  \"Community pharmacists are well positioned to identify and resolve medication related problems associated with chronic medication use during prescription dispensing, a process referred to as medication monitoring. Pharmacists need feedback about patient medication experiences to engage in effective monitoring, but the pharmacist's decision making process for when to ask questions to solicit this information from patients has not been established. Identify significant factors contributing to a community pharmacist's likelihood to ask medication monitoring questions at the time of refill. A factorial survey approach was used to test the effect of several pharmacist, patient, environment, drug, and past interaction factors (the domains of the Health Collaboration Model) on a pharmacist's self-reported likelihood to ask non-adherence, side effect, and effectiveness monitoring questions for 5 randomly populated refill prescription dispensing vignettes. Surveys containing the vignettes, demographic items, and a new medication monitoring attitude measure were mailed to 599 community pharmacists. Hierarchical linear regression was used to test the independent effects of the vignette and pharmacist factors. There were 254 (42.4%) returned and usable surveys. The hierarchical linear regression models showed that adherence questioning was driven more by the vignette characteristics whereas side effect and effectiveness questioning were more driven by the pharmacist. Overall, warfarin and hydrocodone were seen as more question-worthy than fluoxetine or metoprolol. The number of additional persons waiting in the pharmacy decreased, and more days late increased the likelihood of asking the three monitoring questions. An exception was hydrocodone where early fills prompted question asking. For side effect and effectiveness questioning, being short-staffed and the prescription previously being filled more times decreased question asking likelihood. Factorial surveys are a useful approach to independently measuring the impact of respondent and contextual variables on pharmacist judgments. Reactions to the vignettes demonstrated that multiple factors go into a pharmacist's mental model when deciding to ask a question at the time of refill. The lateness of a refill prescription was a significant cue to question asking. Pharmacies can ensure late refill information is reaching pharmacists as a means to increase in medication monitoring. Pharmacies also can design work environments and workflows conducive to question asking and prompt pharmacists to address potentially under-discussed medications.\",\n",

The pDDIs with warfarin were identified using the interaction screening program Drug-Reax, Micromedex Healthcare Series 1.0. Two hundred and two inpatients were monitored. The mean of 10 different drugs was prescribed for each patient (SD = 3.6). At least 1 major or moderate pDDIs with warfarin per patient was observed, the mean was 3.6 (SD = 1.6). The most common pDDIs with warfarin involved in the increase of anticoagulation effect were enoxaparin (32.2%), simvastatin (27.6%), omeprazole (22.5%), and tramadol (21.5%). For 32 patients (15.8%), interventions were rejected, and they had a higher risk (relative risk= 2.17; 95% confidence interval 1.10-4.27) for abnormal test results (INR > 5). Multivariate analysis showed that age, length of hospital stay, exposure to ≥4 major or moderate pDDIs, and refusal of pharmacist recommendations contribute significantly to the patient's INR result >5. Consequently, the risk of bleeding is increased. Major and moderate pDDIs with warfarin are very common in inpatients and are associated with INR results outside the therapeutic range.

Drug-drug interactions of 257 antineoplastic and supportive care drugs with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), warfarin, enoxaparin, or fondaparinux were categorized as no clinically significant expected DDI, potentially weak DDI, potentially clinically significant DDI, and recommendation against coadministration. Logistic regression models were performed to analyze the association between the dependent variable potentially clinically significant interaction/recommendation against coadministration and the mechanisms of DDI. Of the 1799 associations, 84.4% were absence of DDI, 3.6% potentially weak DDI, 10.2% potentially clinically relevant DDI, and 2.0% recommendation against coadministration. Warfarin has higher DDI potential than other anticoagulants. Enoxaparin and fondaparinux have fewer DDI than others. There was no difference between DOACs.

The result of ceftriaxone use evaluation showed that majority (<i>n</i>\\u2009=\\u2009190, 70.1%) were found to be inappropriate.

       " ['Drug-related problems (DRPs) can reduce the potential clinical benefits of treatment with medicines and waste valuable resources. No previous studies were published to examine the nature and frequency of drug related problems among hospitalized patients in Palestinian hospitals. Prospective observational study was conducted to report and record the natural and frequency of drug related problems in two general hospitals. The study included 212 patients, 54.4 % female, with a mean age 62.2 (±10.6 SD). 88% of the patients were reported with one or more DRPs, with an average of 1.9 DRPs per patient were found. The most prevalent DRP was incorrect dosing regimen which was represented by (22.2%), followed by drug-drug interaction (19.4%), drugs need laboratory tests (15.2%). Ceftriaxone, warfarin, enoxapirin and dogixin were the drugs causing most frequent DRPs. The drug groups causing most DRPs were anti-infective agents, anti-thrombotic agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Once discovered, the majority of DRPs (71.6%) were accepted by the physicians and solved immediately, while 11.5 % of pharmacist advice was not approved. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the number of medications (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.31-3.76) and the number of medical conditions (RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.11-3.13) independently predicted the number of DRPs. DRPs in general hospitals are frequent, serious and predictable. Most of the problems identified as DRPs by the pharmacists were accepted by the physicians and solved. Pharmacists in the hospital setting are well suited to identify and resolve DRPs.',\n",
       "  \"Ceftriaxone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics due to its availability, wide spectrum of activity and low toxicity. However, irrational use of ceftriaxone is one of the current issues in most countries, especially developing ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate ceftriaxone utilization in different wards of Ras-Desta Memorial General Hospital (RDMGH) in Ethiopia. An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 1,079 patients who were admitted to RDMGH from May 2017 to April 2018. A structured data abstraction format was used to collect data from patients' medical chart. Micromedex® drug interaction checker was used to identify significant drug-drug interactions, and national and international guidelines were used to evaluate the appropriateness of ceftriaxone use. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. Among the 1,079 patients enrolled, ceftriaxone was utilized by 601 (55.7%) patients, and these patients were considered for evaluation of appropriateness and subsequent analysis. Among 601 patients, ceftriaxone was used for therapeutic purpose in 362 (60.2%) patients; of which, 359 (99.2%) were for empiric therapy and the rest 239 (39.8%) were for prophylaxis. In the majority of the patients, the dose of ceftriaxone was 2g/day 472 (78.6%) and for a duration of 2-7 days 409 (68.1%). Inappropriate use of ceftriaxone was observed among 237 (39.4%) patients with regard to indication, dose/frequency and duration. About half (49.3%) of the deviation from the guidelines was observed from surgical and gynecologic/obstetrics wards. Among the co-prescribed medications with ceftriaxone, ringer lactate, warfarin and heparin were found to have a significant drug-drug interaction. This study revealed that inappropriate use of ceftriaxone was high in RDMGH. This may increase the emergence of resistant pathogens which may lead to treatment failure and increase cost of therapy. Therefore, adherence to current evidence-based guidelines is recommended.\",\n",
       "  'Drug use evaluation is a method of obtaining information to identify problems related to drug use and if properly developed, a means of correcting the problems. Ceftriaxone is among the most commonly utilized cephalosporins.

This study is, therefore, designed to evaluate the appropriateness of ceftriaxone utilization in government hospitals in Harar town. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in four government hospitals of Harar town by reviewing the medical records of 271 patients who received ceftriaxone from 1 January to 31 December 2016.

       " ['Coumarin derivatives combine 3 unfavorable properties which make them prone to potentially life threatening drug-drug interactions: (i) high protein binding; (ii) cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism; and (iii) a narrow therapeutic range. An entire list of drugs which are supposed to interact with coumarins (mostly with warfarin) comprises about 250 different compounds. Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of coadministration during acute cardiac events. Both drugs are shown to enhance the activated partial thromboplastin time response to heparin.',\n",
       "  'Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are the standards of anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing arthroplasty and abdominal surgery. However, LMWHs are so far only administered by parenteral route. Thus, they are usually replaced by oral warfarin for outpatient therapy. Since warfarin has a slow onset and high incidence of drug-drug interaction, there is a great need for the development of an oral LMWH formulation. LMWH (tinzaparin)-loaded nanoparticles prepared with a blend of a polyester and a polycationic polymethacrylate by the double emulsion method were administered orally in fasted rabbits. The plasma tinzaparin concentration was measured by a chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay. After oral administration of two doses of tinzaparin-loaded nanoparticles (200 and 600 anti-Xa U/kg), the oral absorption was observed between 4 and 10 or 12 h, with a delayed onset of action ranging from 3 to 4 h. Mean absolute bioavailabilities were 51% and 59% for the two tested doses. We now report that the encapsulation of tinzaparin into nanoparticles is likely to contribute to its oral efficacy with an anticoagulant effect prolonged up to 8 h.',\n",
       "  'Thienopyridines are inactive prodrugs that are converted in vivo to active metabolites, which irreversibly bind to and inactivate platelet P2Y(12) receptors, and inhibit platelet activation and aggregation. Prasugrel is a third-generation thienopyridine, recently approved for prevention of thrombotic cardiovascular complications in patients with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Prasugrel is converted to its active metabolite (Pras-AM; compound R-138727) in two sequential steps: (i) rapid and complete hydrolysis by intestinal human carboxylesterase-2 to form a thiolactone intermediate; and (ii) oxidation of the thiolactone by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the gut and/or the liver. CYP3A and CYP2B6 are the primary CYPs contributing to Pras-AM formation, with smaller contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Prasugrel is rapidly absorbed and metabolized, with Pras-AM plasma concentrations peaking at about 0.5 hours after oral administration; this helps to account for the rapid onset of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) achieved by prasugrel. In the clinical pharmacology programme for prasugrel, bodyweight had the greatest effect of all covariates that were tested. In the phase III TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, the mean exposure to Pras-AM was 42% greater in patients weighing < 60 kg than in patients with the study population median bodyweight of 85 kg. In a pharmacodynamic meta-analysis of data from healthy subjects a decrease of 1 kg in bodyweight was associated with an increase in IPA of approximately 0.26 percentage points (p < 0.0001). Pras-AM exposure was greater in subjects aged ≥ 75 years, but exposure differences were not as large as those for bodyweight. Pras-AM exposure was greater in Asians than in Caucasians, but this appeared to result from a disproportionately greater exposure difference in Asian subjects with low bodyweight. Sex and allelic variation in CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, 3A4 and 3A5 appeared to have no clinically relevant effect on Pras-AM exposure or IPA. Consistent with the lack of association between genetic status and these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results in healthy subjects, no significant association was detected between these allelic variants and the composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Studies in renally impaired subjects and subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment have indicated that dose adjustment is not required in these patient populations. Prasugrel has few clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Potent CYP3A inhibitors, gastric acid suppressants and food have been shown to reduce the rate of formation of Pras-AM but not its overall exposure. This pharmacokinetic effect reduced the rate of onset of IPA after a loading dose but did not affect the peak IPA after a loading dose or the IPA during maintenance dosing. Potent induction of CYP3A, as well as smoking--which induces CYP1A2--did not affect Pras-AM exposure or IPA. Prior treatment with clopidogrel did not influence tolerability to prasugrel and did not appear to alter IPA during prasugrel treatment. Prasugrel did not affect the activities of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or P-glycoprotein, but it weakly inhibited CYP2B6. The inhibition of CYP2B6 is potentially clinically significant only for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window and have CYP2B6 as the primary elimination pathway. No interaction was detected between prasugrel and heparin. Although prasugrel did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics, prasugrel and warfarin should not be used together, because of an increased bleeding risk associated with their concomitant use.',\n",
       "  \"Drug interactions resulting in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major health problem both for individuals and the community. Despite this, limited information is reported in the literature on the drug interaction categories responsible for causing ADRs. In the study reported here, we investigated the drug combinations most frequently co-reported as interacting in the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database, VigiBase, and categorised these according to the drug interaction mechanism. Reports in which drug combinations were co-reported as interacting in at least 20 reports in VigiBase during the past 20 years were included in the study. Each drug combination was reviewed in the literature to identify the mechanism of interaction and subsequently classified as pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic reaction. Report characteristics were also analysed. A total of 3766 case reports of drug interactions from 47 countries were identified. Of the 123 different drug combinations reported, 113 were described in the literature to interact. The mechanism of the drug interaction was categorised as pharmacodynamic (46 combinations; 41%), pharmacokinetic (28; 25%), a combination of both types (18; 16%) and unidentified (21; 19%). Pharmacodynamic drug interactions primarily concerned pharmacological additive effects, whereas enzyme inhibition was the most frequent pharmacokinetic interaction. The combinations reviewed primarily implicated drugs such as warfarin, heparin, carbamazepine and digoxin. Drug interactions reported in globally collected ADR reports cover both pharmacodynamic, specifically additive pharmacological effects, and pharmacokinetic mechanisms primarily accredited to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. These ADR reports often concern serious threats to patients' safety and are particularly related to the use of high risk drugs such as warfarin and heparin.\",\n",
       "  'Tinzaparin, a sodium salt of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) produced via heparinase digestion, is used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism in conjunction with warfarin for the prevention of DVT in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, and as an anticoagulant in hemodialysis circuits. Its average molecular weight ranges between 5500 and 7500 daltons (Da); the percentage of chains with molecular weight lower than 2000 Da is not more than 10% in the marketed tinzaparin formulation. While this fraction is generally considered pharmacologically inactive, this has never been evaluated in vivo. The importance of the < 2000 Da fraction on the anticoagulant pharmacodynamics of tinzaparin assessed by anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity was studied in a two-way crossover trial. In this trial, 30 healthy volunteers received a single 175 IU/kg subcutaneous administration of tinzaparin containing approximately 3.5% of the < 2000 Da fraction and a tinzaparin-like LMWH containing 18.3% of the < 2000 Da fraction. The anti-Xa/anti-IIa ratios of the drug substances were comparable at 1.5 and 1.7 for tinzaparin and the tinzaparin-like LMWH, respectively. Both formulations were safe and well tolerated. Mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity (A(max)) was approximately 0.818 IU/ml at 4 h following tinzaparin injection. Mean maximum plasma anti-IIa activity was 0.308 IU/ml at 5 h postdose. Intersubject variation was lower (< 18% for both anti-Xa and anti-IIa metrics) than in previous fixed-dose administration studies. There was no correlation between anti-Xa or anti-IIa AUC or A(max) and bodyweight in the present study supporting the weight-adjusted dosing regimen. Individual anti-Xa and anti-IIa profiles following the single 175 IU/kg subcutaneous administration of the tinzaparin-like LMWH were similar to that obtained with tinzaparin. Based on average equivalence criteria, the two LMWH preparations were determined to be bioequivalent using either anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity as biomarkers. The calculated intrasubject variabilities were low (< 14% for anti-Xa activity and < 18% for anti-IIa activity) yielding little evidence for a significant Subject x Formulation interaction. In summary, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity following a single subcutaneous administration of tinzaparin 175 IU/kg to healthy volunteers yielded activity consistent with targeted therapeutic levels derived from previous trials in adult DVT patients. Weight-based dosing for the treatment of DVT appears rational based on the reduction in anti-Xa and anti-IIa variability consistent with the recommendation derived from earlier fixed-dose pharmacokinetic studies. Furthermore, differences in the percentage of molecules in the < 2000 Da molecular weight fraction of tinzaparin do not translate into differences in anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity in vivo.',\n",
       "  'Knowledge about drug-drug interactions commonly arises from preclinical trials, from adverse drug reports, or based on knowledge of mechanisms of action. Our aim was to investigate whether drug-drug interactions were discoverable without prior hypotheses using data mining. We focused on warfarin-drug interactions as the prototype. We analyzed altered prothrombin time (measured as international normalized ratio [INR]) after initiation of a novel prescription in previously INR-stable warfarin-treated patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Data sets were retrieved from clinical work. Random forest (a machine-learning method) was set up to predict altered INR levels after novel prescriptions. The most important drug groups from the analysis were further investigated using logistic regression in a new data set. Two hundred and twenty drug groups were analyzed in 61\\u2009190 novel prescriptions. We rediscovered 2 drug groups having known interactions (β-lactamase-resistant penicillins [dicloxacillin] and carboxamide derivatives) and 3 antithrombotic/anticoagulant agents (platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate], and heparins) causing decreasing INR. Six drug groups with known interactions were rediscovered causing increasing INR (antiarrhythmics class III [amiodarone], other opioids [tramadol], glucocorticoids, triazole derivatives, and combinations of penicillins, including β-lactamase inhibitors) and two had a known interaction in a closely related drug group (oripavine derivatives [buprenorphine] and natural opium alkaloids). Antipropulsives had an unknown signal of increasing INR. We were able to identify known warfarin-drug interactions without a prior hypothesis using clinical registries. Additionally, we discovered a few potentially novel interactions. This opens up for the use of data mining to discover unknown drug-drug interactions in cardiovascular medicine.',\n",
       "  'Thrombolytic agents activate plasminogen and induce a systemic fibrinolytic and anticoagulant state. Interaction of fibrinolysis with coagulation and platelet aggregation might be important for synergistic interactions with other antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. Thrombolytic agents are most often used in patients with coexisting cardiovascular medication, including various antihypertensives, beta-blocking agents, nitrates and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). In acute coronary syndromes, anticoagulants and antiplatelet compounds such as clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists might be given. Inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 system are not reported to affect the pharmacokinetics of any thrombolytic agent. Since the elimination of the recombinant plasminogen activators saruplase and alteplase is dependent on liver blood flow, drugs affecting hepatic blood flow could theoretically affect the hepatic clearance of these agents. In fact, a reduction in thrombolytic activity has only been demonstrated for alteplase with nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate). Pharmacodynamic interactions occur more often. The additive and beneficial effect of aspirin as concomitant therapy to thrombolysis has been demonstrated without excessive bleeding rates. No data are available on the interaction between ticlopidine or clopidogrel and thrombolytic agents in humans. Anticoagulation by heparin concomitantly with thrombolysis improves the patency rate of the occluded coronary vessel, but bleeding complications are seen more frequently. Although there has been no controlled study on the interaction between oral anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, patients with myocardial infarction who were taking an oral anticoagulant before admission seem to be at higher risk for intracranial haemorrhage during thrombolytic therapy. Currently, no recommendations can be given for possible dose adjustment of thrombolytic therapy in patients receiving antiplatelet comedication. For comedication with heparin, it has been advised to monitor activated partial thromboplastin time frequently and to avoid values >2.5-fold normal. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment should be monitored frequently for bleeding and the physician should be aware of any comedication exerting antiplatelet (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or anticoagulant (e.g. warfarin) effects.',\n",
       "  'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically encountered arrhythmia affecting 0.4% of the general population. Its prevalence increases with age, affecting more than 6% of people over 80 years of age. The annual risk of ischemic stroke in patients with lone AF is approximately 1.3%. This annual risk increases up to 10% -12% in patients with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation and placebo showed a risk reduction of 61% (95% CI 47% to 71%). The absolute risk reduction for stroke with oral anticoagulants is about 3% per year. Aspirin has been shown in meta-analyses to have on average a 20-25% relative risk reduction, and is inferior to oral anticoagulants. In high risk patients with AF warfarin is a class I ACC/AHA indication unless there is a contraindication for anticoagulation. Unfortunately, this therapy requires frequent monitoring with blood samples and the interaction with food and several medications makes its use difficult and sometimes unreliable. It requires strict patient compliance and its use is also linked to potentially serious bleeding complications. In clinical practice, less than 60% of patients who do not have contraindications to oral anticoagulation are actually receiving them. Additionally, of those that receive oral anticoagulation, less than 50% are consistently within therapeutic targets. As such, the \"real world\" efficacy of a strategy towards prescribing oral anticoagulants is likely significantly lower than that demonstrated in clinical trials. As such, the need to discover other methods of anticoagulation with oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and minimal interactions with diet and other pharmacological agents is imperative. Low molecular weight heparin has a more predictable bioavailability and a longer half-life, but its subcutaneous mode of administration and long-term risks, in particular, osteoporosis makes the chronic use of this medication non-feasible. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel have proven efficacy and superiority compared to aspirin to prevent systemic vascular events in at-risk patient populations, but currently they do not play an important role in the prevention of AF related thromboembolic events. The ACTIVE study is a randomized trial comparing the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to oral anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with AF, and was unfortunately terminated prematurely by the data safety and monitoring board because of increased events in the antiplatelet arm. Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as ximelagatran, may be as effective as warfarin for stroke-risk reduction in patients with AF. No anticoagulation monitoring is needed and it has excellent bioavailability, with a twice-daily oral dose. Elevation of liver enzymes was an initial concern regarding the use of this new drug, which is not available for general use. Ongoing pharmacological research and future clinical trials may one day leave the \"warfarin days\" behind. Unfortunately, the new therapies that are being tested seem to be at least several years away from being available on a widespread basis. In this review, we discuss the underlying pathophysiology of AF and stroke. We also provide a comprehensive discussion regarding various available therapies to treat AF.',\n",
       "  'The incidence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in neurological patients continues to increase with expansion of indication for neurointerventional procedures. The pathophysiology of HIT is related to a hypersensitivity reaction against complex platelet factor 4. The diagnosis is mostly clinical and is often confirmed by laboratory testing. Patients with HIT have a higher rate of thromboembolic complications, both arterial and venous, and with worse neurological outcomes at the time of discharge. Early diagnosis and heparin cessation are essential in the management of those patients. Both immediate and prolonged alternative anticoagulation are necessary. Understanding of the mechanism of action, indication and drug interaction of the alternative anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors, fondaparinux and danaparoid) and warfarin is essential during management of these patients.',\n",
       "  'Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of mortality and morbidity, causing over 17.9 million deaths a year worldwide. Currently used therapy is often having side effects and expensive, dietary interventions and alternative medicines are required. Clerodendrum colebrookianum has been used to treat cardiac hypertension but anticoagulant potency was not evaluated. To characterize an active anticoagulant fraction (AAFCC) and a 30\\u202fkDa fibrin(ogen)olytic serine protease (clerofibrase) isolated from aqueous leave extract of C. colebrookianum. AAFCC/clerofibrase was subjected to extensive biochemical and pharmacological characterization including LC-MS/MS, amino acid compositional and GC-MS analyses. Interaction between clerofibrase with fibrinogen was studied by spectrofluorometric analysis. In vitro thrombolytic, antiplatelet and cytotoxicity assay were performed. In vivo toxicity, anticoagulant, defibrinogen and antithrombotic activities were determined on Swiss albino mice. The in vitro anticoagulant activity of AAFCC was found to be superior to heparin and clerofibrase and comparable to Nattokinase and warfarin. The proteomics and amino acid composition analyses suggest that clerofibrase is a previously uncharacterized novel plant protease capable of degrading the -αβ chains of fibrinogen/fibrin. AAFCC/clerofibrase exerts their anticoagulant action via fibrinogenolytic activity and partially by antiplatelet activity albeit they have no effect on thrombin and FXa inhibition. The spectrofluorometric analysis revealed the binding of clerofibrase to fibrinogen but not to thrombin and FXa. The phytochemical constituents and bioactive components of AAFCC were characterized by biochemical, and GC-MS analyses. The AAFCC and clerofibrase inhibited collagen/ADP-induced mammalian platelet aggregation, showed in vitro thrombolytic activity, and non-cytotoxic to mammalian cells. The AAFCC showed and dose-dependent in vivo plasma defibrinogenating and anticoagulant activities and inhibited k-carrageen-induced thrombus formation in the tails of mice. The potent in vivo anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects of AAFCC suggests its pharmacological significance as herbal anticoagulant drug for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperfibrinogenemia- and thrombosis associated cardiovascular disorders.']]"

       "[[\"Warfarin is a highly efficacious oral anticoagulant, but its use is limited by a well-founded fear of bleeding. Drug and food interactions are frequently cited as causes of adverse events with warfarin. We provide an updated systematic overview of the quality, clinical effect, and importance of these reported interactions. MEDLINE, TOXLINE, IPA, and EMBASE databases from October 1993 to March 2004. Database searches combined the keyword warfarin with drug interactions, herbal medicines, Chinese herbal drugs, and food-drug interactions. Eligible articles contained original reports of warfarin drug or food interactions in human subjects. Non-English articles were included if sufficient information could be abstracted. Reports were rated independently by 2 investigators for interaction direction, clinical severity, and quality of evidence. Quality of evidence was based on previously validated causation criteria and study design. Of 642 citations retrieved, 181 eligible articles contained original reports on 120 drugs or foods. Inter-rater agreement was excellent, with weighted kappa values of 0.84 to 1.00. Of all reports, 72% described a potentiation of warfarin's effect and 84% were of poor quality, 86% of which were single case reports. The 31 incidents of clinically significant bleeding were all single case reports. Newly reported interactions included celecoxib, rofecoxib, and herbal substances, such as green tea and danshen. The number of drugs reported to interact with warfarin continues to expand. While most reports are of poor quality and present potentially misleading conclusions, the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil, suggests that coadministration with warfarin should be avoided or closely monitored. More systematic study of warfarin drug interactions in patients is urgently needed.\",\n",
       "  'Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used extensively for the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders, often over the long term, which raises the potential for clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving concomitant medications. These drug-drug interactions have been previously reviewed. However, the current knowledge is likely to have advanced, so a thorough review of the literature published since 2006 was conducted. This identified new studies of drug interactions that are modulated by gastric pH. These studies showed the effect of a PPI-induced increase in intragastric pH on mycophenolate mofetil pharmacokinetics, which were characterised by a decrease in the maximum exposure and availability of mycophenolic acid, at least at early time points. Post-2006 data were also available outlining the altered pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors with concomitant PPI exposure. New data for the more recently marketed dexlansoprazole suggest it has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin. The CYP2C19-mediated interaction that seems to exist between clopidogrel and omeprazole or esomeprazole has been shown to be clinically important in research published since the 2006 review; this effect is not seen as a class effect of PPIs. Finally, data suggest that coadministration of PPIs with methotrexate may affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics, although the mechanism of interaction is not well understood. As was shown in the previous review, individual PPIs differ in their propensities to interact with other drugs and the extent to which their interaction profiles have been defined. The interaction profiles of omeprazole and pantoprazole sodium (pantoprazole-Na) have been studied most extensively. Several studies have shown that omeprazole carries a considerable potential for drug interactions because of its high affinity for CYP2C19 and moderate affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole-Na appears to have lower potential for interactions with other medications. Lansoprazole and rabeprazole also seem to have a weaker potential for interactions than omeprazole, although their interaction profiles, along with those of esomeprazole and dexlansoprazole, have been less extensively investigated. Only a few drug interactions involving PPIs are of clinical significance. Nonetheless, the potential for drug interactions should be considered when choosing a PPI to manage gastric acid-related disorders. This is particularly relevant for elderly patients taking multiple medications, or for those receiving a concomitant medication with a narrow therapeutic index.',\n",
       "  \"* Numerous cocktails using concurrent administration of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-selective probe drugs have been reported to investigate drug-drug interactions in vivo. * This approach has several advantages: characterize the inhibitory or induction potential of compounds in development toward the CYP enzymes identified in vitro in an in vivo situation, assess several enzymes in the same trial, and have complete in vivo information about potential CYP-based drug interactions. * This study describes a new cocktail containing five probe drugs that has never been published. * This cocktail can be used to test the effects of a new chemical entity on multiple CYP isoforms in a single clinical study: CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A (midazolam) and was designed to overcome potential liabilities of other reported cocktails. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selective substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol) and CYP3A (midazolam) when administered orally and concurrently as a cocktail relative to the drugs administered alone. This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, six-treatment six-period six-sequence William's design study with a wash-out of 7 or 14 days. Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC. There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25. The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo.\",\n",
       "  'Esomeprazole, the (S)-isomer of omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor (PPI) developed as a single isomer for the treatment of patients with acid related diseases. Because of the extensive use of PPIs, the documentation of the potential for drug interactions with esomeprazole is of great importance. Altered absorption or metabolism are 2 of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions. Since intragastric pH will increase with esomeprazole treatment, it can be hypothesised that the absorption of drugs with pH-sensitive absorption (e.g. digoxin and ketoconazole) may be affected. Esomeprazole does not seem to have any potential to interact with drugs that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 or 2E1. In drug interaction studies with diazepam, phenytoin and (R)-warfarin, it was shown that esomeprazole has the potential to interact with CYP2C19. The slightly altered metabolism of cisapride was also suggested to be the result of inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for cisapride mediated by CYP2C19. Esomeprazole did not interact with the CYP3A4 substrates clarithromycin (2 studies) or quinidine. Since the slightly increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of cisapride could be explained as an inhibition of CYP2C19, the data on these 3 CYP3A4 substrates indicate that esomeprazole does not have the potential to inhibit this enzyme. The minor effects reported for diazepam, phenytoin, (R)-warfarin, and cisapride are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Clarithromycin interacts with the metabolism of esomeprazole resulting in a doubling of the AUC of esomeprazole. The increased plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are unlikely to have any safety implications. It can be concluded that the potential for drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole is low, and similar to that reported for omeprazole.',\n",
       "  \"St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum, SJW) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants for the treatment of minor to moderate depression. A major safety concern about SJW is its ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and/or clinical response of a variety of clinically important drugs that have distinctive chemical structure, mechanism of action and metabolic pathways. This review highlights and updates the knowledge on clinical interactions of prescribed drugs with SJW and the implication in drug development. A number of clinically significant interactions of SJW have been identified with conventional drugs, including anticancer agents (imatinib and irinotecan), anti-HIV agents (e.g. indinavir, lamivudine and nevirapine), anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. ibuprofen and fexofenadine), antimicrobial agents (e.g. erythromycin and voriconazole), cardiovascular drugs (e.g. digoxin, ivabradine, warfarin, verapamil, nifedipine and talinolol), central nervous system agents (e.g. amitriptyline, buspirone, phenytoin, methadone, midazolam, alprazolam, and sertraline), hypoglycaemic agents (e.g. tolbutamide and gliclazide), immuno-modulating agents (e.g. cyclosporine and tacrolimus), oral contraceptives, proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole), respiratory system agent (e.g. theophylline), statins (e.g. atorvastatin and pravastatin). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in the interactions of drugs with SJW. For pharmacokinetic changes of drugs by SJW, induction of cytochrome P450s (e.g. CYP2C9 and 3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are considered the major mechanism. Thus, it is not a surprise that many drugs that interact with SJW are substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp. A comprehensive understanding of clinical drugs that interact with SJW has important implications in drug development. New drugs may be designed to minimize interactions with SJW; and new SJW formulations may be designed to avoid drug interactions. Further clinical and mechanistic studies are warranted to explore the interaction of SJW with other important drugs and the potential clinical impact.\",\n",
       "  'Pazopanib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-kit kinases, inhibits multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in vitro. This study in patients with advanced cancer evaluated the effect of pazopanib on CYP450 function by comparing the pharmacokinetics of CYP-specific probe drugs in the presence and absence of pazopanib. The probes used included midazolam (CYP3A specific), warfarin (CYP2C9 specific), omeprazole (CYP2C19 specific), caffeine (CYP1A2 specific), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 specific). The estimated ratios of the geometric means (90% confidence interval (CI)) for the area under the curve to the last measurable point (AUC(0-t)) for these probe drugs with/without pazopanib were as follows: midazolam, 1.35 (1.18-1.54); omeprazole, 0.81 (0.59-1.12); caffeine, 1.00 (0.77-1.30); and S-warfarin, 0.93 (0.84-1.03). The geometric least-squares (LS) mean ratio of urine dextromethorphan:dextrorphan ranged from 1.33 (0-4-h interval) to 1.64 (4-8-h interval). The data suggest that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and has no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in patients with advanced cancer.'],\n",
       " [\"Ezetimibe is the first lipid-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised (>80%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.\",\n",
       "  'Bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Following oral administration, bosentan attains peak plasma concentrations after approximately 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability is about 50%. Food does not exert a clinically relevant effect on absorption at the recommended dose of 125 mg. Bosentan is approximately 98% bound to albumin and, during multiple-dose administration, has a volume of distribution of 30 L and a clearance of 17 L/h. The terminal half-life after oral administration is 5.4 hours and is unchanged at steady state. Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 3-5 days after multiple-dose administration, when plasma concentrations are decreased by about 50% because of a 2-fold increase in clearance, probably due to induction of metabolising enzymes. Bosentan is mainly eliminated from the body by hepatic metabolism and subsequent biliary excretion of the metabolites. Three metabolites have been identified, formed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4. The metabolite Ro 48-5033 may contribute 20% to the total response following administration of bosentan. The pharmacokinetics of bosentan are dose-proportional up to 600 mg (single dose) and 500 mg/day (multiple doses). The pharmacokinetics of bosentan in paediatric PAH patients are comparable to those in healthy subjects, whereas adult PAH patients show a 2-fold increased exposure. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min) and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) do not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of bosentan. No dosage adjustment in adults is required based on sex, age, ethnic origin and bodyweight. Bosentan should generally be avoided in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and/or elevated liver aminotransferases. Ketoconazole approximately doubles the exposure to bosentan because of inhibition of CYP3A4. Bosentan decreases exposure to ciclosporin, glibenclamide, simvastatin (and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin) and (R)- and (S)-warfarin by up to 50% because of induction of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9. Coadministration of ciclosporin and bosentan markedly increases initial bosentan trough concentrations. Concomitant treatment with glibenclamide and bosentan leads to an increase in the incidence of aminotransferase elevations. Therefore, combined use with ciclosporin and glibenclamide is contraindicated and not recommended, respectively. The possibility of reduced efficacy of CYP2C9 and 3A4 substrates should be considered when coadministered with bosentan. No clinically relevant interaction was detected with the P-glycoprotein substrate digoxin. In healthy subjects, bosentan doses >300 mg increase plasma levels of endothelin-1. The drug moderately reduces blood pressure, and its main adverse effects are headache, flushing, increased liver aminotransferases, leg oedema and anaemia. In a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study in PAH patients, the haemodynamic effects lagged the plasma concentrations of bosentan.',\n",
       "  \"There is a worldwide increasing use of herbs which are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potential for herb-drug interactions. St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants. A literature search was performed using Medline (via Pubmed), Biological Abstracts, Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO and Embase (all from their inception to September 2003) to identify known drug interaction with St John's wort. The available data indicate that St John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PgP), although it may inhibit or induce other CYPs, depending on the dose, route and duration of administration. Data from human studies and case reports indicate that St John's wort decreased the blood concentrations of amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, fexofenadine, indinavir, methadone, midazolam, nevirapine, phenprocoumon, simvastatin, tacrolimus, theophylline and warfarin, whereas it did not alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, dextromethorphan, mycophenolic acid and pravastatin. St John's wort decreased the plasma concentration of the active metabolite SN-38 in cancer patients receiving irinotecan treatment. St John's wort did not alter the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, but increased the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Several cases have been reported that St John's wort decreased cyclosporine blood concentration leading to organ rejection. St John's wort caused breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancies when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives. It also caused serotonin syndrome when coadministered with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (e.g. sertaline and paroxetine). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in these interactions. Because the potential interaction of St John's wort with other drugs is a major safety concern, additional systematic research on herb-drug interactions and appropriate regulation in herbal safety and efficacy is needed.\",\n",
       "  \"Use of herbal medicines among patients under cardiovascular pharmacotherapy is widespread. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to determine the possible interactions between herbal medicines and cardiovascular drugs. The Medline database was searched for clinical articles published between January 1996 and February 2003. Forty-three case reports and eight clinical trials were identified. Warfarin was the most common cardiovascular drug involved. It was found to interact with boldo, curbicin, fenugreek, garlic, danshen, devil's claw, don quai, ginkgo, papaya, lycium, mango, PC-SPES (resulting in over-anticoagulation) and with ginseng, green tea, soy and St. John's wort (causing decreased anticoagulant effect). Gum guar, St. John's wort, Siberian ginseng and wheat bran were found to decrease plasma digoxin concentration; aspirin interactions include spontaneous hyphema when associated with ginkgo and increased bioavailability if combined with tamarind. Decreased plasma concentration of simvastatin or lovastatin was observed after co-administration with St. John's wort and wheat bran, respectively. Other adverse events include hypertension after co-administration of ginkgo and a diuretic thiazide, hypokalemia after liquorice and antihypertensives and anticoagulation after phenprocoumon and St. John's wort. Interaction between herbal medicine and cardiovascular drugs is a potentially important safety issue. Patients taking anticoagulants are at the highest risk.\",\n",
       "  \"Recently, interactions of herbal medicines with synthetic drugs came into focus of particular interest. In the past 3 years, more than 50 papers were published regarding interactions between St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.; SJW) and prescription drugs. Co-medication with SJW resulted in decreased plasma concentrations of a number of drugs including amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, indinavir, irinotecan, warfarin, phenprocoumon, alprazolam, dextrometorphane, simvastatin, and oral contraceptives. Sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports indicate that SJW is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4) and/or P-glycoprotein. Recent studies could show that the degree of enzyme induction by SJW correlates strongly with the amount of hyperforin found in the product. Products that do not contain substantial amounts of hyperforin (<1%) have not been shown to produce clinically relevant enzyme induction. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that hyperforin may also contribute to the antidepressant activity of SJW. However, clinical studies using SJW preparations with a low hyperforin amount (<1%) clearly demonstrated the superiority of this plant extract over placebo and its equivalence to imipramine and fluoxetine in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of depression. In the present paper clinical significant SJW interactions are critically evaluated against the background of hyperforin.\",\n",
       "  'The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent novel therapeutic approaches in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus; they act on kidneys to decrease the renal threshold for glucose (RTG) and increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Canagliflozin is an orally active, reversible, selective SGLT2 inhibitor. Orally administered canagliflozin is rapidly absorbed achieving peak plasma concentrations in 1-2\\xa0h. Dose-proportional systemic exposure to canagliflozin has been observed over a wide dose range (50-1600\\xa0mg) with an oral bioavailability of 65\\xa0%. Canagliflozin is glucuronidated into two inactive metabolites, M7 and M5 by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 and UGT2B4, respectively. Canagliflozin reaches steady state in 4\\xa0days, and there is minimal accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Approximately 60\\xa0% and 33\\xa0% of the administered dose is excreted in the feces and urine, respectively. The half-life of orally administered canagliflozin 100 or 300\\xa0mg in healthy participants is 10.6 and 13.1\\xa0h, respectively. No clinically relevant differences are observed in canagliflozin exposure with respect to age, race, sex, and body weight. The pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin remains unaffected by mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Systemic exposure to canagliflozin is increased in patients with renal impairment relative to those with normal renal function; however, the efficacy is reduced in patients with renal impairment owing to the reduced filtered glucose load. Canagliflozin did not show clinically relevant drug interactions with metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, oral contraceptives, probenecid, and cyclosporine, while co-administration with rifampin modestly reduced canagliflozin plasma concentrations and thus may necessitate an appropriate monitoring of glycemic control. Canagliflozin increases UGE and suppresses RTG in a dose-dependent manner, thereby lowering the plasma glucose levels and reducing the glycosylated hemoglobin levels through an insulin-independent mechanism of action. The 300-mg dose provides near-maximal effects on RTG throughout the full 24-h dosing interval, whereas the effect of the 100-mg dose on RTG is near-maximal for approximately 12\\xa0h and is modestly attenuated during the overnight period. The observed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus supports a once-daily dosing regimen.'],\n",
       " [\"To evaluate the quality of studies about drugs and food interactions with warfarin and their clinical relevance. MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases from 1966 to October 1993 using the Medical Subject Headings warfarin, drug interactions, and English only. All articles reporting original data on drug and food interactions with warfarin. Each report, rated independently by at least two investigators (using causality assessment), received a summary score indicating the level of assurance (level 1 = highly probable, level 2 = probable, level 3 = possible, and level 4 = doubtful) that a clinically important interaction had or had not occurred. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using a weighted kappa statistic. Of 793 retrieved citations, 120 contained original reports on 186 interactions. The weighted kappa statistic was 0.67, representing substantial agreement. Of 86 different drugs and foods appraised, 43 had level 1 evidence. Of these, 26 drugs and foods did interact with warfarin. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was potentiated by 6 antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, isoniazid, metronidazole, and miconazole); 5 cardiac drugs (amiodarone, clofibrate, propafenone, propranolol, and sulfinpyrazone); phenylbutazone; piroxicam; alcohol (only with concomitant liver disease); cimetidine; and omeprazole. Three patients had a hemorrhage at the time of a potentiating interaction (caused by alcohol, isoniazid, and phenylbutazone). Warfarin's anticoagulant effect was inhibited by 3 antibiotics (griseofulvin, rifampin, and nafcillin); 3 drugs active on the central nervous system (barbiturates, carbamazepine, and chlordiazepoxide); cholestyramine; sucralfate; foods high in vitamin K; and large amounts of avocado. Many drugs and foods interact with warfarin, including antibiotics, drugs affecting the central nervous system, and cardiac medications. Many of these drug interactions increase warfarin's anticoagulant effect.\",\n",
       "  'There are 3 main classes of systemic antifungals: the polyene macrolides (e.g. amphotericin B), the azoles (e.g. the imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole and the triazoles itraconazole and fluconazole) and the allylamines (e.g. terbinafine). Other systemic antifungals include griseofulvin and flucytosine. Most drug-drug interactions involving systemic antifungals have negative consequences. The interactions of amphotericin B, flucytosine, griseofulvin, terbinafine and azole antifungals can be divided into the following categories: (i) additive dangerous interactions; (ii) modifications of antifungal kinetics by other drugs; and (iii) modifications of the kinetics of other drugs by antifungals. Amphotericin B and flucytosine mainly interact with other agents pharmacodynamically. Clinically important drug interactions with amphotericin B cause nephrotoxicity, hypokalaemia and blood dyscrasias. The most important drug interaction of flucytosine occurs with myelotoxic agents. Hypokalaemia can precipitate the long QT syndrome, as well as potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias like torsade de pointes. Synergism is likely to occur when either QT interval-modifying drugs (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole) and drugs that induce hypokalaemia (e.g. amphotericin B) are coadministered. Induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes at hepatic and extrahepatic sites are the mechanisms that underlie the most serious pharmacokinetic drug interactions of the azole antifungals. These agents have been shown to notably decrease the catabolism of numerous drugs: histamine H1 receptor antagonists, warfarin, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, digoxin, felodipine, lovastatin, midazolam, triazolam, methylprednisolone, glibenclamide (glyburide), phenytoin, rifabutin, ritonavir, saquinavir, nevirapine and nortriptyline. Non-antifungal drugs like carbamazepine, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), phenytoin and rifampicin (rifampin) can induce the metabolism of azole antifungals. The bioavailability of ketoconazole and itraconazole is also reduced by drugs that increase gastric pH, such as H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and didanosine. Griseofulvin is an enzymatic inducer of coumarin-like drugs and estrogens, whereas terbinafine seems to have a low potential for drug interactions. Despite important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetic drug interactions during the 1990s, at this time they still remain difficult to predict in terms of magnitude in individual patients. This is because of the large interindividual and intraindividual variations in the catalytic activity of those metabolising enzymes that can either be induced or inhibited by various drugs. Notwithstanding these variations, increasing clinical experience is allowing pharmacokinetic interactions to be used to advantage in order to improve the tolerability of some drugs, as recently exemplified by the use of a fixed combination of ketoconazole and cyclosporin.',\n",
       "  'The aim of this study was to determine whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between warfarin and orally administered anti-infectives increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in warfarin users. We conducted a nested case-control and case-crossover study using US Medicaid data. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between GI bleeding and prior use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, co-trimoxazole, or fluconazole vs. no exposure and also vs. use of cephalexin, which would not be expected to interact with warfarin. All of the anti-infectives examined were associated with elevated odds ratios (ORs) when compared to no exposure to these drugs. With cephalexin data as the reference, the ORs for co-trimoxazole (OR: 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-2.33) in the prior 6-10 days) and fluconazole (OR: 2.09 (95% CI: 1.34-3.26) in the prior 11-15 days) were significantly elevated. Warfarin users who had received an anti-infective agent showed a substantially increased risk of GI bleeding.

This approach begins with a determination of an in vitro Ki value (22 microM), which may be used to relate fluconazole plasma concentrations to inhibitory effect on P4502C9 activity and (S)-warfarin half-life. A means for adding fluconazole to a therapeutic regimen of warfarin is proposed that involves a stepped reduction of the warfarin dose over 5 days to a final target daily dose that is determined by the fluconazole dose level. The effect of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability on outcome quality is explored in simulation studies that indicate that a stepped-dose reduction schedule will be superior to a one-time dose reduction. The in vivo K, was found to predict accurately the magnitude of the fluconazole interaction study with another P4502C9 substrate tolbutamide.',\n",
       "  'To assess the frequency of potential azole-drug interactions and consequences of interactions between fluconazole and other drugs in routine inpatient care. We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients treated for systemic fungal infections with an oral or intravenous azole medication between July 1997 and June 2001 in a tertiary care hospital. We recorded the concomitant use of medications known to interact with azole antifungals and measured the frequency of potential azole drug interactions, which we considered to be present when both drugs were given together. We then performed a chart review on a random sample of admissions in which patients were exposed to a potential moderate or major drug interaction with fluconazole. The list of azole-interacting medications and the severity of interaction were derived from the DRUGDEX System and Drug Interaction Facts. Among the 4,185 admissions in which azole agents (fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole) were given, 2,941 (70.3%) admissions experienced potential azole-drug interactions, which included 2,716 (92.3%) admissions experiencing potential fluconazole interactions. The most frequent interactions with potential moderate to major severity were co-administration of fluconazole with prednisone (25.3%), midazolam (17.5%), warfarin (14.7%), methylprednisolone (14.1%), cyclosporine (10.7%) and nifedipine (10.1%). Charts were reviewed for 199 admissions in which patients were exposed to potential fluconazole drug interactions. While four adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by fluconazole were found, none was felt to be caused by a drug-drug interaction (DDI), although in one instance fluconazole may have contributed. Potential fluconazole drug interactions were very frequent among hospitalized patients on systemic azole antifungal therapy, but they had few apparent clinical consequences.',\n",
       "  'Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Although irbesartan does not require biotransformation for its pharmacological activity, it does undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isoenzyme and negligible metabolism by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The long term treatment of patients with hypertension is generally required for effective management of the disease, and the use of concurrent medications is usually inevitable. This paper reviews the drug and food interaction trials involving irbesartan that have been conducted to date. Based on the available literature, no significant interactions have been identified between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, simvastatin, tolbutamide, warfarin, magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, digoxin or food. Fluconazole did increase the steady-state peak plasma concentration (by 19%) and area under the concentration-time curve (by 63%) of irbesartan, but these increases are not likely to be clinically significant. In summary, irbesartan has demonstrated minimal potential for drug or food interactions in trials conducted to date.'],\n",
       " ['The binding of erythromycin base (EB) to human plasma (HP) proteins was measured by equilibrium dialysis using EB-14C at approximately 0.5 microgram/ml in the plasma phase, expected therapeutic concentration. EB was 64.5 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- S.D.) bound to HP. The percentage of bound EB was linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations linearly related to the logarithm of HP dilution. Physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and a1 acid glycoprotein (a1AGP) bound 8.7 +/- 1.6 and 54.5 +/- 0.6%, respectively, of the drug. No binding of EB to HDL or LDL or human gamma globulins was found. For HSA separately, EB binding followed a non-saturable phenomenon with n\\'K\\' = 100 +/- 5, while for a1AGP the binding was following a saturable phenomenon with n\" = 1 +/- 0.045, K\" = 35,000 +/- 5000 M-1. It can then be shown that, in human plasma, EB is only bound to those two proteins: firstly by computing the binding of EB to HSA and a1AGP with the previously indicated parameters, and secondly by measuring the binding of EB to HP. The computed curve fairly fits to the measured one. Interaction of EB with HP involved hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen forces. Lower than 37 degrees C temperatures decreased EB binding. Significant competitive binding was demonstrated between EB and acetylsalicylic acid, furosemide, phenylbutazone, warfarin and bilirubin.',\n",
       "  'This paper describes the protein binding of cefazolin to human serum and to human serum albumin (HSA) using equilibrium dialysis. The drug is exclusively bound to HSA with a moderate affinity, Ka = 16,600 +/- 1600 M-1, and one saturable binding site, n = 0.73 +/- 0.02. Moreover cefazolin shows a dose-dependent binding leading a possible increase of the free fraction (when its total concentration increases). This antibiotic is displaced by free fatty acids (FFA) and bilirubin. Cefazolin binding to human serum and human serum albumin (HSA) was studied in presence of acidic drugs. At low concentrations clofibric acid and phenylbutazone both exhibiting high affinity for HSA displace strongly cefazolin. Valproic and salicylic acids, sulfamethoxazole, cefoperazone which have approximately the same affinity as cefazolin, must be used at higher concentrations to displace this antibiotic. A particular phenomenon was observed with cefazolin on HSA when associated with furosemide. A low concentration (5-25 microM) of this drug induces a positive cooperativity of binding between cefazolin and HSA. But at a molar ratio of furosemide to albumin greater than one, such cooperative interaction disappears and a competitive inhibition of cefazolin binding occurs. For all drugs studied, a competitive inhibition was found except for tryptophan. Finally, it is concluded that cefazolin shares the warfarin binding site on HSA.',\n",
       "  'The methacrylate-copolymer Eudragit EPO (EPO) has raised interest in solubility enhancement of anionic drugs. Effects on aqueous drug solubility at rather low polymer concentrations are barely known despite their importance upon dissolution and dilution of oral dosage forms. We provide evidence for substantial enhancement (factor 4-230) of aqueous solubility of poorly water-soluble anionic drugs induced by low (0.1-5% (w/w)) concentration of EPO for a panel of seven acidic crystalline drugs. Diffusion data (determined by <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) indicate that the solubility increasing effect monitored by quantitative ultraperformance liquid chromatography was caused primarily by molecular API polymer interactions in the bulk liquid phase. Residual solid API remained unaltered as tested by X-ray powder diffraction. The solubility enhancement (SE) revealed a significant rank correlation (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = -0.83) with rDiff<sub>API</sub>, where SE and rDiff<sub>API</sub> are defined ratios of solubility and diffusion coefficient in the presence and absence of EPO. SE decreased in the order of indomethacin, mefenamic acid, warfarin, piroxicam, furosemide, bezafibrate, and tolbutamide. The solubilizing effect was attributed to both ionic and hydrophobic interactions between drugs and EPO. The excellent solubilizing properties of EPO are highly promising for pharmaceutical development, and the data set provides first steps toward an understanding of drug-excipient interaction mechanisms.',\n",
       "  'The novel iron-based phosphate binder sucroferric oxyhydroxide is being investigated for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Patients with chronic kidney disease often have multiple comorbidities that may necessitate the daily use of several types of medication. Therefore, the potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and selected drugs commonly taken by dialysis patients were investigated. Five Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover studies in healthy volunteers investigated the effect of a single dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide 1 g (based on iron content) on the pharmacokinetics of losartan 100 mg, furosemide 40 mg, omeprazole 40 mg, digoxin 0.5 mg and warfarin 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters [including area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-∞) and from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24)] for these drugs were determined: alone in the presence of food; with sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the presence of food; 2 h after food and sucroferric oxyhydroxide administration. Systemic exposure based on AUC0-∞ for all drugs, and AUC0-24 for all drugs except omeprazole (for which AUC 0-8 h was measured), was unaffected to a clinically significant extent by the presence of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, irrespective of whether sucroferric oxyhydroxide was administered with the drug or 2 h earlier. There is a low risk of drug-drug interactions between sucroferric oxyhydroxide and losartan, furosemide, digoxin and warfarin. There is also a low risk of drug-drug interaction with omeprazole (based on AUC0-∞ values). Therefore, sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be administered concomitantly without the need to adjust the dosage regimens of these drugs.'],\n",
       " [\"* Numerous cocktails using concurrent administration of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-selective probe drugs have been reported to investigate drug-drug interactions in vivo. * This approach has several advantages: characterize the inhibitory or induction potential of compounds in development toward the CYP enzymes identified in vitro in an in vivo situation, assess several enzymes in the same trial, and have complete in vivo information about potential CYP-based drug interactions. * This study describes a new cocktail containing five probe drugs that has never been published. * This cocktail can be used to test the effects of a new chemical entity on multiple CYP isoforms in a single clinical study: CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol), and CYP3A (midazolam) and was designed to overcome potential liabilities of other reported cocktails. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selective substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (metoprolol) and CYP3A (midazolam) when administered orally and concurrently as a cocktail relative to the drugs administered alone. This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, six-treatment six-period six-sequence William's design study with a wash-out of 7 or 14 days. Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC. There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25. The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo.\",\n",
       "  'This review summarizes the results of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies in man with pantoprazole, a new, selective proton pump inhibitor. Various mechanisms have to be considered as causes for potential drug-drug interactions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring, the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, via either induction or inhibition. With the increasing use of PPIs, their interaction potential gains therapeutic importance as was the case with the first and second generation of H2-blockers (cimetidine and ranitidine, respectively). The enhanced selectivity of pantoprazole to the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase characterizes the new PPI generation. In contrast to omeprazole, pantoprazole has a low potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 system in man. In the drug interaction studies conducted so far, substrates for all relevant cytochrome P450 families involved in the metabolism of drugs in man were investigated. Pantoprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glibenclamide, a hormonal contraceptive (combination of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin in man. Pantoprazole also neither induced the metabolism of antipyrine or caffeine, nor increased urinary excretion of the induction markers D-glucaric acid and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol.

       "  'This open-label drug-drug interaction study assessed whether blockade by dupilumab of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 signaling affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of five CYP450 substrates given orally (midazolam, omeprazole, S-warfarin, caffeine, and metoprolol, metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6, respectively) were evaluated before and 28 days after initiation of dupilumab treatment (subcutaneous 300\\u2009mg weekly) in 14 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates, provided substantial clinical benefit, and was generally well tolerated. Only one serious adverse event was reported, an episode of systemic inflammatory response syndrome that resolved after treatment was discontinued. In summary, blockade of IL-4/IL-13 signaling in patients with type 2 inflammation does not appear to significantly affect CYP450 enzyme activities; the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis patients is unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates.',\n",
       "  \"According to the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin because it was associated with fewer strokes, systemic embolism, and bleeding.

No previous studies were published to examine the nature and frequency of drug related problems among hospitalized patients in Palestinian hospitals. Prospective observational study was conducted to report and record the natural and frequency of drug related problems in two general hospitals. The study included 212 patients, 54.4 % female, with a mean age 62.2 (±10.6 SD). 88% of the patients were reported with one or more DRPs, with an average of 1.9 DRPs per patient were found. The most prevalent DRP was incorrect dosing regimen which was represented by (22.2%), followed by drug-drug interaction (19.4%), drugs need laboratory tests (15.2%). Ceftriaxone, warfarin, enoxapirin and dogixin were the drugs causing most frequent DRPs. The drug groups causing most DRPs were anti-infective agents, anti-thrombotic agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Once discovered, the majority of DRPs (71.6%) were accepted by the physicians and solved immediately, while 11.5 % of pharmacist advice was not approved. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the number of medications (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.31-3.76) and the number of medical conditions (RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.11-3.13) independently predicted the number of DRPs.

       "  \"Ceftriaxone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics due to its availability, wide spectrum of activity and low toxicity. However, irrational use of ceftriaxone is one of the current issues in most countries, especially developing ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate ceftriaxone utilization in different wards of Ras-Desta Memorial General Hospital (RDMGH) in Ethiopia. An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 1,079 patients who were admitted to RDMGH from May 2017 to April 2018. A structured data abstraction format was used to collect data from patients' medical chart. Micromedex® drug interaction checker was used to identify significant drug-drug interactions, and national and international guidelines were used to evaluate the appropriateness of ceftriaxone use. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. Among the 1,079 patients enrolled, ceftriaxone was utilized by 601 (55.7%) patients, and these patients were considered for evaluation of appropriateness and subsequent analysis. Among 601 patients, ceftriaxone was used for therapeutic purpose in 362 (60.2%) patients; of which, 359 (99.2%) were for empiric therapy and the rest 239 (39.8%) were for prophylaxis. In the majority of the patients, the dose of ceftriaxone was 2g/day 472 (78.6%) and for a duration of 2-7 days 409 (68.1%). Inappropriate use of ceftriaxone was observed among 237 (39.4%) patients with regard to indication, dose/frequency and duration. About half (49.3%) of the deviation from the guidelines was observed from surgical and gynecologic/obstetrics wards. Among the co-prescribed medications with ceftriaxone, ringer lactate, warfarin and heparin were found to have a significant drug-drug interaction. This study revealed that inappropriate use of ceftriaxone was high in RDMGH. This may increase the emergence of resistant pathogens which may lead to treatment failure and increase cost of therapy. Therefore, adherence to current evidence-based guidelines is recommended.\"],\n",

However, LMWHs are so far only administered by parenteral route. Thus, they are usually replaced by oral warfarin for outpatient therapy. Since warfarin has a slow onset and high incidence of drug-drug interaction, there is a great need for the development of an oral LMWH formulation. LMWH (tinzaparin)-loaded nanoparticles prepared with a blend of a polyester and a polycationic polymethacrylate by the double emulsion method were administered orally in fasted rabbits. The plasma tinzaparin concentration was measured by a chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay. After oral administration of two doses of tinzaparin-loaded nanoparticles (200 and 600 anti-Xa U/kg), the oral absorption was observed between 4 and 10 or 12 h, with a delayed onset of action ranging from 3 to 4 h. Mean absolute bioavailabilities were 51% and 59% for the two tested doses. We now report that the encapsulation of tinzaparin into nanoparticles is likely to contribute to its oral efficacy with an anticoagulant effect prolonged up to 8 h.',\n",
       "  \"Drug interactions resulting in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a major health problem both for individuals and the community. Despite this, limited information is reported in the literature on the drug interaction categories responsible for causing ADRs. In the study reported here, we investigated the drug combinations most frequently co-reported as interacting in the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database, VigiBase, and categorised these according to the drug interaction mechanism. Reports in which drug combinations were co-reported as interacting in at least 20 reports in VigiBase during the past 20 years were included in the study. Each drug combination was reviewed in the literature to identify the mechanism of interaction and subsequently classified as pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic reaction. Report characteristics were also analysed. A total of 3766 case reports of drug interactions from 47 countries were identified. Of the 123 different drug combinations reported, 113 were described in the literature to interact. The mechanism of the drug interaction was categorised as pharmacodynamic (46 combinations; 41%), pharmacokinetic (28; 25%), a combination of both types (18; 16%) and unidentified (21; 19%). Pharmacodynamic drug interactions primarily concerned pharmacological additive effects, whereas enzyme inhibition was the most frequent pharmacokinetic interaction. The combinations reviewed primarily implicated drugs such as warfarin, heparin, carbamazepine and digoxin. Drug interactions reported in globally collected ADR reports cover both pharmacodynamic, specifically additive pharmacological effects, and pharmacokinetic mechanisms primarily accredited to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. These ADR reports often concern serious threats to patients' safety and are particularly related to the use of high risk drugs such as warfarin and heparin.\",\n",
       "  'Thrombolytic agents activate plasminogen and induce a systemic fibrinolytic and anticoagulant state. Interaction of fibrinolysis with coagulation and platelet aggregation might be important for synergistic interactions with other antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. Thrombolytic agents are most often used in patients with coexisting cardiovascular medication, including various antihypertensives, beta-blocking agents, nitrates and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). In acute coronary syndromes, anticoagulants and antiplatelet compounds such as clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists might be given. Inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 system are not reported to affect the pharmacokinetics of any thrombolytic agent. Since the elimination of the recombinant plasminogen activators saruplase and alteplase is dependent on liver blood flow, drugs affecting hepatic blood flow could theoretically affect the hepatic clearance of these agents. In fact, a reduction in thrombolytic activity has only been demonstrated for alteplase with nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate). Pharmacodynamic interactions occur more often. The additive and beneficial effect of aspirin as concomitant therapy to thrombolysis has been demonstrated without excessive bleeding rates. No data are available on the interaction between ticlopidine or clopidogrel and thrombolytic agents in humans. Anticoagulation by heparin concomitantly with thrombolysis improves the patency rate of the occluded coronary vessel, but bleeding complications are seen more frequently. Although there has been no controlled study on the interaction between oral anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, patients with myocardial infarction who were taking an oral anticoagulant before admission seem to be at higher risk for intracranial haemorrhage during thrombolytic therapy. Currently, no recommendations can be given for possible dose adjustment of thrombolytic therapy in patients receiving antiplatelet comedication. For comedication with heparin, it has been advised to monitor activated partial thromboplastin time frequently and to avoid values >2.5-fold normal. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment should be monitored frequently for bleeding and the physician should be aware of any comedication exerting antiplatelet (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or anticoagulant (e.g. warfarin) effects.',\n",

Early diagnosis and heparin cessation are essential in the management of those patients. Both immediate and prolonged alternative anticoagulation are necessary.
