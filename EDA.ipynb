      "The APOE ε4 allele remains the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and the APOE ε2 allele the strongest genetic protective factor after multiple large scale genome-wide association studies and genome-wide association meta-analyses. However, no therapies directed at APOE are currently available. Although initial studies causally linked APOE with amyloid-β peptide aggregation and clearance, over the past 5 years our understanding of APOE pathogenesis has expanded beyond amyloid-β peptide-centric mechanisms to tau neurofibrillary degeneration, microglia and astrocyte responses, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Because all these pathological processes can potentially contribute to cognitive impairment, it is important to use this new knowledge to develop therapies directed at APOE. Several therapeutic approaches have been successful in mouse models expressing human APOE alleles, including increasing or reducing APOE levels, enhancing its lipidation, blocking the interactions between APOE and amyloid-β peptide, and genetically switching APOE4 to APOE3 or APOE2 isoforms, but translation to human clinical trials has proven challenging.\n",
      "Mutation on both the copies of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene results in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a recessively transmitted genetic disorder. It is hypothesized that individuals heterozygous for CFTR gene mutation may develop obstructive pulmonary diseases like asthma. There is great heterogeneity in the phenotypic presentation and severity of CF lung disease. This could be due to genetic or environmental factors. Several modifier genes have been identified which may directly or indirectly interact with CFTR pathway and affect the severity of disease. This review article discusses the information related to the association of CFTR gene mutation with asthma. Association between CFTR gene mutation and asthma is still unclear. Report ranges from studies showing positive or protective association to those showing no association. Therefore, studies with sufficiently large sample size and detailed phenotype are required to define the potential contribution of CFTR in the pathogenesis of asthma.\n",
      "Functional variants in the interleukin-6 receptor gene (IL6R) are associated with asthma risk. We hypothesized that genes co-expressed with IL6R might also be regulated by genetic polymorphisms that are associated with asthma risk. The aim of this study was to identify such genes. To identify genes whose expression was correlated with that of IL6R, we analyzed gene expression levels generated for 373 human lymphoblastoid cell lines by the Geuvadis consortium and for 38 hematopoietic cell types by the Differentiation Map Portal (DMAP) project. Genes correlated with IL6R were then screened for nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with both variation in gene expression levels (eSNPs) and asthma risk. We identified 90 genes with expression levels correlated with those of IL6R and that also had a nearby eSNP associated with disease risk in a published asthma GWAS (N = 20 776). For 16 (18%) genes, the association between the eSNP and asthma risk replicated with the same direction of effect in a further independent published asthma GWAS (N = 27 378). Among the top replicated associations (FDR < 0.05) were eSNPs for four known (IL18R1, IL18RAP, BCL6, and STAT6) and one putative novel asthma risk gene, stomatin-like protein 2 (STOML2). The expression of STOML2 was negatively correlated with IL6R, while eSNPs that increased the expression of STOML2 were associated with an increased asthma risk. The expression of STOML2, a gene that plays a key role in mitochondrial function and T-cell activation, is associated with both IL-6 signaling and asthma risk.\n",
      "Antiretroviral options for patients infected with multiclass resistant HIV-1 warrant the development of new agents with unique mechanisms of action and modes of delivery. Here we review one such agent, ibalizumab, a parenteral CD4 postattachment inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy as part of combination antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV-1. In a phase III clinical trial in HIV-infected participants with multiclass antiretroviral drug resistance, the intravenous administration of ibalizumab led to declines in plasma HIV-1 RNA more than 0.5 log in 83% of participants at 1 week. An optimized background antiretroviral regimen was then added, and plasma HIV-1 RNA became less than 50 copies/ml in 43% of participants at 24 weeks. Adverse effects of ibalizumab were uncommon and generally low grade. Ibalizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on March 16, 2018, under the trade name Trogarzo. Ibalizumab has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Its primary use will be in the setting of multidrug resistant virus as part of combination antiretroviral therapy. Further enhancements of ibalizumab to prolong its clearance and broaden its activity are in development.\n",
      "BRG1, an ATPase subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex, is tightly associated with cardiac development. However, little is known about the association between the pathogenesis of CHD and BRG1. The methylation of a BRG1 promoter and a novel CpG island in the second intron was analyzed in the myocardium of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients (n = 24) and normal controls (n = 11) using pyrosequencing and the MassARRAY platform. BRG1 expression was sketched in the normal fetal and postnatal heart using real-time PCR. BRG1 mRNA and protein expression was detected by means of real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The expression of GATA4 was analyzed with real-time PCR. The CpG shore in the second intron of BRG1 was hypomethylated in the myocardium of patients (p < 0.05). BRG1 showed a high level of expression in the normal fetal heart in the second trimester (p < 0.01). Compared with that of the normal subjects, BRG1 expression was decreased by 70% in the myocardium of patients (n = 92; p < 0.05). Of note, the expression of GATA4 was significantly correlated with BRG1 expression (r = 0.7475; p = 0.0082) in the myocardium, and it was also decreased by 70% in these patients (n = 92; p < 0.05). These results suggested that the early high expression of BRG1 in fetal hearts maintained normal cardiac development and that the abnormal hypomethylation and decreased expression of BRG1 in human hearts probably affect the expression of GATA4, which affects the pathogenesis of CHD.

      "The phenotypic variability in cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely recognized and modulated by environmental and genetic factors, including CFTR pathogenic variants and modifier genes genetic variants. In this context, determining the presence of variants in genes involved in immune response may allow a better understanding of CF variability, mainly in lung disease. Thus, ADIPOQ and STATH genes were selected and the analysis of exons and exon/intron junctions was performed for the determination of variations in its sequence, to determine the possible genetic modulation. A total of 49 patients with CF, diagnosed for showing abnormal [chloride] levels in the sweat test, and identification of two pathogenic variants in CFTR categorized as class I and II were included. Genetic sequencing was performed for the identification of variants in the modifier genes. In our analysis, there was absence of rare genetic variants in STATH and ADIPOQ genes associated with the clinical variability. Thus, we are not able to establish an association between the disease severity and rare genetic variants in STATH and ADIPOQ genes, considering exons and exon/intron junctions. Considering the negative screening for rare genetic variants in ADIPOQ and STATH genes, it may be concluded that these genes are not associated with phenotypic modulation of CF in our population. To understand the modifier genes and its action at CF variability it is essential to promote a better overview of the disease. Also, negative reports can help to direct new studies without the use of unnecessary financial support.\n",
      "Progressive lung damage causes most deaths in cystic fibrosis (CF). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent progressive pulmonary deterioration and morbidity in CF. To assess the effectiveness of treatment with NSAIDs in CF. We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted manufacturers of NSAIDs.Latest search of the Group's Trials Register: 15 May 2013. Randomized controlled trials comparing oral NSAIDs, at any dose for at least two months, to placebo in people with CF. Two authors independently assessed trials for the review. The searches identified eight trials; five are included (334 participants aged five to 39 years; maximum follow up of four years). Three trials compared ibuprofen to placebo (two from the same centre with some of the same participants); one trial assessed piroxicam versus placebo, a fifth trial compared cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor nimesulide and clarithromycin. The three ibuprofen trials were deemed to have good or adequate methodological quality, but used various outcomes and summary measures. Reviewers considered measures of lung function, nutritional status, radiological assessment of pulmonary involvement, intravenous antibiotic usage, hospital admissions, survival and adverse effects. Combined data from the two largest ibuprofen trials showed a significantly lower annual rate of decline for lung function, % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) mean difference (MD) 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.42); forced vital capacity (FVC) MD 1.27 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.28); forced expiratory flow (25-75%) MD 1.80 (95% CI 0.15 to 3.45). The post-hoc analysis of data from two trials split by age showed a statistically significant slower rate of annual decline of % predicted FEV1 and FVC in the ibuprofen group in younger children, MD 1.41% (95% CI 0.03 to 2.80) and MD 1.32% (95% CI 0.04 to 2.60) respectively. In one trial, long-term use of high-dose ibuprofen was associated with reduced intravenous antibiotic usage, improved nutritional and radiological pulmonary status. No major adverse effects were reported, but the power of the trials to identify clinically important differences in the incidence of adverse effects was low. High-dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in people with CF, especially in children, which suggests that strategies to modulate lung inflammation can be beneficial for people with CF.\n",
      "Introduction.Gene APOEε4 allele polymorphisms have been examined in Down syndrome because of the relationship between (a) the E4 isoform and (b) the type of Alzheimer's dementia that appears in individuals with Down syndrome. This isoform is considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease development and has been associated with early death in Down syndrome. Objectives. The polymorphisms in the APOE gene were characterized for Down syndrome individuals and their parents, in order to detect associations between the APOE polymorphisms and Down syndrome. Materials and methods. APOE gene polymorphisms were detected by RFLP-PCR and analyzed in 134 young individuals with Down syndrome, 87 mothers and 54 fathers, residents of the departments of Quindío and Risaralda, Colombia. The controls were 525 healthy individuals. Results. The APOEε3 allele and ε3/ε3 genotype were most frequent in all the populations (83-90% and 70-78%). The allelic frequency of APOEε2 was very low and ε2/ε2 (3-7%) was absent in Down syndrome and their parents. The allele APOEε4 was more frequent (11% vs. 9%) in Down syndrome individuals than in the controls. Comparing the allelic and genotypic frequencies between the populations with Down syndrome and their parents with the controls using Pearson c2 test and Fisher's exact test odds ratio, no statistically significant differences were found. Conclusions. No statistically significant association was found between the polymorphisms of the APOE gene and Down syndrome. Sample size or ethnic influences may have affected these results. More studies are necessary with other Colombian populations to determine possible associations in other genes related to Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Human genetic studies as well as studies in animal models indicate that lysosomal dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Among the lysosomal genes involved, GBA1 has the largest impact on Parkinson's disease risk. Deficiency in the GBA1 encoded enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) leads to the accumulation of the GCase glycolipid substrates glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine and ultimately results in toxicity and inflammation and negatively affect many clinical aspects of Parkinson's disease, including disease risk, the severity of presentation, age of onset, and likelihood of progression to dementia. These findings support the view that re-establishing normal levels of GCase enzyme activity may reduce the progression of Parkinson's disease in patients carrying GBA1 mutations. Studies in mouse models indicate that PR001, a AAV9 vector-based gene therapy designed to deliver a functional GBA1 gene to the brain, suggest that this therapeutic approach may slow or stop disease progression. PR001 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials with Parkinson's disease patients carrying GBA1 mutations.\n",
      "Understanding the function of genes mutated in hereditary forms of Parkinson's disease yields insight into disease etiology and reveals new pathways in cell biology. Although mutations or variants in many genes increase the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, only a handful of monogenic causes of parkinsonism have been identified. Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the products of two genes that are mutated in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, PINK1 and Parkin, normally work together in the same pathway to govern mitochondrial quality control, bolstering previous evidence that mitochondrial damage is involved in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, activates Parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and recruits Parkin to the dysfunctional mitochondrion. Then, Parkin ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to trigger selective autophagy. This review covers the normal functions that PINK1 and Parkin play within cells, their molecular mechanisms of action, and the pathophysiological consequences of their loss.\n",
      "Persistent rubella virus (RV) infection has been associated with various pathologies such as congenital rubella syndrome, Fuchs's uveitis, and cutaneous granulomas in patients with primary immune deficiencies (PID). Currently there are no drugs to treat RV infections. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA-approved drug for parasitic infections, and has been recently shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we found that empiric 2-month therapy with oral NTZ was associated in the decline/elimination of RV antigen from lesions in a PID patient with RV positive granulomas, while peginterferon treatment had no effect. In addition, we characterized the effects of NTZ on cell culture models of persistent RV infection. NTZ significantly inhibited RV replication in a primary culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Vero and A549 epithelial cell lines in a dose dependent manner with an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.35 μg/ml (1.1 μM). RV strains representing currently circulating genotypes were inhibited to a similar extent. NTZ affected early and late stages of infection by inhibiting synthesis of cellular and RV RNA and interfering with intracellular trafficking of the RV surface glycoproteins, E1 and E2. These results suggest a potential application of NTZ for the treatment of persistent rubella infections, but more studies are required.\n",
      "The incidence of syphilis in the United States is increasing; it is estimated that more than 55,000 new infections will occur in 2014. Treatment regimens are controversial, especially in specific populations, and assessing treatment response based on serology remains a challenge. To review evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens, implications of the \"serofast state,\" and treatment of specific populations including those with neurosyphilis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pregnant women. We searched MEDLINE for English-language human treatment studies dating from January 1965 until July 2014. The American Heart Association classification system was used to rate quality of evidence. We included 102 articles in our review, consisting of randomized trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies. Case reports and small series were excluded unless they were the only studies providing evidence for a specific treatment strategy. We included 11 randomized trials. Evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens was reviewed from studies involving 11,102 patients. Data on the treatment of early syphilis support the use of a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million U of benzathine penicillin G, with studies reporting 90% to 100% treatment success rates. The value of multiple-dose treatment of early syphilis is uncertain, especially in HIV-infected individuals. Less evidence is available regarding therapy for late and late latent syphilis. Following treatment, nontreponemal serologic titers should decline in a stable pattern, but a significant proportion of patients may remain seropositive (the \"serofast state\"). Serologic response to treatment should be evident by 6 months in early syphilis but is generally slower (12-24 months) for latent syphilis. Evidence defining treatment for HIV-infected persons and for pregnant women is limited, but available data support penicillin as first-line therapy. The mainstay of syphilis treatment is parenteral penicillin G despite the relatively modest clinical trial data that support its use.\n",
      "Adriamycin (ADR) resistance is an obstacle for chemotherapy of breast cancer (BC). ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) expression is indicated to be closely related to the drug resistance of cancer cells. The current work intended to explore the molecular mechanisms to regulate ABCB1 in BC cells with ADR resistance. We found that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) is upregulated in ADR resistant BC cell lines (MCF-7/ADR, MDA-MB-231/ADR). A1BG-AS1 knockdown enhanced the ADR sensitivity by suppressing the viability, proliferation potential and migration ability, and facilitating cell apoptosis in BC. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is known to be an m6A reader to modulate the stability of mRNA transcripts in an m6A-dependent manner, which was a shared RNA binding protein (RBP) for A1BG-AS1 and ABCB1. The interaction of IGF2BP2 with A1BG-AS1 or ABCB1 was explored and verified using RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. ABCB1 mRNA and protein expression was positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 and IGF2BP2 in BC cells. ABCB1 mRNA expression was stabilized by A1BG-AS1 via recruiting IGF2BP2 in an m6A-dependent manner. Moreover, rescue assays demonstrated that A1BG-AS1 enhanced BC ADR resistance by positively modulating ABCB1. Xenograft mouse models were used to explore whether A1BG-AS1 affected the ADR resistance in BC in vivo. The findings indicated that A1BG-AS1 silencing inhibited tumor growth and alleviated ADR resistance in vivo. In conclusion, A1BG-AS1 enhances the ADR resistance of BC by recruiting IGF2BP2 to upregulate ABCB1 in an m6A-dependent manner.\n",
      "APOO/MIC26 is a subunit of the MICOS complex required for mitochondrial cristae morphology and function. Here, we report a novel variant of the APOO/MIC26 gene that causes a severe mitochondrial disease with overall progeria-like phenotypes in two patients. Both patients developed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral congenital cataract, hypothyroidism, and severe immune deficiencies. The patients died at an early age of 12 or 18 months. Exome sequencing revealed a mutation (NM_024122.5): c.532G>T (p.E178*) in the APOO/MIC26 gene that causes a nonsense mutation leading to the loss of 20 C-terminal amino acids. This mutation resulted in a highly unstable and degradation prone MIC26 protein, yet the remaining minute amounts of mutant MIC26 correctly localized to mitochondria and interacted physically with other MICOS subunits. MIC26 KO cells expressing MIC26 harboring the respective APOO/MIC26 mutation showed mitochondria with perturbed cristae architecture and fragmented morphology resembling MIC26 KO cells. We conclude that the novel mutation found in the APOO/MIC26 gene is a loss-of-function mutation impairing mitochondrial morphology and cristae morphogenesis.\n",
      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is marked by hepatic fat accumulation and reflects a spectrum of chronic liver diseases associated with obesity, impaired insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia. Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the plasma apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and electron transport activity of the mitochondrium. However, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Based on our previous data in a non-mammalian experimental system [1], we hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones and oxidative stress. To gain insight into a mammalian experimental system, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells with those in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Incubation of the cells with BSA-complexed oleic acid (OA-Alb) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with in-house produced rabbit anti-ApoO antisera demonstrated significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. ROS formation due to OA-Alb treatment was only slightly altered in LMH cells, indicating an intact antioxidant defense system of the cells. Oxidative stress applied by addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> revealed induction of ApoO transcript and protein level in the same or even higher extent as monitored in the presence of OA-Alb. Upon treatment with estrogen for 24 h quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein revealed increases of ApoO expression supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism at various points. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA-Alb. Therefore, we assume that our findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n",
      "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to modulate cardiovascular diseases, and expression dynamics of lncRNAs in the bloodstream were proposed to be potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. However, few cardiovascular diseases-related circulating lncRNAs were identified and their prediction power has not been investigated in depth. Here we report a new circulating lncRNA, <i>atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis associated transcript</i> (<i>APPAT</i>), and evaluated its role and predicting ability in atherosclerotic development. <i>APPAT</i> was analyzed and screened by high-throughput sequencing, and then detected <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH) was utilized to explore distribution and subcellular location of <i>APPAT</i>. The expressing alteration of <i>APPAT</i> in samples of healthy and pathological coronary artery was explored further. We also assessed the level of circulating <i>APPAT</i> in blood samples from healthy individuals, and patients with angina pectoris (AP) or myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, we predicted and validated microRNA targets of <i>APPAT</i>, then showed the expression level of a candidate target which was primarily measured in human VSMCs cell line, coronary artery, and blood samples. Lastly, we examined the potential indicating ability of <i>APPAT</i> for the risk of AP or MI. <i>APPAT</i> showed significant reduction in ox-LDL treated human VSMCs <i>in vitro</i>. It enriched in contractile VSMCs of artery tunica media and mainly existed in cytoplasm. Significant down-regulation of <i>APPAT</i> was found in coronary artery samples with severe stenosis. More importantly, we observed decreased expression of <i>APPAT</i> in blood samples accompanying disease progression. ROC and correlation analyses further verified the relatively high predicting ability of <i>APPAT</i>. We also observed the predicted miRNA exhibited opposite expression direction to that of <i>APPAT</i>. This study revealed that circulating lncRNA-<i>APPAT</i> may perform an important function and have some indicating ability on the development of atherosclerosis.\n",
      "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a vital role in immunity to tubercle bacillus and its gene polymorphisms are supposed to affect tuberculosis susceptibility in some rather than all studies. Then, we integrated published data and performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to get more reliable estimations for the strength of associations between TLR4 gene polymorphisms and the risk of tuberculosis. We systematically searched the electronic PubMed database for research articles about TLR4 gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis up to February 2012. Revman 5.0 software was adopted to conduct the meta-analysis. Crude odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by either fixed-effects model or random-effects model. Finally, six case-control studies were identified, involving 1587 controls and 2110 patients. Overall, no significant associations were found between TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism and tuberculosis in the codominant models (GG vs AA: OR=1.56, 95% CI=0.76-3.21, P=0.23; GA vs AA: OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.84-1.23, P=0.89), the dominant model (GG+GA vs AA: OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.80-1.35, P=0.75), the recessive model (GG vs GA+AA: OR=1.55, 95% CI=0.75-3.19, P=0.24) and the allele model (G vs A: OR=1.06, 95% CI=0.81-1.40, P=0.66). Similarly, no significant associations between TLR4 gene Thr399Ile and tuberculosis were observed (all P>0.05). The present meta-analysis suggests that TLR4 gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms are not associated with the susceptibility of tuberculosis.\n",
      "Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) has been reported to play an important role as a key enzyme in the lectin pathway of the complement system. The objectives of our study were to determine whether the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of MASP2 and the gene-tea drinking interaction were associated with the susceptibility to TB. In total, 503 patients and 494 healthy controls were contained. Three SNPs (rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659) were genotyped. The association between the SNPs and susceptibility to TB were investigated by conducting multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis. The gene-tea drinking interactions were analyzed by the additive model of marginal structural linear odds models. Both genotype AC + AA at rs12711521 of MASP2 genes and genotype GT + GG at rs7548659 of MASP2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (OR: 1.423 and 1.439, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between tea drinking and rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs7548659 of MASP2 genes was found to suggest negative interactions, which reached - 0.2311 (95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.4736, - 0.0113), - 0.7080 (95% CI - 1.3998, - 0.0163), and - 0.5140 (95% CI - 0.8988, - 0.1291), respectively (P < 0.05). Our finding indicated that the SNPs (rs12711521 and rs7548659) of MASP2 were associated with the susceptibility to TB. Furthermore, there were negative interactions between tea drinking and rs12142107, rs12711521, and rs75548659 of MASP2 gene, respectively. Our research provides a basis for studying the pathogenesis and prevention of tuberculosis.\n",
      "Many case-control studies have been performed in the past to elucidate the association between the P2X7 receptor 1513 A>C (rs3751143) polymorphism and tuberculosis (TB) risk. However, their data interpretation was difficult due to scattered and inconsistent results that led to limited power. In this study, a quantitative summary assessment has been done through meta-analysis to appraise the association between the 1513 A>C polymorphism and TB susceptibility. Systematic assessment was performed for the published studies related with the association between the P2X7 1513 A>C polymorphism and TB risk retrieved from PubMed (Medline), EMBASE search. A meta-analysis was done using a statistical program to evaluate the said association. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for allele contrast, homozygous, heterozygous, dominant, and recessive genetic models. A total of 2710 controls and 2521 TB cases were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis results showed that C allele carrier status was significantly associated with increased TB risk (C vs. A: p=0.001; OR=1.382, 95% CI=1.248-1.531). Significant risk of TB was associated with the homozygous mutant CC (CC vs. AA: p=0.001; OR=1.676, 95% CI=1.251-2.247) and heterozygous AC (AC vs. AA: p=0.001; OR=1.429, 95% CI=1.260-1.621) comparisons. Similarly, dominant (CC vs. AA+AC: p=0.008; OR=1.481, 95% CI=1.109-1.978) and recessive (CC+AC vs. AA: p=0.001; OR=1.458, 95% CI=1.292-1.645) genetic models also revealed increased risk of developing TB. We found that the P2X7 1513 A>C gene polymorphism is significantly associated with increased susceptibility to TB. Also, future well-designed epidemiological studies with stratified case-control and biological characterization may be beneficial to validate these findings.\n",
      "Hypertension is the leading risk factor contributing to mortality worldwide, primarily from cardiovascular disease (CVD), while effective treatment of hypertension is proven to reduce CVD events. Along with the well recognized nutrition and lifestyle determinants, genetic factors are implicated in the development and progression of hypertension. In recent years genome-wide association studies have identified a region near the gene encoding the folate-metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) among eight loci associated with blood pressure. Epidemiological studies, which provide a separate line of evidence to link this gene with blood pressure, show that the 677C→T polymorphism in MTHFR increases the risk of hypertension by 24-87% and CVD by up to 40%, albeit with a large geographical variation in the extent of excess disease risk suggestive of a gene-environment interaction. Emerging evidence indicates that the relevant environmental factor may be riboflavin, the MTHFR co-factor, via a novel and genotype-specific effect on blood pressure. Randomized trials conducted in hypertensive patients (with and without overt CVD) pre-screened for this polymorphism show that targeted riboflavin supplementation in homozygous individuals (MTHFR 677TT genotype) lowers systolic blood pressure by 6 to 13 mmHg, independently of the effect of antihypertensive drugs. The latest evidence, that the blood pressure phenotype associated with this polymorphism is modifiable by riboflavin, has important clinical and public health implications. For hypertensive patients, riboflavin supplementation can offer a non-drug treatment to effectively lower blood pressure in those identified with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. For sub-populations worldwide with this genotype, better riboflavin status may prevent or delay the development of high blood pressure. Thus riboflavin, targeted at those homozygous for a common polymorphism in MTHFR, may offer a personalized treatment or preventative strategy for hypertension. Further investigations of this novel gene-nutrient interaction in relation to blood pressure, hypertension and hypertension in pregnancy are required.\n",
      "The association of the high blood pressure D variant of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene with medication-related jaw osteonecrosis (MRONJ) is described in two Greek patients. The first patient, a 73-year-old man, took zolendronate, 4 mg/100 ml IV once per month for two years for prostate cancer and bone metastases. Three months after drug discontinuation, extraction of the first premolar was performed. After the intervention, he suffered from osteonecrosis of the mandible. He presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that he was homozygous for the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene. The second patient, a 65 years old woman, took denosumab, 120 mg subcutaneously once per month for 6 months for possible bone metastases from breast cancer. Three months after extraction of the first molar, she suffered from MRONJ. He also presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that she had the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene in a heterozygous state, which moderately predisposes to hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that genetic predisposition to hypertension may increase risk for MRONJ.\n",
      "The hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection causes acute hepatitis. HAV also induces acute liver failure or acute-on-chronic liver failure; however, no potent anti-HAV drugs are currently available in clinical situations. For anti-HAV drug screening, more convenient and useful models that mimic HAV replication are needed. In the present study, we established HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells, which are HuhT7 cells stably expressing the HAV HM175-18f genotype IB subgenomic replicon RNA harboring the firefly luciferase gene. This system was made by using a PiggyBac-based gene transfer system that introduces nonviral transposon DNA into mammalian cells. Then, we investigated whether 1134 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs exhibited in vitro anti-HAV activity. We further demonstrated that treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor masitinib significantly reduced both HAV HM175-18f genotype IB replication and HAV HA11-1299 genotype IIIA replication. Masitinib also significantly inhibited HAV HM175 internal ribosomal entry-site (IRES) activity. In conclusion, HuhT7-HAV/Luc cells are adequate for anti-HAV drug screening, and masitinib may be useful for the treatment of severe HAV infection.\n",
      "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) commonly causes a chronic infection but few of patients are able to clear the virus naturally. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the immune response against HCV. Interindividual variations in IL-10 production are genetically contributed by polymorphisms within the IL-10 promoter region. This study aimed to investigate the association of the IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G/A, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A polymorphisms with HCV infection susceptibility in Pakistani individuals. Eighty-nine chronically infected patients and 99 controls were enrolled in the study. IL-10 (-1,082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A) genotyping was performed by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). A suggestive evidence of association with hepatitis C was obtained for the IL-10 -819 C/T (-592 C/A) (p: 0.03) promoter polymorphism at the allele level  but not in genotype distribution. The IL-10 -1082 allele showed no association while positive association of GG (p: 0.001) gene and negative association for GA (0.001) gene were observed.  Higher frequencies were observed for GTA (p: 0.02), ACC (p: 0.01) haplotype and GCC/GTA (p: 0.005) diplotype in HCV patients than controls while diplotype GCC/ATA showed protective effect against HCV. Our findings suggest that different IL-10 gene polymorphisms may lead to an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses which may in turn influence the susceptibility to HCV infection.\n",
      "Chronic hepatitis C remains one of the most urgent problems of today's medicine. The review unravels the current view of the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) gene in different aspects of hepatitis C virus infection. Major attention is paid to the discussion of the value of the allelic variants of IL-28B during standard double and current triple antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, the paper covers the biological role of interferon-lambda, a product of IL-28A, B, and IL-29 gene expression, other associations of the allelic variants of the IL-28B gene with different clinical signs, as well as the possibilities of practical use of this genetic marker in chronic hepatitis C today and futures prospects.\n",
      "Lecanemab (BAN2401), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, preferentially targets soluble aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ), with activity across oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils. BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. BAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly. BAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints. A phase 3 study (Clarity AD) in early Alzheimer's disease is underway. Clinical Trials.gov NCT01767311 .\n",
      "Development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been challenging, with no drugs approved to date. The failures of several amyloid-targeted programs have led many to dismiss the amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis of AD. An antiamyloid antibody aducanumab recently showed modest but significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial, providing important validation of amyloid as a therapeutic target. However, the inconsistent results observed with aducanumab may be explained by the limited brain penetration and lack of selectivity for the soluble Aβ oligomers, which are implicated as upstream drivers of neurodegeneration by multiple studies. Development of agents that can effectively inhibit Aβ oligomer formation or block their toxicity is therefore warranted. An ideal drug would cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently and achieve sustained brain levels that can continuously prevent oligomer formation or inhibit their toxicity. A late-stage candidate with these attributes is ALZ-801, an oral drug with a favorable safety profile and high brain penetration that can robustly inhibit Aβ oligomer formation. An upcoming phase 3 trial with ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 homozygous patients with early AD will effectively test this amyloid oligomer hypothesis.\n",
      "25% of all people aged 55 years and older have a family history of dementia. For most, the family history is due to genetically complex disease, where many genetic variations of small effect interact to increase risk of dementia. The lifetime risk of dementia for these families is about 20%, compared with 10% in the general population. A small proportion of families have an autosomal dominant family history of early-onset dementia, which is often due to mendelian disease, caused by a mutation in one of the dementia genes. Each family member has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, which confers a lifetime dementia risk of over 95%. In this Review, we focus on the evidence for, and the approach to, genetic testing in Alzheimer's disease (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes), frontotemporal dementia (MAPT, GRN, C9ORF72, and other genes), and other familial dementias. We conclude by discussing the practical aspects of genetic counselling.\n",
      "Long-term or severe lack of protective factors is important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementia. Progranulin (PGRN), a neurotrophic factor expressed mainly in neurons and microglia, has various neuroprotective effects such as anti-inflammatory effects, promoting neuron survival and neurite growth, and participating in normal lysosomal function. Mutations in the PGRN gene (GRN) have been found in several neurodegenerative dementias, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, PGRN deficiency and PGRN hydrolytic products (GRNs) in the pathological changes related to dementia, including aggregation of tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), amyloid-β (Aβ) overproduction, neuroinflammation, lysosomal dysfunction, neuronal death, and synaptic deficit have been summarized. Furthermore, as some therapeutic strategies targeting PGRN have been developed in various models, we highlighted PGRN as a potential anti-neurodegeneration target in dementia.\n",
      "Strong evidence supports the involvement of sex steroid hormones in the development and progression of dementia. Attention has been largely focused on the association between genetic variants of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα, ESR1) with dementia, although several studies indicate that ERβ is predominantly expressed in the brain. Interestingly, however, a limited number of studies evaluate the role of ERβ (ESR2) in dementia. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the association between ESR2 genetic polymorphisms and the risk of dementia. All the relevant studies evaluating ESR2 genetic polymorphisms and dementia were identified through online databases. In total, 14 studies including 20,609 subjects were analyzed. Collectively, it was found that a combined data set of ESR2 polymorphisms was not associated with dementia risk. Interestingly, ESR2 rs4986938 polymorphism is significantly associated with dementia in the Asian population (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91, P = 0.006). The carrier of A allele in rs4986938 exhibits a protective effect against dementia (A vs. G, OR = 0.6633, P = 0.012; AA + GA vs. GG, OR = 0.6499, P = 0.014; GA vs. AA + GG, OR = 0.6672, P = 0.025; GA vs. GG, OR = 0.6617, P = 0.022). In conclusion, our study suggests that ESR2 genetic polymorphisms are not significantly associated with dementia risk. ESR2 rs4986938 may have potential as a genetic marker for dementia in the Asian population. However, further studies need to verify this conclusion.\n",
      "There are several theories regarding the etiologies of Alzheimer disease (AD). Considering that all genes responsible for familial AD are amyloid protein precursor (APP) or APP metabolizing enzymes, surely aberrant APP metabolism is crucial to pathogenesis of AD. BRI2, a type II transmembrane protein, binds APP and inhibits all α, β, and γ pathways of APP proteolysis. Crossing AD model mice with BRI2 transgenic or BRI2 knockout mice confirmed that BRI2 is an anti-Alzheimer gene. Mutations of BRI2 are known to cause rare familial dementias in human. Analysis of knock-in mice harboring the disease mutation revealed the memory defect in the mice, attributable to loss of protective function of BRI2. Further studies are needed to decipher this anti-Alzheimer mechanism of BRI2 to develop a novel therapeutic application for AD. In this review, after describing basic assumptions in AD study, we focus on BRI2 as an anti-Alzheimer gene.\n",
      "The effect of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene polymorphisms on susceptibility of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were evaluated in ethnically different populations, whereas the results were always inconsistent. Fourteen articles involving 36 datasets were recruited to evaluate the association between MBL gene polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis in a meta-analysis. The random or fixed effect models were used to evaluate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Stratified analysis by ethnicities was conducted and the result revealed that rs1800450 (T vs C, OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.67, P < .05) and MBL-A/O (T vs C, OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08-1.34, P < .001) were strongly associated with RA in Brazilian populations. In addition, the significant relationship between rs11003125 (T vs C, OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.06-1.26, P < .05) with RA were also observed in East Asian populations. Meanwhile, the inverse associations between rs5030737 with RA in East Asians and rs1800450 with RA in Indians were acquired. However, no association between any MBL polymorphism with RA susceptibility was confirmed in Caucasians. The structural polymorphisms in exon 1 of MBL gene may significantly contribute to susceptibility and development of RA in Brazilian and Indian populations, whereas the functional polymorphisms in the promoter region were more likely to associate with RA in East Asians.\n",
      "PAX5, a transcription factor pivotal for B-cell commitment and maintenance, is one of the most frequent targets of somatic mutations in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A number of PAX5 rearrangements result in the expression of in-frame fusion genes encoding chimeric proteins, which at the N-terminus consistently retain the PAX5 DNA-binding paired domain fused to the C-terminal domains of a markedly heterogeneous group of fusion partners. PAX5 fusion proteins are thought to function as aberrant transcription factors, which antagonize wild-type PAX5 activity. To gain mechanistic insight into the role of PAX5 fusion proteins in leukemogenesis, the biochemical and functional properties of uncharacterized fusions: PAX5-DACH1, PAX5-DACH2, PAX5-ETV6, PAX5-HIPK1, and PAX5-POM121 were ascertained. Independent of the subcellular distribution of the wild-type partner proteins, ectopic expression of all PAX5 fusion proteins showed a predominant nuclear localization, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation all of the chimeric proteins exhibited binding to endogenous PAX5 target sequences. Furthermore, consistent with the presence of potential oligomerization motifs provided by the partner proteins, the self-interaction capability of several fusion proteins was confirmed. Remarkably, a subset of the PAX5 fusion proteins conferred CD79A promoter activity; however, in contrast with wild-type PAX5, the fusion proteins were unable to induce Cd79a transcription in a murine plasmacytoma cell line. These data show that leukemia-associated PAX5 fusion proteins share some dominating characteristics such as nuclear localization and DNA binding but also show distinctive features. This comparative study of multiple PAX5 fusion proteins demonstrates both common and unique properties, which likely dictate their function and impact on leukemia development.\n",
      "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disorder caused by extended trinucleotide CAG repetition in the HTT gene. Wild-type huntingtin protein (HTT) is essential, involved in a variety of crucial cellular functions such as vesicle transportation, cell division, transcription regulation, autophagy, and tissue maintenance. The mutant HTT (mHTT) proteins in the body interfere with HTT's normal cellular functions and cause additional detrimental effects. In this review, we discuss multiple approaches targeting DNA and RNA to reduce mHTT expression. These approaches are categorized into non-allele-specific silencing and allele-specific-silencing using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplogroup analysis. Additionally, this review discusses a potential application of recent CRISPR prime editing technology in targeting HD.\n",
      "An imbalance of nephroprotective factors and renal damaging molecules contributes to development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated associations of renoprotective factor gene expression patterns with CKD severity and outcome. Gene expression profiles of 197 previously reported renoprotective factors were analyzed in a discovery cohort in renal biopsies of 63 CKD patients. Downregulation of dicarbonyl and L-xylulose reductase (DCXR) showed the strongest association with disease progression. This significant association was validated in an independent set of 225 patients with nephrotic syndrome from the multicenter NEPTUNE cohort. Reduced expression of DCXR was significantly associated with degree of histological damage as well as with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and increased urinary protein levels. DCXR downregulation in CKD was confirmed in 3 publicly available transcriptomics data sets in the context of CKD. Expression of DCXR showed positive correlations to enzymes that are involved in dicarbonyl stress detoxification based on transcriptomics profiles. The sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors canagliflozin and empagliflozin showed a beneficial effect on renal proximal tubular cells under diabetic stimuli-enhanced DCXR gene expression. In summary, lower expression of the renoprotective factor DCXR in renal tissue is associated with more severe disease and worse outcome in human CKD.\n",
      "The tumor suppressor genes EAF2 and p53 are frequently dysregulated in prostate cancers. Recently, we reported that concurrent p53 nuclear staining and EAF2 downregulation were associated with high Gleason score. Combined loss of EAF2 and p53 in a murine model induced prostate tumors, and concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53 in prostate cancer cells enhanced proliferation and migration, further suggesting that EAF2 and p53 could functionally interact in the suppression of prostate tumorigenesis. Here, RNA-seq analyses identified differentially regulated genes in response to concurrent knockdown of p53 and EAF2. Several of these genes were associated with the STAT3 signaling pathway, and this was verified by significantly increased p-STAT3 immunostaining in the Eaf2<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>-/-</sup> mouse prostate. STAT3 knockdown abrogated the stimulation of C4-2 cell proliferation by concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53. Furthermore, immunostaining of p-STAT3 was increased in human prostate cancer specimens with EAF2 downregulation and/or p53 nuclear staining. Our findings suggest that simultaneous inactivation of EAF2 and p53 can act to activate STAT3 and drive prostate tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Osteoarthritis is a chronic age-related degenerative disease associated with varying degrees of pain and joint mobility disorders. Grb2-associated-Binding protein-2 (GAB2) is an intermediate molecule that plays a role downstream in a variety of signaling pathways, such as inflammatory signaling pathways. The role of GAB2 in the pathogenesis of OA has not been fully studied. In this study, we found that GAB2 expression was elevated in chondrocytes after constructing in vivo and in vitro models of OA. Inhibition of GAB2 by siRNA decreased the expression of MMP3, MMP13, iNOS, COX2, p62, and increased the expression of COL2, SOX9, ATG7, Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I. Furthermore, inhibition of GAB2 expression inhibited interleukin-1β (IL-1β) -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In vivo studies, we found that reduced GAB2 expression effectively delayed cartilage destruction in a mouse model of OA induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that GAB2 is a potential therapeutic target for OA.\n",
      "Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease that has an increasing death rate but no effective treatment to now. Although biological and immunological hallmarks of PDAC have been frequently reported recently, early detection and the particularly aggressive biological features are the major challenges remaining unclear. In the current study, we retrieved multiple scRNA-seq datasets and illustrated the genetic programs of PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. Notably, the transcription levels of Id1 were elevated specifically along with the PDAC development. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that Id1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. The gene expression patterns of human PDAC cells were determined by the comparative analysis of the scRNA-seq data on human PDAC and normal pancreas tissues. ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells were dramatically increased compared to normal epithelial cells. ID1 deficiency in vitro significantly blunt the invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. IPA analysis on the differentially expressed genes suggested that EIF2 signaling was the core pathway regulating the development of PDAC. Blocking EFI2 signaling remarkably decreased the expression of ID1 and attenuated the tumor-formation related phenotypes. These observations confirmed that ID1 was regulated by EIF2 signaling and was the critical determinator of PDAC development and progression. This study suggests that ID1 is a potential malignant biomarker of PDAC in both mouse models and human and detecting and targeting ID1 may be a promising strategy to treat or even rescue PDAC.\n",
      "The inhibitor of differentiation (Id) transcription regulators, which are induced in response to oxidative stress, promote cell proliferation and inhibit senescence. Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) expression is limited to endothelial cells (EC) in the normal mouse kidney and is required for a normal response to injury. Endothelial dysfunction leads to the development of diabetic nephropathy, and so, we hypothesized that endothelial Id1 may help protect against hyperglycemia-induced microvascular injury and nephropathy. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using streptozotocin to induce diabetes in Id1 knockout (KO) mice and WT B6;129 littermates and examining the mice at 3 months. Expression of Id1 was observed to be increased 15-fold in WT kidney EC, and Id1 KO mice exhibited increased mesangial and myofibroblast proliferation, matrix deposition, and albuminuria compared with WT mice. Electron microscopy demonstrated peritubular capillary EC injury and lumen narrowing, and fluorescence microangiography showed a 45% reduction in capillary perfusion area with no reduction in CD31-stained areas in Id1 KO mice. Microarray analysis of EC isolated from WT and KO control and diabetic mice demonstrated activation of senescence pathways in KO cells. Kidneys from KO diabetic mice showed increased histological expression of senescence markers. In addition, premature senescence in cultured KO EC was also seen in response to oxidative stress. In conclusion, endothelial Id1 upregulation with hyperglycemia protects against microvascular injury and senescence and subsequent nephropathy.\n",
      "We have recently described the identification of a second IDS locus (IDS-2) located within 90 kb telomeric of the IDS gene (Bondeson et al. submitted). Here, we show that this region is involved in a recombination event with the IDS gene in about 13% of patients with the Hunter syndrome. Analysis of the resulting rearrangement at the molecular level showed that these patients have suffered a recombination event that results in a disruption of the IDS gene in intron 7 with an inversion of the intervening DNA. Interestingly, all of the six cases with a similar type of rearrangement showed recombination between intron 7 of the IDS gene and sequences close to exon 3 at the IDS-2 locus implying that these regions are hot spots for recombination. Analysis by nucleotide sequencing showed that the inversion is caused by recombination between homologous sequences present in the IDS gene and the IDS-2 locus. No detectable deletions or insertions were observed as a result of the recombination event. The results in this study have practical implications for diagnosis of the Hunter syndrome.\n",
      "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance in pregnant women leading to various complications. Currently, there is a search for factors predisposing to GDM. Among them are genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in insulin secretion as well as carbohydrate metabolism. Due to the similar pathogenesis of GDM to type 2 diabetes (T2DM), genetic polymorphisms associated with T2DM are considered. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between the COBLL1 rs7607980 T > C and IRS1 rs2943641 T > C gene polymorphisms and the risk of GDM as well as selected clinical parameters in women with GDM. Additionally, we examined the expression of these genes in the placenta of women with and without GDM in correlation with selected clinical parameters. This study included 328 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 251 pregnant women with GDM diagnosed on the basis of a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24−28 weeks gestation. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of IRS1 rs2943641 gene polymorphisms between women with GDM and pregnant women with NGT. In the GDM group, we observed a decreased frequency of COBLL1 rs7607980 CC homozygous women (CC vs. TC+TT, p = 0.048); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of alleles between women with GDM and the control group. There were no statistically significant associations between COBLL1 rs7607980 gene polymorphism and clinical parameters in women with GDM. In GDM women with the IRS1 rs2943641 TT genotype, fasting glucose levels were significantly higher than in women with CC and TC genotypes. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of COBLL1 and IRS1 genes in the placenta between women with GDM and healthy women. There were no statistically significant correlations between COBLL1 gene expression in the placenta and clinical parameters. The expression of IRS1 correlated significantly with an increase in BMI during pregnancy. The results of this study suggest that COBLL1 rs7607980 and IRS1 rs2943641 gene polymorphisms are not significant risk factors for GDM in our population. The IRS1 TT genotype may be associated with higher fasting glucose levels in women with GDM. Expression of the IRS1 gene in the placenta positively correlates with an increase in BMI during pregnancy in women with GDM.\n",
      "Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), plays a critical role in insulin signaling and its control has an important place in the development of insulin resistance. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 serves as docking molecules for downstream effectors such as Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase-2. We focused on the Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants of the IRS1 gene, since these specific allelic variants are located near the Tyr-Met-X-Met (YMXM) motifs around Tyr987 and Tyr612. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphisms in IRS1 gene on development of insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a non-obese Turkish population. This work included 306 individuals comprising 178 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 128 healthy subjects matched for body mass index. Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphisms had no effect on type 2 diabetes risk and its phenotypes (P > 0.05). Although IRS1 gene and its variants are associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in several studies worldwide, our data showed that there is no association between Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants in IRS1 and disease in Turkish population.\n",
      "The associations of 4 proteins-AK4, ITPK1, HSPB2, and IGFBP5-with cognitive function in older adults were largely unexplained by known brain pathologies. We examined the extent to which individual protein associations with cognitive decline were attributable to microstructural changes in the brain. This study included 521 participants (mean age 90.3, 65.9-108.3) with the postmortem reciprocal of transverse relaxation time (R<sub>2</sub>) magnetic resonance image. All participants came from one of the 2 ongoing longitudinal cohorts of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. Higher abundance of AK4, HSPB2, and IGFBP5 was associated with faster cognitive decline and mediated through lower postmortem R<sub>2</sub> in the frontal and temporal white matter regions. In contrast, higher abundance of ITPK1 was associated with slower cognitive decline and mediated through higher postmortem R<sub>2</sub> in the frontal and temporal white matter regions. The associations of 4 proteins-AK4, ITPK1, IGFBP5, and HSPB2-with cognition in late life were explained via microstructural changes in the brain.\n",
      "<b>Introduction</b>: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease characterized by synovitis as well as symmetric and destructive arthropathy. Although several disease modified antirheumatic-drugs (DMARDs) have widely used in clinical practice, certain patients are nonresponsive to or cannot take such medications due to adverse reactions. It is evident that Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have the potential to provide a significant breakthrough in the treatment of RA. These potent, orally administered, JAK inhibitors simplify the treatment options for patients. <b>Areas covered</b>: We discuss the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of peficitinib for the treatment of RA. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Peficitinib is a novel JAK3 inhibitor potently inhibiting JAK3 enzymatic activity and JAK1/3-mediated cell proliferation. Its selectivity for JAK family kinases is similar to that of tofacitinib, but slightly less potent for JAK2. It is currently being evaluated by the FDA to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who show inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate. It can be used either as monotherapy or combination therapy with methotrexate, or other DMARDs. However, we think that more cautious consideration and measurement for adverse events are needed, after considering the safety results of ongoing clinical studies of peficitinib.\n",
      "Constitutively activated tyrosine kinase JAK3 is implicated in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). The mechanisms of constitutive JAK3 activation are unknown although a <i>JAK3</i> mutation was reported in a small portion of CTCL patients. In this study, we assessed the oncogenic roles of a newly identified <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript in CTCL. Total RNA from malignant T-cells in 33 patients with Sézary syndrome (SS), a leukemic form of CTCL, was examined for the new <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript by RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. The expression levels were assessed by qPCR and correlated with patient survivals. Knockdown and/or knockout assays were conducted in two CTCL cell lines (MJ cells and HH cells) by RNA interference and/or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. SS patients expressed heterogeneous levels of a new <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript. Patients with high-level expression of <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> showed poorer 5-year survival (n = 19, 42.1%) than patients with low-level expression (n = 14, 78.6%). CTCL cells transduced with specific shRNAs or sgRNAs had decreased new <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript expression, reduced cell proliferation, and decreased colony formation. In NSG xenograft mice, smaller tumor sizes were observed in MJ cells transduced with specific shRNAs than cells transduced with controls. Our results suggest that the newly identified <i>JAK3-INSL3</i> fusion transcript confers an oncogenic event in CTCL.\n",
      "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ranks as one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the prominence and effectiveness of kinase-target therapies in NSCLC treatment, these drugs are suitable for and beneficial to a mere ~30% of NSCLC patients. Consequently, the need for novel strategies addressing NSCLC remains pressing. Deubiquitinases (DUBs), a group of diverse enzymes with well-defined catalytic sites that are frequently overactivated in cancers and associated with tumorigenesis and regarded as promising therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which DUBs promote NSCLC remain poorly understood. Through a global analysis of the 97 DUBs' contribution to NSCLC survival possibilities using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that high expression of Josephin Domain-containing protein 2 (JOSD2) predicted the poor prognosis of patients. Depletion of JOSD2 significantly impeded NSCLC growth in both cell/patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Mechanically, we found that JOSD2 restricts the kinase activity of LKB1, an important tumor suppressor generally inactivated in NSCLC, by removing K6-linked polyubiquitination, an action vital for maintaining the integrity of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex. Notably, we identified the first small-molecule inhibitor of JOSD2, and observed that its pharmacological inhibition significantly arrested NSCLC proliferation in vitro/in vivo. Our findings highlight the vital role of JOSD2 in hindering LKB1 activity, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting JOSD2 in NSCLC, especially in those with inactivated LKB1, and presenting its inhibitors as a promising strategy for NSCLC treatment.\n",
      "The standard-of-care for metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Acquired resistance that occurs frequently through unidentified mechanisms, however, remains the major obstacle for implementing therapeutic effectiveness. Here, using data mining and analysis on clinical samples, we show that expression of JUND, a core component of activator protein-1 family, was significantly induced in cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant MIBC. Accumulation of nuclear JUND was associated with low post-chemotherapy survival in MIBC patients. In both genetically engineered cell models and murine xenograft models, we provided evidence that bladder cancer (BC) cells with excessive JUND expression were less responsive to CDDP treatment. This CDDP resistance was further demonstrated to be mediated, at least in part, by transactivation of HMOX1 [the gene encoding heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], one of the most important antioxidant signalling pathways of cell adaptation to stress. One mutation within the HMOX1 promoter successfully abolished oxidative stress-enhanced and JUND-driven HMOX1 promoter activation, suggesting that this unique site synergized for maximal HO-1 induction in CDDP-challenged BC cells. Overall, our data highlight an indispensible role of JUND, both as a target as a modifier of the oxidative stress signalling, in conferring an adaptive response during the pathogenesis of CDDP resistance in MIBC.\n",
      "Primary non-response and secondary loss of response remain a significant issue with the currently available treatment options for a significant proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are multiple unmet needs in the IBD treatment algorithm and new treatment options are required. As our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD evolves, new therapeutic targets are being identified. The JAK-STAT pathway has been extensively studied. Tofacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, is now licensed for use in the induction and maintenance of ulcerative colitis and there are a large number of molecules currently under investigation. These new small molecule drugs (SMDs) will challenge current treatment pathways at a time when clinical therapeutic outcomes are rapidly evolving and becoming more ambitious. This is a review of the current JAK1 inhibitors in IBD including the current evidence from clinical trials.\n",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by joint involvement, extra-articular manifestations, comorbidities, and increased mortality. In the last few decades, the management of RA has been dramatically improved by the introduction of a treat-to-target approach aiming to prevent joint damage progression. Moreover, the increasing knowledge about disease pathogenesis allowed the development of a new drug class of biologic agents targeted on immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines involved in RA network. Despite the introduction of several targeted drugs, a significant proportion of RA patients still fail to achieve the clinical target; so, more recently the focus of research has been shifted toward the inhibition of kinases involved in the transduction of the inflammatory signal into immune cells. In particular, two Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, baricitinib and tofacitinib, have been licensed for the treatment of RA as a consequence of a very favorable profile observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted across different RA subpopulations. Both these new compounds are active on the majority of four JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2), whereas the most recent emerging approach is directed toward the development of JAK1 selective inhibitors (upadacitinib and filgotinib) with the aim to improve the safety profile by minimizing the effects on JAK3 and, especially, JAK2. In this narrative review, we discuss the rationale for JAK inhibition in RA, with a special focus on the role of JAK1 selective blockade and a detailed description of available data from the results of clinical trials on upadacitinib and filgotinib.\n",
      "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), one of the most common epilepsies in children, is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. One of the genes responsible for human CAE associated with tonic-clonic seizures has been mapped to chromosome band 8q24 by genetic linkage analysis and is termed ECA1. Recently, we isolated and mapped the JRK/JH8 gene, a human homologue of the mouse epilepsy gene, jerky, on 8q24. The epilepsy phenotype of the mice with inactivated jerky gene as well as its chromosomal localization proposed JRK/JH8 as a prominent candidate for the CAE gene. To confirm whether the JRK/JH8 gene is responsible for ECA1, we performed mutational analyses in the coding region of JRK/JH8 in two CAE families mapped on 8q24, using heteroduplex and direct sequencing methods. We identified seven nucleotide changes, two of which lead to amino acid substitutions. However, these changes did not co-segregate with the disease phenotype. In addition, we redefined the location of JRK/JH8 to be more than 4 Mb distant from D8S502 and ECA1. Thus, negative results of mutation analyses and detailed physical mapping exclude JRK/JH8 as the ECA1 gene.\n",
      "Junctophilin-2 (JPH2) is a cardiac specific member of the junctophilins, a newly characterized family of junctional membrane complex proteins important in physically approximating the plasmalemmal L-type calcium channel and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor for calcium-induced calcium release. JPH2 knockout mice showed disrupted calcium transients, altered junctional membrane complex formation, cardiomyopathy, and embryonic lethality. Furthermore, JPH2 gene expression is down-regulated in murine cardiomyopathy models. To this end, we explored JPH2 as a novel candidate gene for the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in humans. Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing, comprehensive open reading frame/splice site mutational analysis of JPH2 was performed on DNA obtained from 388 unrelated patients with HCM. HCM-associated JPH2 mutations were engineered and functionally characterized using immunocytochemistry, cell morphometry measurements, and live cell confocal calcium imaging. Three novel HCM-susceptibility mutations: S101R, Y141H and S165F, which localize to key functional domains, were discovered in 3/388 unrelated patients with HCM and were absent in 1000 ethnic-matched reference alleles. Functionally, each human mutation caused (i) protein reorganization of junctophilin-2, (ii) perturbations in intracellular calcium signaling, and (iii) marked cardiomyocyte hyperplasia. The molecular and functional evidence implicates defective junctophilin-2 and disrupted calcium signaling as a novel pathogenic mechanism for HCM and establishes HCM as the first human disease associated with genetic defects in JPH2. Whether susceptibility for other cardiomyopathies, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, can be conferred by mutations in JPH2 warrants investigation.\n",
      "Paediatric neurology syndromes are a broad and complex group of conditions with a large spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Joubert syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous neurological ciliopathy syndrome with molar tooth sign as the neuroimaging hallmark. We reviewed the clinical, radiological and genetic data for several families with a clinical diagnosis of Joubert syndrome but negative genetic analysis. We detected biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>LAMA1</i>, including novel alleles, in each of the four cases we report, thereby establishing a firm diagnosis of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Analysis of brain MRI revealed cerebellar dysplasia and cerebellar cysts, associated with Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome and the absence of typical molar tooth signs. Using large UK patient cohorts, the relative prevalence of Joubert syndrome as a cause of intellectual disability was 0.2% and of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome was 0.02%. We conclude that children with congenital brain disorders that mimic Joubert syndrome may have a delayed diagnosis due to poor recognition of key features on brain imaging and the lack of inclusion of <i>LAMA1</i> on molecular genetic gene panels. We advocate the inclusion of <i>LAMA1</i> genetic analysis on all intellectual disability and Joubert syndrome gene panels and promote a wider awareness of the clinical and radiological features of these syndromes.\n",
      "To investigate <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>LAMA1</i> gene polymorphisms in children with high myopia in order to determine the genetic basis of large myopic shifts causing severe visual impairment and complications. Seventy-four children with high myopia (≥6 diopters [D]; study group) and 77 emmetropic children (±0.5D; control group) were included. Genetic and polymorphism analyses were performed in the Medical Genetics Laboratory using DNA purified from the patients' blood samples. Mean ages of the patients were 7.1±3 (3-13) and 9.6±1.8 (6-13) years in the study and control groups, respectively. Mean refraction in the high myopia group were -10.1±4.3D in the right and -8.9±3.6D in the left eye. <i>LAMA1</i> gene analysis of the study group revealed heterozygous mutations in 34 patients (45.9%), homozygous mutations in 25 patients (33.8%), and no mutations in the remaining 15 patients (20.3%). In the control group, there were 31 subjects (40.3%) with heterozygous, 27 (35.1%) with homozygous <i>LAMA1</i> mutations, and no mutations in 19 (24.7%) (p=0.73). <i>TGFB1</i> gene analysis showed heterozygous mutations in 32 (43.2%) and homozygous mutations in 10 patients (13.5%) in the study group, while 32 patients (43.2%) had no mutations. In the control group, 35 subjects (45.5%) had heterozygous, 8 (10.4%) had homozygous, and 34 (44.1%) had no <i>TGFB1</i> mutations (p=0.36). This is the first study to simultaneously examine two genes in high myopia in a Turkish population. However, we observed no significant differences in <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>LAMA1</i> gene polymorphisms in patients with high myopia compared to healthy subjects.\n",
      "Our previous work indicated that, first, the embryonic ectoderm development (EED) gene is a candidate gene associated with the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and, second, that the haplotypes of the EED polymorphism are one of the markers for UC susceptibility. The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) increases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.   The present study aimed at determining the association between polymorphisms in the EED gene and CRC.   Genotype analysis of EED single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed with high-resolution melting analysis, and the genotype and allele frequencies of the EED SNPs were compared between CRC patients and healthy controls. The haplotype frequencies of EED for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.   Our study had a power of 76.6% at a 0.05 significance level. Genotype and allele frequencies of the SNPs and haplotype frequencies of the EED gene in CRC patients were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. Only the allele frequency of g.-1850G>C in the rectal cancer (RC) patient group was significantly different from that of the control group (p=0.04). Similarly, the genotype and allelic frequencies of the EED SNPs for either tumor site (left or right) or tumor stage were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. However, our data show an association between the g.-993G>C polymorphism in the EED gene and the presence of lymph node metastasis in CRC.  These results suggest that the SNPs of the EED gene might not be associated with susceptibility to CRC. However, this study shows that the allele frequency of g.-1850G>C in the RC patient group was significantly different from that in the control group (p=0.04) and that g.-993G>C may play a role in the lymph node metastatic process of CRC.\n",
      "Published observational studies have revealed the connection between neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whereas the causal association remains largely unclear. Our study aims to assess the causality and identify the shared genetic architecture between neurodegenerative disorders and IBD. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to assess the causality between IBD and neurodegenerative disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], and multiple sclerosis [MS]). Shared genetic loci, functional interpretation, and transcriptomic profiles were further investigated in ALS and IBD. We identified that genetic predisposition to IBD was suggestively associated with lower odds of ALS (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 0.99). In contrast, IBD was not genetically associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, or MS (and vice versa). Two shared genetic loci (rs6571361 and rs7154847) were derived, and SCFD1, G2E3, and HEATR5A were further identified as novel risk genes with enriched functions related to membrane trafficking. G2E3 was differentially expressed and significantly correlated with SCFD1 in patients with ALS or IBD. Our study reveals the suggestively protective role of IBD on ALS, and does not support the causality of AD, PD, or MS on IBD (and vice versa). Our findings indicate possible shared genetic architecture and pathways between ALS and IBD. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of IBD and neurodegenerative disorders.\n",
      "Spectraplakins are a family of evolutionarily conserved gigantic proteins and play critical roles in many cytoskeleton-related processes. Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) is one of the most versatile spectraplakin with multiple isoforms. As a broadly expressed mammalian spectraplakin, MACF1 is important in maintaining normal functions of many tissues. The loss-of-function studies using knockout mouse models reveal the pivotal roles of MACF1 in embryo development, skin integrity maintenance, neural development, bone formation, and colonic paracellular permeability. Mutation in the human MACF1 gene causes a novel myopathy genetic disease. In addition, abnormal expression of MACF1 is associated with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, cancer and osteoporosis. This demonstrates the crucial roles of MACF1 in physiology and pathology. Here, we review the research advances of MACF1's roles in specific tissue and in human diseases, providing the perspectives of MACF1 for future studies.\n",
      "Microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1) mutations are known to play an important role in the progression of various cancers. However, its role in breast cancer remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated how MACF1 mutations may play a role in breast cancer development. The gene-expression profile data of patients with breast cancer were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Breast cancer cohort. We estimated the influence of MACF1 mutations on patient clinical prognosis using the Kaplan-Meier method. Further, patients with MACF1-mutant (MACF1-MT) and MACF1-wild-type (MACF1-WT) were compared to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also performed functional enrichment analyses, constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, and investigated the correlation between MACF1 mutations and immune-cell infiltration. To explore the prognostic value of MACF1 mutations, a nomogram was developed based on MACF1 mutations and other clinicopathological parameters. Patients with MACF1-MT had a worse prognosis and higher tumor mutation burden score (P < 0.05) than patients with MACF1-WT. MACF1 mutations were demonstrated to upregulate the mTOR signaling pathway and alter energy metabolism and tumor immune microenvironment. Thus, MACF1 mutations might affect immunogenicity and result in a lower response to immunotherapy. By analyzing the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to 13 drugs was found to be significantly enhanced by MACF1 mutations. The prognostic model was verified in predicting the outcome of breast cancer patients. MACF1 mutations might be a potential prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for breast cancer.\n",
      "Proteins are tiny players involved in the activation and deactivation of multiple signaling cascades through interactions in cells. The TNFR1 and MADD interact with each other and mediate downstream protein signaling pathways which cause neuronal cell death and Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, a molecular docking approach was employed to explore the interactive behavior of TNFR1 and MADD proteins and their role in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The computational sequential and structural conformational results revealed that Asp400, Arg58, Arg59 were common residues of TNFR1 and MADD which are involved in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Aspartic acid in negatively charged residues is involved in the biosynthesis of protein. However, arginine is a positively charged residue with the potential to interact with oppositely charged amino acids. Furthermore, our molecular dynamic simulation results also ensured the stability of the backbone of TNFR1 and MADD death domains (DDs) in binding interactions. This DDs interaction mediates some conformational changes in TNFR1 which leads to the activation of mediators proteins in the cellular signaling pathways. Taken together, a better understanding of TNFR1 and MADD receptors and their activated signaling cascade may help treat Alzheimer's disease. The death domains of TNFR1 and MADD could be used as a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.\n",
      "Midkine (MDK) is a multifunctional secreted protein that can act as a cytokine or growth factor regulating multiple signaling pathways and being implicated in fundamental cellular processes, such as survival, proliferation, and migration. Although its expression in normal adult tissues is barely detectable, MDK serum levels are found to be elevated in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this review, we summarize the findings of recent studies on the role of MDK in HCC diagnosis and progression. Overall, studies show that MDK is a powerful biomarker for HCC early diagnosis, as it can differentiate not only between HCC patients and normal individuals but also between HCC patients and patients with other liver pathologies. It is correlated with high recurrence rates and was shown to be valuable for the diagnosis of early-stage HCC, even in patients negative for α-fetoprotein (AFP), the most commonly used biomarker for HCC diagnosis. A comparison with AFP reveals that MDK is inferior to AFP with regard to specificity but significantly superior with regard to sensitivity, which further indicates the need for using both biomarkers for more effective HCC diagnosis.\n",

      "Membrane frizzled-related protein (MFRP) plays a critical role in ocular development. <i>MFRP</i> mutations are known to cause nanophthalmos and, in some cases, retinitis pigmentosa, foveoschisis, and/or optic nerve head (ONH) drusen. The broad clinical spectrum of <i>MFRP</i> mutations necessitates further investigation of specific genotype-phenotype relationships. We reviewed ophthalmologic and genetic medical records of two affected siblings and one unaffected sibling. Genetic testing revealed variants <i>MFRP</i> c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and <i>MFRP</i> c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro) in <i>trans</i> in the two affected siblings. In both cases, photopic and scotopic responses were markedly reduced on electroretinogram (ERG), with greater decrease in scotopic function. Optical coherence tomography for both siblings revealed non-cystoid thickening. Blunted foveal reflexes were also observed in both siblings. Notably, foveal avascular zone abnormalities were seen on fundus autofluorescence in only one affected sibling. MFRP-related ocular disease may be underrecognized due to its presentation with high hyperopia and possibly subtle retinal findings. Presence of variants <i>MFRP</i> c.855T>A, p.(Cys285*) and <i>MFRP</i> c.1235T>C, p.(Leu412Pro) in <i>trans</i> resulted in nanophthalmos and retinitis pigmentosa without associated foveoschisis or ONH drusen in our patients, consistent with the incomplete phenotype previously described in Neri et al. Abnormalities in the foveal avascular zone have been noted in other case studies and were inconsistently associated with the variants described here, representing a potential area for future investigation.\n",
      "The 5' amino-labeled DNA probe complementary to mga gene of Streptococcus pyogenes was immobilized on carboxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes electrode and hybridized with 0.1-100 ng/6 μl single-stranded genomic DNA (ssG-DNA) of S. pyogenes from throat swab of suspected rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients. Electrochemical response was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance (EI). The sensitivity of the sensor was 106.03 (μA/cm(2))/ng and limit of detection (LOD) was found 0.014 ng/6 μl with regression coefficient (R(2)) of 0.921 using DPV. The genosensor was characterized by FTIR and SEM, and electrode was found stable for 6 months on storage at 4 °C with 5-6 % loss in initial DPV current. mga genosensor is the first report on RHD sensor which can save life of several suspected patients by early diagnosis in 30 min.\n",
      "Schindler disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGA) activity due to defects in the NAGA gene. Accumulation of the enzyme's substrates results in clinically heterogeneous symptoms ranging from asymptomatic individuals to individuals with severe neurological manifestations. Here, a 5-year-old Emirati male born to consanguineous parents presented with congenital microcephaly and severe neurological manifestations. Whole genome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense variant (c.838C>A; p.L280I) in the NAGA gene. The allele is a reported SNP in the ExAC database with a 0.0007497 allele frequency. The proband's asymptomatic sister and cousin carry the same genotype in a homozygous state as revealed from the family screening. Due to the extreme intrafamilial heterogeneity of the disease as seen in previously reported cases, we performed further analyses to establish the pathogenicity of this variant. Both the proband and his sister showed abnormal urine oligosaccharide patterns, which is consistent with the diagnosis of Schindler disease. The α-NAGA activity was significantly reduced in the proband and his sister with 5.9% and 12.1% of the mean normal activity, respectively. Despite the activity loss, p.L280I α-NAGA processing and trafficking were not affected. However, protein molecular dynamic simulation analysis revealed that this amino acid substitution is likely to affect the enzyme's natural dynamics and hinders its ability to bind to the active site. Functional analysis confirmed the pathogenicity of the identified missense variant and the diagnosis of Schindler disease. Extreme intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity of the disease necessitates further studies for proper genetic counseling and management.\n",
      "<b>Background:</b> Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of studies indicating an essential role of the lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) at the genetic, biochemical, and cellular pathway levels. In this study, we investigated the association between rare variants in lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) genes and Chinese mainland PD. <b>Methods:</b> We explored the association between rare variants of 69 LSD genes and PD in 3,879 patients and 2,931 controls from Parkinson's Disease & Movement Disorders Multicenter Database and Collaborative Network in China (PD-MDCNC) using next-generation sequencing, which were analyzed by using the optimized sequence kernel association test. <b>Results:</b> We identified the significant burden of rare putative LSD gene variants in Chinese mainland patients with PD. This association was robust in familial or sporadic early-onset patients after excluding the <i>GBA</i> variants but not in sporadic late-onset patients. The burden analysis of variant sets in genes of LSD subgroups revealed a suggestive significant association between variant sets in genes of sphingolipidosis deficiency disorders and familial or sporadic early-onset patients. In contrast, variant sets in genes of sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, and post-translational modification defect disorders were suggestively associated with sporadic late-onset patients. Then, <i>SMPD1</i> and other four novel genes (i.e., <i>GUSB, CLN6, PPT1</i>, and <i>SCARB2</i>) were suggestively associated with sporadic early-onset or familial patients, whereas <i>GALNS</i> and <i>NAGA</i> were suggestively associated with late-onset patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings supported the association between LSD genes and PD and revealed several novel risk genes in Chinese mainland patients with PD, which confirmed the importance of lysosomal mechanisms in PD pathogenesis. Moreover, we identified the genetic heterogeneity in early-onset and late-onset of patients with PD, which may provide valuable suggestions for the treatment.\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed that genetic variants at the 22q13.2 risk locus were robustly associated with schizophrenia. However, the causal variants at this risk locus and their roles in schizophrenia remain elusive. Here we identify the risk missense variant rs1801311 (located in the 1st exon of NDUFA6 gene) as likely causal for schizophrenia at 22q13.2 by disrupting binding of YY1, TAF1, and POLR2A. We systematically elucidated the regulatory mechanisms of rs1801311 and validated the regulatory effect of this missense variant. Intriguingly, rs1801311 physically interacted with NAGA (encodes the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which is mainly involved in regulating metabolisms of glycoproteins and glycolipids in lysosome) and showed the most significant association with NAGA expression in the human brain, with the risk allele (G) associated with higher NAGA expression. Consistent with eQTL analysis, expression analysis showed that NAGA was significantly upregulated in brains of schizophrenia cases compared with controls, further supporting that rs1801311 may confer schizophrenia risk by regulating NAGA expression. Of note, we found that NAGA regulates important neurodevelopmental processes, including proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Transcriptome analysis corroborated that NAGA regulates pathways associated with neuronal differentiation. Finally, we independently confirmed the association between rs1801311 and schizophrenia in a large Chinese cohort. Our study elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the missense schizophrenia risk variant rs1801311 and provides mechanistic links between risk variant and schizophrenia etiology. In addition, this study also revealed the novel role of coding variants in gene regulation and schizophrenia risk, i.e., genetic variant in coding region of a specific gene may confer disease risk through regulating distal genes (act as regulatory variant for distal genes).\n",
      "Kawasaki disease (KD; MIM#61175) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome with unknown etiology which predominantly affects infants and children. Recent findings of susceptibility genes for KD suggest possible involvement of the Ca(2+)/NFAT pathway in the pathogenesis of KD. ORAI1 is a Ca(2+) release activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel mediating store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) on the plasma membrane. The gene for ORAI1 is located in chromosome 12q24 where a positive linkage signal was observed in our previous affected sib-pair study of KD. A common non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism located within exon 2 of ORAI1 (rs3741596) was significantly associated with KD (P = 0.028 in the discovery sample set (729 KD cases and 1,315 controls), P = 0.0056 in the replication sample set (1,813 KD cases vs. 1,097 controls) and P = 0.00041 in a meta-analysis by the Mantel-Haenszel method). Interestingly, frequency of the risk allele of rs3741596 is more than 20 times higher in Japanese compared to Europeans. We also found a rare 6 base-pair in-frame insertion variant associated with KD (rs141919534; 2,544 KD cases vs. 2,414 controls, P = 0.012). These data indicate that ORAI1 gene variations are associated with KD and may suggest the potential importance of the Ca(2+)/NFAT pathway in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\n",
      "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive liver fat deposition, and progresses to liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the invasive diagnosis of NAFLD with histopathological evaluation remains risky. This study investigated potential genes correlated with NAFLD, which may serve as diagnostic biomarkers and even potential treatment targets. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed based on dataset E-MEXP-3291. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to evaluate the function of genes. Blue module was positively correlated, and turquoise module negatively correlated with the severity of NAFLD. Furthermore, 8 driving genes (ANXA9, FBXO2, ORAI3, NAGS, C/EBPα, CRYAA, GOLM1, TRIM14) were identified from the overlap of genes in blue module and GSE89632. And another 8 driving genes were identified from the overlap of turquoise module and GSE89632. Among these driving genes, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α) was the most notable. By validating the expression of C/EBPα in the liver of NAFLD mice using immunohistochemistry, we discovered a significant upregulation of C/EBPα protein in NAFLD. we identified two modules and 16 driving genes associated with the progression of NAFLD, and confirmed the protein expression of C/EBPα, which had been paid little attention to in the context of NAFLD, in the present study. Our study will advance the understanding of NAFLD. Moreover, these driving genes may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of NAFLD.\n",
      "In search of tumor suppressor genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), we previously used gene expression profiling to identify genes underexpressed in tumor compared with paired unaffected tissue. While searching for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in genomic regions harboring candidate tumor suppressor genes, we detected LOH in a approximately 20 kb region around marker D9S176. Several ESTs flanking D9S176 were underexpressed in PTC tumors, and for one of the ESTs, downregulation was highly associated with the activating BRAF mutation V600E, the most common genetic lesion in PTC. A novel gene, NAMA, (noncoding RNA associated with MAP kinase pathway and growth arrest) containing the affected EST was cloned and characterized. NAMA is weakly expressed in several human tissues, and the spliced forms are primarily detected in testis. Several characteristics of NAMA suggest that it is a nonprotein coding but functional RNA; it has no long open reading frames (ORFs); the exons exhibit low sequence identity in the evolutionarily conserved regions; it is inducible by knockdown of BRAF, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, growth arrest and DNA damage in cancer cell lines. We suggest that NAMA is a noncoding RNA associated with growth arrest.\n",
      "To capture the full spectrum of genetic risk for autism, we performed a two-stage analysis of rare de novo and inherited coding variants in 42,607 autism cases, including 35,130 new cases recruited online by SPARK. We identified 60 genes with exome-wide significance (P < 2.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), including five new risk genes (NAV3, ITSN1, MARK2, SCAF1 and HNRNPUL2). The association of NAV3 with autism risk is primarily driven by rare inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants, with an estimated relative risk of 4, consistent with moderate effect. Autistic individuals with LoF variants in the four moderate-risk genes (NAV3, ITSN1, SCAF1 and HNRNPUL2; n = 95) have less cognitive impairment than 129 autistic individuals with LoF variants in highly penetrant genes (CHD8, SCN2A, ADNP, FOXP1 and SHANK3) (59% vs 88%, P = 1.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Power calculations suggest that much larger numbers of autism cases are needed to identify additional moderate-risk genes.\n",
      "The recently described navigator proteins have a multifaceted role in cytoskeletal dynamics. We report here on the relevance of one of them, navigator 3 (NAV3), in colorectal cancer (CRC). We analysed changes in chromosome 12 and NAV3 copy number in CRC/adenoma samples of 59 patients and in 6 CRC cell lines, using fluorescence in situ hybridisation, loss of heterozygosity, and array-CGH. NAV3 target genes were identified by siRNA depletion, expression arrays, and immunohistochemistry. NAV3 deletion and chromosome 12 polysomy were detected in 30 and 70% of microsatellite stability (MSS) carcinomas, in 23 and 30% of adenomas and in four of six CRC cell lines. NAV3 amplification was found in 25% of MSS samples. NAV3 alterations correlated with lymph node metastasis. In normal colon cells, NAV3 silencing induced upregulation of interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) and gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor. In MSS and microsatellite instability tumours, IL23R immunoreactivity correlated with Dukes' staging and lymph node metastases, whereas nuclear beta-catenin correlated with lymph node metastases only. NAV3 copy number changes are frequent in CRC and in adenomas, and upregulation of IL23R, following NAV3 silencing, strongly correlates with Dukes' staging and lymph node metastases. This suggests that NAV3 has a role in linking tissue inflammation to cancer development in the colon.\n",
      "We previously reported that children exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) that carried variants in the NAT1 gene had over two-fold higher hair cotinine levels. Our objective was to determine if NAT1 polymorphisms confer increased risk for developing asthma in children exposed to SHS. White participants in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (<i>n</i> = 359) were genotyped for 10 <i>NAT1</i> variants. Smoke exposure was defined by hair cotinine and parental report. Asthma was objectively assessed by spirometry and methacholine challenge. Findings were replicated in the Genomic Control Cohort (<i>n</i> = 638). Significant associations between 5 <i>NAT1</i> variants and asthma were observed in the CCAAPS exposed group compared to none in the unexposed group. There was a significant interaction between <i>NAT1</i> rs13253389 and rs4921581 with smoke exposure (<i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and hair cotinine level (<i>p</i> = 0.048, <i>p</i> = 0.042). Children wildtype for rs4921581 had increasing asthma risk with increasing hair cotinine level, whereas those carrying the <i>NAT1</i> minor allele had an increased risk of asthma regardless of cotinine level. In the GCC, 13 <i>NAT1</i> variants were associated with asthma in the smoke-exposed group, compared to 0 in the unexposed group, demonstrating gene-level replication. Variation in the <i>NAT1</i> gene modifies asthma risk in children exposed to secondhand-smoke. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gene-environment interaction between <i>NAT1</i> variants, smoke exposure, cotinine levels, and pediatric asthma. <i>NAT1</i> genotype may have clinical utility as a biomarker of increased asthma risk in children exposed to smoke.\n",
      "Exposure to carcinogens present in the diet, cigarette smoke, or the environment may be associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Aromatic amines (aryl- and heterocyclic) are a class of carcinogens that are important in these exposures. These compounds can be N- or O-acetylated by the NAT1 or NAT2 enzymes, resulting in activation or in some cases detoxification. Recent studies have shown that both NAT2 and NAT1 genes exhibit variation in human populations and that rapid acetylation by the NAT2 enzyme may be a risk factor for colorectal cancer. In this study we have analyzed for genetic polymorphism in both NAT1 and NAT2 in a group of 202 colorectal cancer patients and 112 control subjects from Staffordshire, England. We find significantly increased risk (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2; P = 0.009) associated with the NAT1*10 allele of NAT1, an allele that contains a variant polyadenylation signal. Individuals with higher stage tumors (Duke's C) were more likely to inherit this variant allele (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.7; P = 0.005). In contrast, rapid acetylation genotypes of NAT2 were not a significant risk factor in this English population. However, we found that the risk associated with the NAT1 variant allele (NAT1*10) was most apparent among NAT2 rapid acetylators (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.7; P = 0.003), suggesting a possible gene-gene interaction between NAT1 and NAT2 (test for interaction; P = 0.12). This is the first study to test for cancer risk associated with the NAT1 gene, and these positive findings suggest that NAT1 alleles may be important genetic determinents of colorectal cancer risk.\n",
      "In a population-based case-control study in California of 228 infants, we investigated 75 genetic variants in 20 genes and risk of gastroschisis with regard to maternal age, race/ethnicity, vitamin use, and smoking exposure. We hypothesized that genes related to vascular compromise may interact with environmental factors to affect the risk of gastroschisis. Haplotypes were constructed for 75 gene variants using the HaploView program. Risk for gastroschisis associated with each gene variant was calculated for both the homozygotes and the heterozygotes, with the homozygous wildtypes as the referent. Risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by logistic regression. We found 11 gene variants with increased risk and four variants with decreased risk of gastroschisis for heterozygous (OR<sub>h</sub> ) or homozygous variants (OR<sub>v</sub> ) genotypes. These included NOS3 (rs1036145) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.7); NOS3 (rs10277237) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3-6.0); ADD1 (rs12503220) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6-5.4), GNB3 (rs5443) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.5), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9); ICAM1 (rs281428) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 6.9 (95% CI: 2.1-22.9), ICAM1 (rs3093030) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.2-5.6); ICAM4 (rs281438) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 4.9 (95% CI: 1.4-16.6), ICAM5 (rs281417) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.1), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 4.8 (95% CI: 1.7-13.6); ICAM5 (rs281440) OR<sub>h</sub>  = 23.7 (95% CI: 5.5-102.5), OR<sub>v</sub>  = 20.6 (95% CI: 3.4-124.3); ICAM5 (rs2075741) OR<sub>v</sub>  = 2.2 (95% CI: 1.1-4.4); NAT1 OR<sub>v</sub>  = 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-0.9). There were additional associations between several gene variants and gastroschisis among women aged 20-24 and among mothers with and without vitamin use. NOS3, ADD1, ICAM1, ICAM4, and ICAM5 warrant further investigation in additional populations and with the interaction of additional environmental exposures. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Keratolenticular dysgenesis (KLD) and ectopia lentis are congenital eye defects. The aim of this study is the identification of molecular genetic alterations responsible for those ocular anomalies with neurologic impairment in an individual with a de novo balanced chromosome translocation t(11;18)(q23.3;q11.2)dn. Disruption of OAF, the human orthologue of the Drosophila oaf, by the 11q23.3 breakpoint results in reduced expression of this transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, four most likely nonfunctional chimeric transcripts comprising up to OAF exon 3, derived from the der(11) allele, have also been identified. This locus has been implicated by publicly available genome-wide association data in corneal disease and corneal topography. The expression of the poliovirus receptor-related 1(PVRL1) or nectin cell adhesion molecule 1 (NECTIN1), a paralogue of nectin cell adhesion molecule 3 (PVRL3) associated with congenital ocular defects, situated 500 kb upstream from 11q23.3 breakpoint, is increased. The 18q11.2 breakpoint is localized between cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen 1(CTAGE1) and retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8) genes. Genomic imbalance that could contribute to the observed phenotype was excluded. Analysis of gene expression datasets throughout normal murine ocular lens embryogenesis suggests that OAF expression is significantly enriched in the lens from early stages of development through adulthood, whereas PVRL1 is lens-enriched until E12.5 and then down-regulated. This contrasts with the observation that the proposita's lymphoblastoid cell lines exhibit low OAF and high PVRL1 expression as compared to control, which offers further support that the alterations described above are most likely responsible for the clinical phenotype. Finally, gene interaction topology data for PVRL1 also agree with our proposal that disruption of OAF by the translocation breakpoint and misregulation of PVRL1 due to a position effect contribute to the observed ocular and neurological phenotype.\n",
      "The underlying mechanism of coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (anti-HBs) is still controversial. To identify the host genetic factors related to this unusual clinical phenomenon, a two-stage study was conducted in the Chinese Han population. In the first stage, we performed a case-control (1:1) age- and gender-matched study of 101 cases with concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs and 102 controls with negative HBsAg and positive anti-HBs using whole exome sequencing. In the second validation stage, we directly sequence the 16 exons on the OAS3 gene in two dependent cohorts of 48 cases and 200 controls. Although, in the first stage, a genome-wide association study of 58,563 polymorphism variants in 101 cases and 102 controls found no significant loci (P-value ≤ .05/58563), and neither locus achieved a conservative genome-wide significance threshold (P-value ≤ 5e-08), gene-based burden analysis showed that OAS3 gene rare variants were associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs. (P-value = 4.127e-06 ≤ 0.05/6994). A total of 16 rare variants were screened out from 21 cases and 3 controls. In the second validation stage, one case with a stop-gained rare variant was identified. Fisher's exact test of all 149 cases and 302 controls showed that the rare coding sequence mutations were more frequent in cases vs controls (P-value = 7.299e-09, OR = 17.27, 95% CI [5.01-58.72]). Protein-coding rare variations on the OAS3 gene are associated with the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in patients with chronic HBV infection in Chinese Han population.\n",
      "Neurological complications of AIDS (NeuroAIDS) include primary HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). OAS3 is an enzyme belonging to the 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthase family induced by type I interferons and involved in the degradation of both viral and endogenous RNA. Here, we used microarray datasets from NCBI of brain samples of non-demented HIV-negative controls (NDC), HIV, deceased patients with HAND and encephalitis (HIVE) (treated and untreated with antiretroviral therapy, ART), and with HAND without HIVE. The HAND/HIVE patients were stratified according to the OAS3 gene expression. The genes positively and negatively correlated to the OAS3 gene expression were used to perform a genomic deconvolution analysis using neuroimmune signatures (NIS) belonging to sixteen signatures. Expression analysis revealed significantly higher OAS3 expression in HAND/HIVE and HAND/HIVE/ART compared with NDC. OAS3 expressed an excellent diagnostic ability to discriminate NDC from HAND/HIVE, HAND from HAND/HIVE, HAND from HAND/HIVE/ART, and HIV from HAND/HIVE. Noteworthy, OAS3 expression levels in the brains of HAND/HIVE patients were positively correlated with viral load in both peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, deconvolution analysis revealed that the genes positively correlated to OAS3 expression were associated with inflammatory signatures. Neuronal activation profiles were significantly activated by the genes negatively correlated to OAS3 expression levels. Moreover, gene ontology analysis performed on genes characterizing the microglia signature highlighted an immune response as a main biological process. According to our results, genes positively correlated to OAS3 gene expression in the brains of HAND/HIVE patients are associated with inflammatory transcriptomic signatures and likely worse cognitive impairment.\n",
      "Severe COVID-19 has a poor prognosis, while the genetic mechanism underlying severe COVID-19 remains largely unknown. We aimed to identify genes that are potentially causally associated with severe COVID-19. We conducted a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from 49 different tissues as the exposure and three COVID-19-phenotypes (very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 [severe COVID-19], hospitalized COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infection) as the outcomes. SMR using multiple SNPs was used as a sensitivity analysis to reduce false positive rate. Multiple testing was corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) q-value. We identified 309 significant gene-trait associations (FDR q value < 0.05) across 46 tissues for severe COVID-19, which mapped to 64 genes, of which 38 are novel. The top five most associated protein-coding genes were Interferon Alpha and Beta Receptor Subunit 2 (IFNAR2), 2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 3 (OAS3), mucin 1 (MUC1), Interleukin 10 Receptor Subunit Beta (IL10RB), and Napsin A Aspartic Peptidase (NAPSA). The potential causal genes were enriched in biological processes related to type I interferons, interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 production, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 production. In addition, we further identified 23 genes and 5 biological processes which are unique to hospitalized COVID-19, as well as 13 genes that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified several genes that are potentially causally associated with severe COVID-19. These findings improve our limited understanding of the mechanism of COVID-19 and shed light on the development of therapeutic agents for treating severe COVID-19.\n",
      "Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and varying forms of non-congenital alopecia. The condition is caused by 3'-end mutations of the ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene, which produce carboxy (C)-terminally truncated variants of ODC, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme. C-terminal truncation of ODC prevents its ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and leads to cellular accumulation of ODC enzyme that remains catalytically active. ODC is the first rate-limiting enzyme that converts ornithine to putrescine in the polyamine pathway. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are aliphatic molecules found in all forms of life and are important during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. BABS is an ultra-rare condition with few reported cases, but it serves as a convincing example for drug repurposing therapy. α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, also known as eflornithine) is an ODC inhibitor with a strong safety profile in pediatric use for neuroblastoma and other cancers as well as West African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Patients with BABS have been treated with DFMO and have shown improvement in hair growth, muscle tone, and development.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the foremost neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and significant progressive memory loss. In AD, astrocytes are proposed to take up and clear Aβ plaques. However, how Aβ induces pathogenesis and memory impairment in AD remains elusive. We report that normal astrocytes show non-cyclic urea metabolism, whereas Aβ-treated astrocytes show switched-on urea cycle with upregulated enzymes and accumulated entering-metabolite aspartate, starting-substrate ammonia, end-product urea, and side-product putrescine. Gene silencing of astrocytic ornithine decarboxylase-1 (ODC1), facilitating ornithine-to-putrescine conversion, boosts urea cycle and eliminates aberrant putrescine and its toxic byproducts ammonia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its end product GABA to recover from reactive astrogliosis and memory impairment in AD. Our findings implicate that astrocytic urea cycle exerts opposing roles of beneficial Aβ detoxification and detrimental memory impairment in AD. We propose ODC1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD to facilitate removal of toxic molecules and prevent memory loss.\n",
      "The ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene plays an important role in physiological and cell developmental processes including embryogenesis, organogenesis, and neoplastic cell growth. Here, we report an 32-month-old Caucasian female with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene that leads to a premature abrogation of 14-aa residues at the ODC protein c-terminus. This is the first human case confirming similar symptoms observed in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model first described over 20 years ago. Phenotypic manifestations include macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, spasticity, hypotonia, cutaneous vascular malformation, delayed visual maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. We here describe for the first time a new pediatric disorder that is directly linked to a de novo pathogenic variant in the ODC1 gene. The ODC1 gene mutation (c.1342 A>T) was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Red blood cells obtained from our patient showed elevated ODC protein and polyamine levels compared to healthy controls. Our autosomal dominant patient who carries this gain-of-function ODC1 mutation may benefit from treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine, a well-tolerated, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA-approved drug.\n",
      "The P21-activated kinase PAK3 is critical for cognitive development and truncating mutations cause non-syndromic mental retardation (MR). Missense mutations are also associated with psychotic disorders, most commonly with schizophrenia involving premorbid MR, namely \"pfropfschizophrenie\". We set out to measure the frequency of sequence variants in PAK3 in schizophrenia without premorbid MR. We conducted complete gene reseqeuncing of all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries in patients with schizophrenia with cognitive impairment but without premorbid MR. Deleterious variants in schizophrenia alone were rare (<1/159 or 0.6%). Thereby, while PAK3 remains a strong biological candidate in psychosis, evidence from human genetics provides strongest support for a link to pfropfschizophrenie and not to schizophrenia without premorbid intellectual disability.\n",
      "<b>Background:</b> Common cardiac abnormalities in Noonan syndrome (NS) include congenital heart diseases (CHD), pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Molecular diagnoses are enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis of patients who have a subtle or atypical presentation. The aims of this study were to investigate genotype-phenotype associations with respect to Noonan syndrome (NS)-associated cardiac abnormalities and catheter or surgery-based interventions conditions. <b>Methods:</b> From January 2019 to December 2021, 22 children with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of NS combined with cardiovascular abnormalities were consecutively enrolled into the current study. A comprehensive review was carried out of echocardiography and electrocardiogram results, second-generation whole-exome sequencing results and catheter or surgery-based interventions conditions. <b>Results:</b> The main manifestations of electrocardiogram abnormalities were QTc prolongation, abnormal Q wave in the precordial lead and limb lead, right ventricular hypertrophy and left or right deviation of the electrical axis. The most commonly detected abnormality was pulmonary valve dysplasia with stenosis, seen in 15 (68.2%) patients, followed by atrial septal defect in 11 (50%) patients. Seven genes (<i>RAF1</i>, <i>RIT1</i>, <i>SOS1</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>SOS2</i>, and <i>LZTR1</i>) were found to contain disease-associated variants<i>.</i> The most commonly observed genetic mutations were <i>PTPN11</i> (27%) and <i>RAF1</i> (27%)<i>.</i> Each genotype was associated with specific phenotypic findings. <i>RIT1</i>, <i>SOS1</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, and <i>SOS2</i> had common echocardiography features characterized by pulmonary valve stenosis, while <i>RAF1</i> was characterized by HCM. Interestingly, patients with <i>BRAF</i> mutations were not only characterized by HCM, but also by pulmonary valve stenosis. In the cohort there was only one patient carrying a <i>LZTR1</i> mutation characterized by left ventricle globose dilation. Ten cases underwent catheter or surgery-based interventions. All the operations had immediate results and high success rates. However, some of the cases had adverse outcomes during extended follow-up. Based on the genotype-phenotype associations observed during follow-up, <i>BRAF</i> and <i>RAF1</i> genotypes seem to be poor prognostic factors, and multiple interventions may be required for NS patients with severe pulmonary stenosis or myectomy for HCM. <b>Conclusions:</b> The identification of causal genes in NS patients has enabled the evaluation of genotype-cardiac phenotype relationships and prognosis of the disease. This may be beneficial for the development of therapeutic approaches.\n",
      "In recent years, several genes were found to be involved in the process of epididymo-testicular descent, the most frequently cited ones include INSL3, HOXA10, GNRHR, and KAL1. In this study, we analyzed the differences in gene expression profiles between cryptorchid and descended testes. In particular, we analyzed expression of all recently published genes known to be associated with undescended testis. Twenty-two testicular biopsies from 18 boys were analyzed. We analyzed gene expression in 16 cryptorchid and 6 descended testes using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, and validated the results with qPCR. 3,688 transcripts were differentially expressed with an adjusted p value of <0.05 and a change of at least 1.5-fold. The list contained 1,866 downregulated and 1,822 upregulated transcripts in the cryptorchid testes. A novel observation in our study was that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) and its mediators SOS1 and RAF1 were expressed less in undescended testes. Based on our results, it is possible that a subtle dysfunction (expression) of the FGFR1, SOS1 and RAF1 genes is involved in the development of the most common male reproductive tract disorder - unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.\n",
      "RNA terminal phosphate cyclase like 1 (<i>RCL1</i>) undergoes overexpression during the immune response of <i>Candida albicans</i> following drug treatment. This study aims to investigate the expression levels of <i>RCL1</i> in <i>C. albicans</i> under various stress conditions. Fifteen itraconazole (ITR)-resistant strains of clinical <i>C. albicans</i>, and one standard strain were employed for <i>RCL1</i> sequencing, and mutations in <i>RCL1</i> were analyzed. Subsequently, 14 out of the 15 ITR-resistant clinical strains and 14 clinical strains sensitive to ITR, fluconazole (FCA) as well as voriconazole (VRC) were cultured under diverse conditions. The expression of <i>RCL1</i> ITR-resistant and sensitive <i>C. albicans</i> was then assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays. Compared to the standard strain, three missense mutations (C6A, G10A, and A11T) were identified in the <i>RCL1</i> gene of ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans</i> through successful forward sequencing. Additionally, using successful reverse sequencing, one synonymous mutation (C1T) and four missense mutations (C1T, A3T, A7G, and T8G) were found in the <i>RCL1</i> gene of ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans. RCL1</i> expression was significantly higher in ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans</i> than in sensitive strains under standard conditions (37°C, 0.03% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 4.0). Low temperature (25°C) increased <i>RCL1</i> expression in sensitive <i>C. albicans</i> while decreasing it in ITR-resistant strains. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) had a negligible effect on <i>RCL1</i> expression in sensitive <i>C. albicans</i>, but effectively reduced <i>RCL1</i> level in ITR-resistant strains. Furthermore, a medium with a pH of 7 decreased the expression of <i>RCL1</i> in both resistant and sensitive <i>C. albicans</i>. This study demonstrated that <i>RCL1</i> mutations in ITR-resistant <i>C. albicans</i>, and variations in culture conditions significantly influence <i>RCL1</i> expression in both ITR-resistant and sensitive <i>C. albicans</i>, thereby inducing alterations in the dimorphism of <i>C. albicans</i>.\n",
      "Regulator of G-protein signalling (RGS) proteins inhibit signalling by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs mediate the functions of several important neurotransmitters and serve as targets of many anti-psychotics. RGS2, RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16 are located on chromosome 1q23.3-31, a locus found to be associated with schizophrenia. Although previous gene expression analysis detected down-regulation of RGS4 expression in brain samples of patients with schizophrenia, the results were not consistent. In the present study, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of differential RGS2, RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16 expression in Brodmann Area 10 (BA10) samples of patients with schizophrenia and from healthy controls. Two microarray datasets met the inclusion criteria (overall, 41 schizophrenia samples and 38 controls were analysed). RGS2 and RGS16 were found to be up-regulated in BA10 samples of individuals with schizophrenia, whereas no differential expression of RGS4 and RGS5 was detected. Analysis of dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex samples of the CommonMind Consortium (258 schizophrenia samples vs. 279 controls) further validated the results. Given their central role in inactivating G-protein-coupled signalling pathways, our results suggest that differential gene expression might lead to enhanced inactivation of G-protein signalling in schizophrenia. This, in turn, suggests that additional studies are needed to further explore the consequences of the differential expression we detected, this time at the protein and functional levels.\n",
      "Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) is a gene induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a major contributor to multiple tumor types. Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive and fatal cancer with poor treatment outcomes after progression. In this study, we evaluated SERP1's role in tumorigenesis, prognosis, and immune infiltration in SKCM. Patients with SKCM had low SERP1 expression. We identified differentially expressed genes between high- and low-SERP1 expression groups and conducted functional, pathway, and gene enrichment analyses. Protein-protein (PPI) and gene-gene interaction (GGI) networks were constructed via STRING and GeneMANIA, respectively. SERP1 mutation information was obtained through cBioPortal; location in the skin was identified through the Human Protein Atlas. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an association between low SERP1 expression and overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progress-free interval (PFI) rates, and worse prognosis in patients with multiple clinicopathological features. Cox regression analysis and nomograms further presented SERP1 level as an independent prognostic factor for patients with SKCM. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between SERP1 expression and immune infiltrates; thus, low SERP1 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and can be considered a poor prognostic biomarker in patients with SKCM.

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings heavy burden to society and family. There is an urgent need to find effective methods for disease diagnosis and treatment. The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach that could aggregate the resulting gene lists has been widely utilized in genomic data analysis. To identify hub genes using RRA approach in AD. Seven microarray datasets in frontal cortex from GEO database were used to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) in AD patients using RRA approach. STRING was performed to explore the protein-to-protein interaction (PPI). Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were utilized for enrichment analysis. Human Gene Connectome and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used for functional annotation. Finally, the expression levels of hub genes were validated in the cortex of 5xFAD mice by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After RRA analysis, 473 DEGs (216 upregulated and 257 downregulated) were identified in AD samples. PPI showed that DEGs had a total of 416 nodes and 2750 edges. These genes were divided into 17 clusters, each of which contains at least three genes. After functional annotation and enrichment analysis, TAC1 is identified as the hub gene and may be related to synaptic function and inflammation. In addition, Tac1 was found downregulated in cortices of 5xFAD mice. In the current study, TAC1 is identified as a key gene in the frontal cortex of AD, providing insight into the possible pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for this disease.\n",
      "Autism (MIM 209850) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disturbances in social interaction and communication, by repetitive body movements and restricted interests, and by atypical language development. Several twin and family studies have shown strong evidence for genetic factors in the etiology of autism. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. Glutamate systems are involved in the pathophysiology of autism. There are many similarities between the symptoms evoked by glutamate antagonist treatment and symptoms of autism found in several human and animal studies. To elucidate the genetic background of autism, we analyzed the relationship between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Tachykinin 1 gene (TAC1) and autism, because TAC1 is located in the candidate region for autism and produces substance P and neurokinins. These products modulate glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission and are also involved in inflammation. Many different inflammation-related mechanisms could be involved in the autistic brain. Therefore, TAC1 may have some functions associated with the presumable pathophysiology of autism. We compared the allele and haplotype frequencies between autistic patients (n=170) and normal controls (n=214) in the Japanese population, but no significant difference was observed. Thus, the TAC1 locus is not likely to play a major role in the development of autism.\n",
      "The potential relevance of chromosome 7q21-22 in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) has been highlighted in genome-wide linkage screens as well as in association studies of 7q-specific polymorphic microsatellites. Especially, recent, independently performed studies have provided evidence for significant association of the markers D7S554 and D7S3126 with MS in Sardinian, Northern Irish and Spanish-American cohorts. The gene most closely located to these markers is the neuropeptide preprotachykinin-1 (TAC1) gene. Both its position and the array of biological functions exerted by its expression products make it a logical primary choice for further scrutiny as the putative chromosome 7q21-22 MS susceptibility gene. We report identification of eight polymorphisms in this gene by means of a sequencing approach. A Northern Irish case-control was typed for six of these polymorphisms. One of these, an intron 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), showed significant association with MS (P=0.009). Two-marker haplotypes composed of allelic combinations of TAC1 promoter-intron 1 SNPs were highly significantly associated with MS and more so with the relapsing-remitting form of this disease. While independent reproduction of these data in other data sets is indicated, our work is suggestive for a role of the TAC1 gene in MS.

      "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is attributed to development of Lewy bodies and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic indicators for PD. In this study, we aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for PD and analyzed the impact of immune cell infiltrations on disease pathogenesis. The PD expression profile data for human SN tissue, GSE7621, GSE20141, GSE20159, GSE20163 and GSE20164 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for use in the training model. After normalization and merging, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Robust rank aggregation (RRA) analysis. Simultaneously, DEGs after batch correction were identified. Gene interactions were determined through venn Diagram analysis. Functional analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to the identify hub genes, which were visualized through Cytoscape. A Lasso Cox regression model was employed to identify the potential diagnostic genes. The GSE20292 dataset was used for validation. The proportion of infiltrating immune cells in the samples were determined via the CIBERSORT method. Sixty-two DEGs were screened in this study. They were found to be enriched in nerve conduction, dopamine (DA) metabolism, and DA biosynthesis Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The PPI network and Lasso Cox regression analysis revealed seven potential diagnostic genes, namely SLC18A2, TAC1, PCDH8, KIAA0319, PDE6H, AXIN1, and AGTR1, were subsequently validated in peripheral blood samples obtained from healthy control (HC) and PD patients, as well as in the GSE20292 dataset. The results revealed the exceptional sensitivity and specificity of these genes in PD diagnosis and monitoring. Moreover, PD patients exhibited a higher number of plasma cells, compared to HC individuals. The SLC18A2, TAC1, PCDH8, KIAA0319, PDE6H, AXIN1, and AGTR1 are potential diagnostic biomarkers for PD. Our findings also reveal the essential roles of immune cell infiltration in both disease onset and trajectory.\n",
      "The related immunomodulatory neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP; gene symbol ADCYAP1) have recently been proposed as novel therapeutics for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). These neuropeptides, as well as those belonging to the tachykinin family exert pleiotropic effects, many of which are of relevance to central nervous system inflammation. In the present study, we have analysed 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 microsatellite markers in the VIP, ADCYAP1, TAC3 and TAC4 genes for susceptibility to MS in a case-control collection from Northern Ireland. Following correction for multiple comparisons, we did not find any significant associations between single polymorphic markers or multiple-marker haplotypes and susceptibility to MS. Furthermore, we analysed 2 SNPs in the TAC1 gene in a set of Sardinian trio MS families, based on our previous observation of association of these SNPs with MS in the Northern Irish (Genes Immun. 2005, 6, 265-270). Analysis of these SNPs in the Sardinians was not significant though a similar trend to that originally observed in the Northern Irish was present. Meta-analysis of the Sardinian and Northern Irish TAC1 SNP genotype data revealed a Mantel-Haenszel Common OR Estimate for the TAC1 intron 1 SNP rs2072100 of 0.76 (95% CI 0.63-0.92; P=0.005; A allele) and for the TAC1 promoter SNP rs7793277 of 0.76 (95% CI 0.615-0.95; P=0.014; C allele). Our data advocate a need for further exploration of the TAC1 gene region in MS.\n",
      "VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a recently described, late-onset, acquired autoinflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the <i>UBA1</i> gene. The various clinical manifestations of VEXAS broadly divided into inflammatory or haematological. VEXAS defines a new disease category - the hematoinflammatory disorders triggered by somatic mutations restricted to blood but causing systemic inflammation with multi-organ involvement and associated with aberrant bone marrow status. VEXAS causes significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, but the optimum standard of care remains undefined. This review describes the discovery of VEXAS, relevant genetic causes and immunopathology of the disease. A detailed account of its various clinical manifestations and disease mimics is provided. Current treatment and management options are discussed. New rare variants in <i>UBA1</i> and VEXAS-like <i>UBA1</i> negative cases are reported. Consensus diagnostic criteria might be required to define VEXAS and its related disorders. Investigation of sporadic, VEXAS-like cases will require the application of deep sequencing using DNA obtained from various cellular or tissue locations. Prospective studies are needed to define the optimal supportive and treatment options for patients with varying disease severity and prognosis. VEXAS-specific hematopoietic stem cell transplant selection criteria also require development.\n",

      "For this study, we investigated comprehensive expression of conjoined genes (CGs) in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) cell line KPUM-UH1 by using paired-end RNA sequencing. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of these transcripts in an additional 21 cell lines, 37 primary samples of various malignancies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four normal individuals. Seventeen CGs were detected in KPUM-UH1: CTBS-GNG5, SRP9-EPHX1, RMND5A-ANAPC, OTX1-EHBP1, ATF2-CHN1, PRKAA1-TTC33, LARP1-MRPL22, LOC105379697-BAK1, TIAM2-SCAF8, SPAG1-VPS13B, WBP1L-CNNM2, NARS2-GAB2, CTSC-RAB38, VAMP1-CD27-AS1, LRRC37A2-NSF, UBA2-WTIP and ZNF600-ZNF611. To our knowledge, 10 of these genes have not been previously reported. The various characteristics of the CGs included in- and out-of-frame fusions, chimeras involving non-coding RNA and transcript variants. A finding of note was that LARP1-MRPL2 was characterized as in-frame fusion and was recurrently expressed in B-NHL samples. In this study, variety of CGs was expressed both in malignant and normal cells, some of which might be specific to lymphoma.\n",
      "The tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 gene (WARS1), encodes a tryptophan-tRNA synthetase involved in the amino acidification of tryptophan-tRNA and has been reported to be involved in cancer cell growth, metastasis promotion, and drug resistance in a variety of cancers. This study investigated the clinical significance of WARS1 expression as a biomarker in gastric cancer tissues obtained from patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (GC) who underwent radical resection. WARS1 expression in GC tissues and adjacent normal gastric mucosa of 253 patients with pStage II/III GC who underwent curative resection was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Association of WARS1 expression levels, categorized into high and low expression based on the median expression levels, with clinicopathological factors and overall survival (OS) of these patients was assessed. The low-WARS1 expression group had significantly higher serosal invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and pathological stage than did the high-WARS1 expression group. OS was significantly worse in the low- than in the high-WARS1 expression group (5-year survival 52.2% vs. 75.9%; p=0.0001). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, low WARS1 expression was an independent predictor for poor OS (hazard ratio=2.101; 95% confidence interval=1.328-3.322; p=0.002). In patients with locally advanced GC, after curative resection, WARS1 expression in GC tissue may be a useful prognostic marker.\n",
      "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with unfavorable outcomes. Developing therapeutic targets for TNBC remains a challenge. Here, we identified that acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1) is highly expressed in the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype of TNBC compared with adjacent normal tissues in our TNBC proteomics dataset. Inhibition of ACAA1 restrained TNBC proliferation and potentiated the response to the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor abemaciclib. Mechanistically, ACAA1 interacted with CDK4, and the inhibition of ACAA1 blocked RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) phosphorylation, resulting in G1-S cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, trimetazidine, a traditional drug for ischemic heart disease, caused a decrease in ACAA1 protein levels and enhanced the efficacy of abemaciclib in preclinical TNBC models. In conclusion, this study identifies that ACAA1 is a therapeutic target in TNBC and suggests the combination of trimetazidine and abemaciclib could be beneficial for ACAA1-high TNBCs. ACAA1 is highly expressed in TNBC, serving as a potential therapeutic target in ACAA1-high tumors and a predictive biomarker of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors for RB1-proficient patients.\n",
      "To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.\n",
      "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by α-synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which are sensitive to oxidative stress. Mitochondria aconitase 2 (ACO2) is an essential enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle that orchestrates mitochondrial and autophagic functions to energy metabolism. Though widely linked to diseases, its relation to PD has not been fully clarified. Here we revealed that the peripheral ACO2 activity was significantly decreased in PD patients and associated with their onset age and disease durations. The knock-in mouse and Drosophila models with the A252T variant displayed aggravated motor deficits and DA neuron degeneration after 6-OHDA and rotenone-induction, and the ACO2 knockdown or blockade cells showed features of mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction. Moreover, the transcription of autophagy-related genes LC3 and Atg5 was significantly downregulated via inhibited histone acetylation at the H3K9 and H4K5 sites. These data provided multi-dimensional evidences supporting the essential roles of ACO2, and as a potential early biomarker to be used in clinical trials for assessing the effects of antioxidants in PD. Moreover, ameliorating energy metabolism by targeting ACO2 could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n",
      "The pivotal role of lysosomal function in preserving neuronal homeostasis is recognized, with its dysfunction being implicated in neurodegenerative processes, notably in Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, the molecular underpinnings of lysosome-related genes (LRGs) in the context of PD remain partially elucidated. We collected RNA-seq data from the brain substantia nigra of 30 PD patients and 20 normal subjects from the GEO database. We obtained molecular classification clusters from the screened lysosomal expression patterns. The lysosome-related diagnostic model of Parkinson's disease was constructed by XGBoost and Random Forest. And we validated the expression patterns of signature LRGs in the diagnostic model by constructing a PD rat model. Finally, the linkage between PD and cancer through signature genes was explored. The expression patterns of the 33 LRGs screened can be divided into two groups of PD samples, enabling exploration of the variance in biological processes and immune elements. Cluster A had a higher disease severity. Subsequently, critical genes were sieved through the application of machine learning methodologies culminating in the identification of two intersecting feature genes (ACP2 and LRP2). A PD risk prediction model was constructed grounded on these signature genes. The model's validity was assessed through nomogram evaluation, which demonstrated robust confidence validity. Then we analyzed the correlation analysis, immune in-filtration, biological function, and rat expression validation of the two genes with common pathogenic genes in Parkinson's disease, indicating that these two genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. We then selected ACP2, which had a significant immune infiltration correlation, as the entry gene for the pan-cancer analysis. The pan-cancer analysis revealed that ACP2 has profound associations with prognostic indicators, immune infiltration, and tumor-related regulatory processes across various neoplasms, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in a range of human diseases, including PD and cancers. Our study comprehensively analyzed the molecular grouping of LRGs expression patterns in Parkinson's disease, and the disease progression was more severe in cluster A. And the PD diagnosis model related to LRGs is constructed. Finally, ACP2 is a potential target for the relationship between Parkinson's disease and tumor.\n",
      "Post-polio syndrome (PPS) refers to a clinical disorder affecting polio survivors with sequelae years after the initial polio attack. These patients report new musculoskeletal symptoms, loss of muscular strength or endurance. PPS patients are tired, in pain and experience new and unusual muscular deficits, on healthy muscles as well as deficient muscles initially affected by the Poliovirus. Once a clinical diagnosis is established, the therapeutic options can be discussed. Some pathophysiological mechanisms have been validated by research studies on PPS (inflammatory process in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and cytokines of the immune system). Several studies have been conducted to validate medications (pyridostigmine, immunoglobulin, coenzyme Q10) or physical exercises protocols. This article focuses on the relevance and efficacy that can be expected from these therapeutics. Very few studies reported some improvements. Medications combined to individual and supervised exercise training programs are promising therapeutic strategies for PPS patients care management.\n",
      "Forty years after the last endemic smallpox case, variola virus (VARV) is still considered a major threat to humans due to its possible use as a bioterrorism agent. For many years, the risk of disease reemergence was thought to solely be through deliberate misuse of VARV strains kept in clandestine laboratories. However, recent experiments using synthetic biology have proven the feasibility of recreating a poxvirus <i>de novo</i>, implying that VARV could, in theory, be resurrected. Because of this new perspective, the WHO Advisory Committee on VARV Research released new recommendations concerning research on poxviruses that strongly encourages pursuing the development of new antiviral drugs against orthopoxviruses. In 2018, the U.S. FDA advised in favor of two molecules for smallpox treatment, tecovirimat and brincidofovir. This review highlights the difficulties to develop new drugs targeting an eradicated disease, especially as it requires working under the FDA \"animal efficacy rule\" with the few, and imperfect, animal models available.\n"
