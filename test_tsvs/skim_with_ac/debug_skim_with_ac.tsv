0	657735	Diabetes	646	"['Although inflammation has long been known as a localized protective reaction of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection, characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function, there has been a new realization about its role in a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. While acute inflammation is a part of the defense response, chronic inflammation can lead to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological diseases. Several pro-inflammatory gene products have been identified that mediate a critical role in suppression of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Among these gene products are TNF and members of its superfamily, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, chemokines, MMP-9, VEGF, COX-2, and 5-LOX. The expression of all these genes are mainly regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is constitutively active in most tumors and is induced by carcinogens (such as cigarette smoke), tumor promoters, carcinogenic viral proteins (HIV-tat, HIV-nef, HIV-vpr, KHSV, EBV-LMP1, HTLV1-tax, HPV, HCV, and HBV), chemotherapeutic agents, and gamma-irradiation. These observations imply that anti-inflammatory agents that suppress NF-kappaB or NF-kappaB-regulated products should have a potential in both the prevention and treatment of cancer. The current review describes in detail the critical link between inflammation and cancer.', 'Diabetes causes metabolic and physiologic abnormalities in the retina, and these changes suggest a role for inflammation in the development of diabetic retinopathy. These changes include upregulation of iNOS, COX-2, ICAM-1, caspase 1, VEGF, and NF-kappaB, increased production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, IL-1beta, and cytokines, as well as increased permeability and leukostasis. Using selective pharmacologic inhibitors or genetically modified animals, an increasing number of therapeutic approaches have been identified that significantly inhibit development of at least the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, especially occlusion and degeneration of retinal capillaries. A common feature of a number of these therapies is that they inhibit production of inflammatory mediators. The concept that localized inflammatory processes play a role in the development of diabetic retinopathy is relatively new, but evidence that supports the hypothesis is accumulating rapidly. This new hypothesis offers new insight into the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, and offers novel targets to inhibit the ocular disease.', 'The Health Improvement Network (THIN) is a new medical records database that contains records from general practices some of which have or continue to participate in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and others that never participated in GPRD. We sought to replicate in THIN well-established associations from the medical literature and to compare results from the GPRD practices to the non-GPRD practices within THIN. Using THIN data from 1986-2003, we conducted case-control studies of associations between diseases (e.g., hypertension and stroke) and between diseases and drugs (e.g., aspirin and colon cancer). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios adjusted for potential confounders. Differences between GPRD and non-GPRD practices were assessed by testing for a statistical interaction by practice type in each outcome-exposure association. We observed the expected positive associations (p < 0.05) of stroke with hypertension and diabetes mellitus; of myocardial infarction with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and smoking; and of peptic ulcer disease with aspirin, NSAIDs, and potassium. We observed the expected negative associations (p < 0.05) of colorectal cancer with aspirin, NSAIDs, and cox-2 inhibitors. The expected protective effect of aspirin use for myocardial infarction was not observed. In all cases, the results obtained from the GPRD practices were similar to the results obtained from the non-GPRD practices, only being statistically different for the associations of myocardial infarction with diabetes and aspirin use. THIN data that are collected outside of the GPRD appear as valid as the data collected as part of the GPRD.', 'Leukocyte adhesion to the diabetic retinal vasculature results in blood-retinal barrier breakdown, capillary nonperfusion, and endothelial cell injury and death. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the leukocyte integrin CD18 are required for these processes. Diabetes was induced in Long Evans rats, resulting in a two- to threefold increase in retinal leukocyte adhesion. Following one week of diabetes, neutrophil CD11a, CD11b, and CD18 expression was increased significantly, as were retinal ICAM-1 levels. Animals were treated with aspirin, a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor (meloxicam), or a soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor/Fc construct (TNFR-Fc, etanercept). High-dose aspirin, etanercept, and high-dose meloxicam each reduced leukocyte adhesion and suppressed blood-retinal barrier breakdown. High-dose aspirin also reduced the expression of CD11a, CD11b, and CD18, whereas meloxicam and etanercept did not. High-dose aspirin, etanercept, and high-dose meloxicam each reduced retinal ICAM-1 expression. Aspirin and meloxicam both lowered retinal TNF-alpha levels. Notably, aspirin, meloxicam, and etanercept did not change retinal vascular endothelial growth factor levels. High-dose aspirin, etanercept and high-dose meloxicam, each suppressed the retinal expression of eNOS and the DNA-binding capacity of retinal nuclear factor-kappaB. High-dose aspirin also suppressed Erk kinase activity, which is involved in CD18 up-regulation. Taken together, these data identify COX-2 and TNF-alpha as operative in the early signature pathologies of diabetic retinopathy, a newly recognized inflammatory disease.', ""Curcumin, a yellow pigment in the Indian spice Turmeric (Curcuma longa), which is chemically known as diferuloylmethane, was first isolated exactly two centuries ago in 1815 by two German Scientists, Vogel and Pelletier. However, according to the pubmed database, the first study on its biological activity as an antibacterial agent was published in 1949 in Nature and the first clinical trial was reported in The Lancet in 1937. Although the current database indicates almost 9000 publications on curcumin, until 1990 there were less than 100 papers published on this nutraceutical. At the molecular level, this multitargeted agent has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of numerous cell signalling pathways including NF-ÎºB, STAT3, Nrf2, ROS and COX-2. Numerous studies have indicated that curcumin is a highly potent antimicrobial agent and has been shown to be active against various chronic diseases including various types of cancers, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, this compound has also been shown to be synergistic with other nutraceuticals such as resveratrol, piperine, catechins, quercetin and genistein. To date, over 100 different clinical trials have been completed with curcumin, which clearly show its safety, tolerability and its effectiveness against various chronic diseases in humans. However, more clinical trials in different populations are necessary to prove its potential against different chronic diseases in humans. This review's primary focus is on lessons learnt about curcumin from clinical trials. This article is part of a themed section on Principles of Pharmacological Research of Nutraceuticals.

Thus mono-targeted therapies developed for the last two decades for these diseases have proven to be unsafe, ineffective and expensive. Although fruits and vegetables are regarded to have therapeutic potential against chronic illnesses, neither their active component nor the mechanism of action is well understood. Resveratrol (trans-3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene), a component of grapes, berries, peanuts and other traditional medicines, is one such polyphenol that has been shown to mediate its effects through modulation of many different pathways. This stilbene has been shown to bind to numerous cell-signaling molecules such as multi drug resistance protein, topoisomerase II, aromatase, DNA polymerase, estrogen receptors, tubulin and F1-ATPase. Resveratrol has also been shown to activate various transcription factor (e.g; NFkappaB, STAT3, HIF-1alpha, beta-catenin and PPAR-gamma), suppress the expression of antiapoptotic gene products (e.g; Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), XIAP and survivin), inhibit protein kinases (e.g; src, PI3K, JNK, and AKT), induce antioxidant enzymes (e,g; catalase, superoxide dismutase and hemoxygenase-1), suppress the expression of inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., TNF, COX-2, iNOS, and CRP), inhibit the expression of angiogenic and metastatic gene products (e.g., MMPs, VEGF, cathepsin D, and ICAM-1), and modulate cell cycle regulatory genes (e.g., p53, Rb, PTEN, cyclins and CDKs). Numerous animal studies have demonstrated that this polyphenol holds promise against numerous age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. In view of these studies, resveratrol's prospects for use in the clinics are rapidly accelerating. Efforts are also underway to improve its activity in vivo through structural modification and reformulation. Our review describes various targets of resveratrol and their therapeutic potential."", 'RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products [AGEs]) plays a role in diabetic atherosclerosis. Recently, we have demonstrated enhanced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE synthase-1 (COX-2/mPGES-1) in human symptomatic plaques, and provided evidence that it is associated with metalloproteinase (MMP)-induced plaque rupture. However, the specific transmembrane signaling pathway(s) influencing plaque COX-2/mPGES-1 expression is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize RAGE expression in human plaques and to correlate it with the inflammatory infiltration, COX-2/mPGES-1 and MMP expression, and with clinical evidence of diabetes. Plaques obtained from 60 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic according to clinical evidence of type 2 diabetes. Plaques were subjected to analysis of RAGE, NF-kappaB, COX-2/mPGES-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9, lipid and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) content, and collagen content by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, whereas zymography was used to detect MMP activity. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify CD68+ macrophages, CD3+ T-lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and HLA-DR+ inflammatory cells. Diabetic plaques had more (P<0.0001) macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and HLA-DR+ cells, more (P<0.0001) immunoreactivity for RAGE, activated NF-kappaB, COX-2/mPGES-1, and MMPs, increased (P<0.0001) gelatinolytic activity, reduced (P<0.0001) collagen content, and increased (P<0.0001) lipid and oxLDL content. Interestingly, RAGE, COX-2/mPGES-1, and MMP expression was linearly correlated with plasma level of HbA1c. In conclusion, this study demonstrates in humans that RAGE overexpression is associated with enhanced inflammatory reaction and COX-2/mPGES-1 expression in diabetic plaque macrophages, and this effect may contribute to plaque destabilization by inducing culprit metalloproteinase expression.', 'Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm of every cell and translocates to the nucleus when activated. Its activation is induced by a wide variety of agents including stress, cigarette smoke, viruses, bacteria, inflammatory stimuli, cytokines, free radicals, carcinogens, tumor promoters, and endotoxins. On activation, NF-kappaB regulates the expression of almost 400 different genes, which include enzymes (e.g., COX-2, 5-LOX, and iNOS), cytokines (such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and chemokines), adhesion molecules, cell cycle regulatory molecules, viral proteins, and angiogenic factors. The constitutive activation of NF-kappaB has been linked with a wide variety of human diseases, including asthma, atherosclerosis, AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer\'s disease, and cancer. Several agents are known to suppress NF-kappaB activation, including Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10), interferons, endocrine hormones (LH, HCG, MSH, and GH), phytochemicals, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents. Because of the strong link of NF-kappaB with different stress signals, it has been called a ""smoke-sensor"" of the body.', 'Prostaglandins generated by cyclooxygenase (COX) have been implicated in hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. However, the role of individual COX isoenzymes as well as the molecular mechanisms linking oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes remains to be clarified. Human aortic endothelial cells were exposed to normal (5.5 mmol/L) and high (22.2 mmol/L) glucose. Glucose selectively increased mRNA and protein expression of COX-2. Its upregulation was associated with an increase of thromboxane A2 and a reduction of prostacyclin (PGI2) release. Glucose-induced activation of PKC resulted in the formation of peroxynitrite and tyrosine nitration of PGI2 synthase. NO release was reduced despite 2-fold increase of endothelial NO synthase expression. Phorbol ester caused an increase of COX-2 and endothelial NO synthase expression similar to that elicited by glucose. These effects were prevented by the PKC inhibitor calphostin C. N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, and calphostin C prevented ROS formation, restored NO release, and reduced colocalization of nitrotyrosine and PGI2 synthase. Expression of p22(phox), a subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase, was increased, and diphenyleneiodonium inhibited ROS formation. By contrast, indomethacin did not affect glucose-induced ROS generation. Thus, high glucose, via PKC signaling, induces oxidative stress and upregulation of COX-2, resulting in reduced NO availability and altered prostanoid profile.', 'The PREDIMED (PREvenciÃ³n con DIeta MEDiterrÃ¡nea) multicenter, randomized, primary prevention trial assessed the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on clinical events of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We randomized 7447 men and women at high CVD risk into three diets: MeDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), MeDiet supplemented with nuts, and control diet (advice on a low-fat diet). No energy restriction and no special intervention on physical activity were applied. We observed 288 CVD events (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke or CVD death) during a median time of 4.8years; hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.91) for the MeDiet+EVOO and 0.70 (CI, 0.53-0.94) for the MeDiet+nuts compared to the control group. Respective hazard ratios for incident diabetes (273 cases) among 3541 non-diabetic participants were 0.60 (0.43-0.85) and 0.82 (0.61-1.10) for MeDiet+EVOO and MeDiet+nuts, respectively versus control. Significant improvements in classical and emerging CVD risk factors also supported a favorable effect of both MeDiets on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, lipoprotein particles, inflammation, oxidative stress, and carotid atherosclerosis. In nutrigenomic studies beneficial effects of the intervention with MedDiets showed interactions with several genetic variants (TCF7L2, APOA2, MLXIPL, LPL, FTO, M4CR, COX-2, GCKR and SERPINE1) with respect to intermediate and final phenotypes. Thus, the PREDIMED trial provided strong evidence that a vegetable-based MeDiet rich in unsaturated fat and polyphenols can be a sustainable and ideal model for CVD prevention.']"	0.0614487510800821	0.5372071064802428	0.0178704805112174	36149	COX-2	96	['Human subjects consuming fish oil showed a significant suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in blood monocytes when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Results with a murine monocytic cell line (RAW 264.7) stably transfected with COX-2 promoter reporter gene also demonstrated that LPS-induced COX-2 expression was preferentially inhibited by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3), the major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) present in fish oil. Additionally, DHA and EPA significantly suppressed COX-2 expression induced by a synthetic lipopeptide, a TLR2 agonist. These results correlated with the preferential suppression of LPS- or lipopeptide-induced NF kappa B activation by DHA and EPA. The target of inhibition by DHA is TLR itself or its associated molecules, but not downstream signaling components. In contrast, COX-2 expression by TLR2 or TRL4 agonist was potentiated by lauric acid, a saturated fatty acid. These results demonstrate that inhibition of COX-2 expression by n-3 PUFAs is mediated through the modulation of TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, the beneficial or detrimental effects of different types of dietary fatty acids on the risk of the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases may be in part mediated through the modulation of TLRs.', 'The immune system is involved in host defense against infectious agents, tumor cells, and environmental insults. Inflammation is an important component of the early immunologic response. Inappropriate or dysfunctional immune responses underlie acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related compounds that have important roles in inflammation and in the regulation of immunity. Feeding fish oil results in partial replacement of AA in cell membranes by EPA. This leads to decreased production of AA-derived mediators, through several mechanisms, including decreased availability of AA, competition for cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, and decreased expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX. This alone is a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 FA. However, n-3 FA have a number of other effects that might occur downstream of altered eicosanoid production or might be independent of this effect. For example, dietary fish oil results in suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines and can modulate adhesion molecule expression. These effects occur at the level of altered gene expression. Fish oil feeding has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of some animal models of autoimmune disease and to protect against the effects of endotoxin. Clinical studies have reported that oral fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis and among some asthmatics, supporting the idea that the n-3 FA in fish oil are anti-inflammatory. There are indications that the inclusion of fish oil in enteral and parenteral formulae is beneficial to patients.', 'Epidemiological studies and laboratory animal model assays suggest that a high intake of dietary fat promotes colorectal cancer. Several in vivo and in vitro studies support the hypothesis that omega-6 fatty acids promote colon tumorigenesis, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lack promoting activity. Fat intake in the United States traditionally includes high amounts (30% of total caloric intake) of saturated fat rather than omega-6 fatty acids. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the modulatory effects of a high-fat diet containing mixed lipids (HFML), a diet rich in saturated fatty acids (the average American diet), a diet with fish oil (HFFO) that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and a low-fat corn oil diet (LFCO) on the formation of chemically induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumors, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity, and apoptosis during experimental colon carcinogenesis. At 5 weeks of age, groups of male F344 rats were fed a 5% corn oil diet (LFCO). At 7 weeks of age, rats intended for carcinogen treatment received s.c. injections of azoxymethane at a dose level of 15 mg/kg of body weight once weekly for 2 weeks. Beginning 1 day after the carcinogen treatment, groups of rats were then maintained on experimental diets containing 20% HFML or 20% HFFO. Rats were killed at 8, 23, or 38 weeks after azoxymethane treatment. Colonic ACF and tumors were evaluated histopathologically, and apoptosis was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling method. Colonic mucosae and tumor samples harvested at week 38 were analyzed for COX-2 synthetic activity and expression. The rats fed the HFML diet showed significantly increased total colonic ACF (P < 0.001-0.0001) with a multiplicity of > or = 4 aberrant crypts/focus (P < 0.0001) compared with the effects of the HFFO or LFCO diets at week 8, 23, and 38. Interestingly, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase (> or = 4) in multicrypt foci in rats given the HFML diet as compared with such foci in rats fed the HFFO or LFCO diets. By week 23, the HFML diet had significantly increased the incidence of colonic tumors (30-60%) and their multiplicity (100-141%) when compared with the effects of the LFCO or HFFO diets. At week 38, the HFML diet had induced 100% colon tumor incidence and a 4-fold multiplicity of adenocarcinomas compared with the LFCO and HFFO diets. At weeks 23 and 38, a significantly lower percentage of apoptotic colonic epithelial cells were observed in the tumors of animals fed the HFML diet as compared with those fed the HFFO diet. The HFML diet caused significantly increased levels of COX-2 activity in colon tumors (P < 0.05-0.01), and these tumors had enhanced levels of COX-2 expression as compared with those in assays with LFCO or HFFO diets. These observations demonstrate for the first time that HFML diets containing high levels of saturated fatty acids (such as those in Western diets) promote colon carcinogenesis. Although the mechanisms involved in colon tumor promotion by a HFML diet are not fully known, our results indicate that the modulation of eicosanoid production via the influence on COX activity and the suppression of apoptosis may play a key role in HFML diet-induced colon tumorigenesis.', 'Induction of NF-kappaB-mediated gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Curcumin, a phenolic antioxidant, inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB. We determined whether treatment with curcumin would prevent experimental ALD and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Four groups of rats (6 rats/group) were treated by intragastric infusion for 4 wk. One group received fish oil plus ethanol (FE); a second group received fish oil plus dextrose (FD). The third and fourth groups received FE or FD supplemented with 75 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) of curcumin. Liver samples were analyzed for histopathology, lipid peroxidation, NF-kappaB binding, TNF-alpha, IL-12, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitrotyrosine. Rats fed FE developed fatty liver, necrosis, and inflammation, which was accompanied by activation of NF-kappaB and the induction of cytokines, chemokines, COX-2, iNOS, and nitrotyrosine formation. Treatment with curcumin prevented both the pathological and biochemical changes induced by alcohol. Because endotoxin and the Kupffer cell are implicated in the pathogenesis of ALD, we investigated whether curcumin suppressed the stimulatory effects of endotoxin in isolated Kupffer cells. Curcumin blocked endotoxin-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and suppressed the expression of cytokines, chemokines, COX-2, and iNOS in Kupffer cells. Thus curcumin prevents experimental ALD, in part by suppressing induction of NF-kappaB-dependent genes.', 'This study describes specific molecular mechanisms by which supplementation with n-3 fatty acids (i.e. those present in fish oils) can modulate the expression and activity of degradative and inflammatory factors that cause cartilage destruction during arthritis. Our data show that incorporation of n-3 fatty acids (but not other polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acids) into articular cartilage chondrocyte membranes results in a dose-dependent reduction in: (i) the expression and activity of proteoglycan degrading enzymes (aggrecanases) and (ii) the expression of inflammation-inducible cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2), but not the constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase COX-1. These findings provide evidence that n-3 fatty acid supplementation can specifically affect regulatory mechanisms involved in chondrocyte gene transcription and thus further advocate a beneficial role for dietary fish oil supplementation in alleviation of several of the physiological parameters that cause and propogate arthritic disease.', 'Several epidemiological and experimental studies have indicated a strong relationship between different types of dietary fats and risk of colon cancer. However, the modulating effects of these nutritional factors at the molecular level are not fully elucidated. It has been documented that the modulation of tumorigenesis is associated with changes in the levels of prostaglandins production. To provide an understanding of the mechanism(s) of dietary fat-induced modulation of colon tumor development, we have analyzed the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in a critical step in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Male F344 rats were fed the semipurified AIN-76A diet containing low-fat corn oil and were s.c. injected azoxymethane (AOM) dissolved in normal saline at a dose rate of 15 mg/kg of body weight, once weekly, for 2 weeks. Vehicle controls received s.c. equal volumes of normal saline. One day after the second AOM or saline injection, rats intended to receive experimental diets were provided high-fat corn oil (HFCO) or high-fat fish oil (HFFO) mixed in semipurified AIN-76A diet, and the remaining rats continued to receive the low-fat corn oil diet. Animals were sacrificed 1, 12, or 36 weeks after the last AOM or saline injection, and their colonic mucosa, as well as the grossly visible colon tumors from rats sacrificed 36 weeks after the last AOM injection, were analyzed for the expression levels of COX-1 and COX-2. The results indicate that AOM induced increasingly high levels of COX-2 expression with advancing stages of colon tumorigenesis. HFCO further enhanced the AOM-induced COX-2 expression. In contrast, HFFO ingestion resulted in a significant decrease in COX-2 expression both in the colonic mucosa and in tumors. These results correlate with increased incidence and multiplicity of grossly visible colon tumors in AOM-treated animals that were fed the HFCO diet versus decreased tumor incidence and lower tumor multiplicity in animals that were fed the HFFO diet. No significant differences were observed in expression levels of COX-1. The data suggest that HFCO may promote colon tumorigenesis by up-regulating the COX-2 expression, whereas HFFO may exert its antitumor effect by inhibiting the COX-2 expression.', 'Inflammatory stimuli and lipid peroxidation up-regulate cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. This study evaluated the relationship between inflammatory mediators, COX expression, and pathological changes in experimental alcoholic liver disease. Rats (5 per group) were fed ethanol and a diet containing saturated fat, corn oil, or fish oil by intragastric infusion. Dextrose isocalorically replaced ethanol in controls. In the first set of experiments, whole livers were analyzed. In the second set of experiments, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes were isolated from rats in each group. Pathological analyses and measurements of lipid peroxidation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, COX-1 and COX-2 messenger RNA (mRNA), endotoxin, and liver and plasma thromboxane were performed. Increased expression of COX-2 mRNA was detected in the livers of rats showing necroinflammatory changes. The Kupffer cell was the cell primarily responsible for the increase in COX-2 mRNA level. Increased expression of COX-2 was associated with increased levels of endotoxin, TNF-alpha mRNA, lipid peroxidation, and synthesis of thromboxane. COX-1 mRNA was decreased in Kupffer cells in rats with the most severe liver injury. Up-regulation of COX-2 in alcoholic liver injury occurred in the presence of proinflammatory stimuli and resulted in increased synthesis of inflammatory and vasoactive eicosanoids. Down-regulation of COX-1 may result in decreased synthesis of cytoprotective eicosanoids and additionally exacerbate liver injury.', 'Several nutrients play a significant role in colorectal cancer development, and fats could be among the most determinant. While several studies have shown that the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic and its main dietary source, fish oil could exert important antineoplastic effects, much less is known about the effects of olive oil and its main fatty acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid. The aim of these studies is to assess the role of these nutrients in crucial processes involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. Caco-2 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells were supplemented with different fats and their role in apoptosis induction, cell proliferation, and differentiation was studied. COX-2 and Bcl-2 expressions were also assessed. Supplementation with fish oil or olive oil results in an induction of apoptosis and cell differentiation. The latest effect was also induced by oleic and linoleic acid. Fish oil diminishes significantly cell proliferation. Supplementation with fish oil and olive oil results in an early downregulation of COX-2 followed by a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. Fish oil and olive oil are capable of influencing crucial processes responsible for colorectal cancer development. COX-2 and Bcl-2 may be important mediators of some of these effects.', 'Alcoholic liver injury is more severe and rapidly developing in women than men. To evaluate the reason(s) for these gender-related differences, we determined whether pathogenic mechanisms important in alcoholic liver injury in male rats were further upregulated in female rats. Male and age-matched female rats (7/group) were fed ethanol and a diet containing fish oil for 4 wk by intragastric infusion. Dextrose isocalorically replaced ethanol in control rats. We analyzed liver histopathology, lipid peroxidation, cytochrome P-450 (CYP)2E1 activity, nonheme iron, endotoxin, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation, and mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Alcohol-induced liver injury was more severe in female vs. male rats. Female rats had higher endotoxin, lipid peroxidation, and nonheme iron levels and increased NF-kappa B activation and upregulation of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-2. CYP2E1 activity and TNF-alpha and COX-2 levels were similar in male and female rats. Remarkably, female rats fed fish oil and dextrose also showed necrosis and inflammation. Our findings in ethanol-fed rats suggest that increased endotoxemia and lipid peroxidation in females stimulate NF-kappa B activation and chemokine production, enhancing liver injury. TNF-alpha and COX-2 upregulation are probably important in causing liver injury but do not explain gender-related differences.', 'We investigated the potential of dietary saturated fatty acids to decrease endotoxemia and suppress expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in established alcohol-induced liver injury. Six groups (five rats/group) of male Wistar rats were studied. Rats in group 1 were fed a fish oil-ethanol diet for 6 weeks. Rats in groups 2, 3, and 4 were fed fish oil and ethanol for 6 weeks. Ethanol administration was stopped at this time, and the rats were switched to isocaloric diets containing dextrose with fish oil (group 2), palm oil (group 3), or medium-chain triglycerides (group 4) as the source of fat for an additional 2 weeks. Rats in groups 5 and 6 were fed fish oil-ethanol and fish oil-dextrose, respectively, for 8 weeks. Liver samples were analyzed for histopathology, lipid peroxidation, and levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for Cox-2 and TNF-alpha. Concentrations of endotoxin were determined in plasma. The most severe inflammation and fibrosis were detected in groups 1 and 5, as were the highest levels of endotoxin, lipid peroxidation, and mRNA for Cox-2 and TNF-alpha. After ethanol was discontinued, there was minimal histological improvement in group 2 but near normalization of the histology, including regression of fibrosis, in groups 3 and 4. Histological improvement was associated with decreased levels of endotoxin, lipid peroxidation, and reduced expression of Cox-2 and TNF-alpha. The data indicate that a diet enriched in saturated fatty acids (groups 3 and 4) effectively reverses alcohol-induced liver injury, including fibrosis. The therapeutic effects of saturated fatty acids may be explained, at least in part, by reduced endotoxemia and lipid peroxidation, which in turn result in decreased levels of TNF-alpha and Cox-2.']	0.20775012657002	7.080303933178968e-58	0.0091254752851711	10520	Fish oil	36691282	"['The National High Blood Pressure Education Program has released three Joint National Committee reports and a task force report on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure.

It also provides more emphasis on control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease; includes a discussion of the new cholesterol guidelines; recommends a reduction in alcohol consumption; and discusses the use of calcium and fish oil supplementation. This document expands earlier reports on special populations, including blacks and other racial and ethnic minority groups, young and elderly patients, pregnant patients, surgical candidates, and hypertensive patients with cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchial asthma, gout, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The report also updates previous drug tables to include new drugs, revised recommended doses of some drugs, and drug interactions. Consideration of step-down therapy after blood pressure has been controlled is suggested. This report is intended as a guide for practicing physicians and other health professionals in their care of hypertensive patients and as a reference for those participating in the many community high blood pressure control programs throughout the country.', 'Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease in Western and developing societies. A major metabolic abnormality of non-insulin-dependent diabetes is impaired insulin action (insulin resistance). Diets high in fat from vegetable and nonaquatic animal sources (rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and saturated fats) lead to insulin resistance. In rats fed high-fat diets, replacement of only 6 percent of the linoleic omega-6 fatty acids from safflower oil with long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil prevented the development of insulin resistance. The effect was most pronounced in the liver and skeletal muscle, which have important roles in glucose supply and demand. The results may be important for therapy or prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.', ""Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is essential for the growth and functional development of the brain in infants. DHA is also required for maintenance of normal brain function in adults. The inclusion of plentiful DHA in the diet improves learning ability, whereas deficiencies of DHA are associated with deficits in learning. DHA is taken up by the brain in preference to other fatty acids. The turnover of DHA in the brain is very fast, more so than is generally realized. The visual acuity of healthy, full-term, formula-fed infants is increased when their formula includes DHA. During the last 50 years, many infants have been fed formula diets lacking DHA and other omega-3 fatty acids. DHA deficiencies are associated with foetal alcohol syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, unipolar depression, aggressive hostility, and adrenoleukodystrophy. Decreases in DHA in the brain are associated with cognitive decline during aging and with onset of sporadic Alzheimer disease. The leading cause of death in western nations is cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between fish consumption and reduction in sudden death from myocardial infarction. The reduction is approximately 50% with 200 mg day(-1)of DHA from fish. DHA is the active component in fish. Not only does fish oil reduce triglycerides in the blood and decrease thrombosis, but it also prevents cardiac arrhythmias. The association of DHA deficiency with depression is the reason for the robust positive correlation between depression and myocardial infarction. Patients with cardiovascular disease or Type II diabetes are often advised to adopt a low-fat diet with a high proportion of carbohydrate. A study with women shows that this type of diet increases plasma triglycerides and the severity of Type II diabetes and coronary heart disease. DHA is present in fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel) and mother's milk. DHA is present at low levels in meat and eggs, but is not usually present in infant formulas. EPA, another long-chain n-3 fatty acid, is also present in fatty fish. The shorter chain n-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid, is not converted very well to DHA in man. These longchain n-3 fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) are now becoming available in some foods, especially infant formula and eggs in Europe and Japan. Fish oil decreases the proliferation of tumour cells, whereas arachidonic acid, a longchain n-6 fatty acid, increases their proliferation. These opposite effects are also seen with inflammation, particularly with rheumatoid arthritis, and with asthma. DHA has a positive effect on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and some cancers."", 'Data from laboratory studies, observational research, and/or secondary prevention trials suggest that vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids may reduce risk for cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD), but primary prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations (i.e., unselected for disease risk) are lacking. The ongoing VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D (in the form of vitamin D(3) [cholecalciferol], 2000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (Omacor fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 1g/day) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and CVD among a multi-ethnic population of 20,000 U.S. men aged â¥ 50 and women aged â¥ 55. The mean treatment period will be 5 years. Baseline blood samples will be collected in at least 16,000 participants, with follow-up blood collection in about 6000 participants. Yearly follow-up questionnaires will assess treatment compliance (plasma biomarker measures will also assess compliance in a random sample of participants), use of non-study drugs or supplements, occurrence of endpoints, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints will be confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths will be ascertained through national registries and other sources. Ancillary studies will investigate whether these agents affect risk for diabetes and glucose intolerance; hypertension; cognitive decline; depression; osteoporosis and fracture; physical disability and falls; asthma and other respiratory diseases; infections; and rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid diseases, and other autoimmune disorders.', ""Both insulin resistance (type II diabetes) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the role of Abeta oligomer-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation leading to phosphorylation and degradation of the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). IRS-1 couples insulin and other trophic factor receptors to downstream kinases and neuroprotective signaling. Increased phospho-IRS-1 is found in AD brain and insulin-resistant tissues from diabetics. Here, we report Abeta oligomers significantly increased active JNK and phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser616) and tau (Ser422) in cultured hippocampal neurons, whereas JNK inhibition blocked these responses. The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) similarly inhibited JNK and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and tau in cultured hippocampal neurons. Feeding 3xTg-AD transgenic mice a diet high in saturated and omega-6 fat increased active JNK and phosphorylated IRS-1 and tau. Treatment of the 3xTg-AD mice on high-fat diet with fish oil or curcumin or a combination of both for 4 months reduced phosphorylated JNK, IRS-1, and tau and prevented the degradation of total IRS-1. This was accompanied by improvement in Y-maze performance. Mice fed with fish oil and curcumin for 1 month had more significant effects on Y-maze, and the combination showed more significant inhibition of JNK, IRS-1, and tau phosphorylation. These data indicate JNK mediates Abeta oligomer inactivation of IRS-1 and phospho-tau pathology and that dietary treatment with fish oil/DHA, curcumin, or a combination of both has the potential to improve insulin/trophic signaling and cognitive deficits in AD."", 'Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.', 'The highly processed, calorie-dense, nutrient-depleted diet favored in the current American culture frequently leads to exaggerated supraphysiological post-prandial spikes in blood glucose and lipids. This state, called post-prandial dysmetabolism, induces immediate oxidant stress, which increases in direct proportion to the increases in glucose and triglycerides after a meal. The transient increase in free radicals acutely triggers atherogenic changes including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Post-prandial dysmetabolism is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events even in nondiabetic individuals. Improvements in diet exert profound and immediate favorable changes in the post-prandial dysmetabolism. Specifically, a diet high in minimally processed, high-fiber, plant-based foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts will markedly blunt the post-meal increase in glucose, triglycerides, and inflammation. Additionally, lean protein, vinegar, fish oil, tea, cinnamon, calorie restriction, weight loss, exercise, and low-dose to moderate-dose alcohol each positively impact post-prandial dysmetabolism. Experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that eating patterns, such as the traditional Mediterranean or Okinawan diets, that incorporate these types of foods and beverages reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk. This anti-inflammatory diet should be considered for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and diabetes.', 'The incidence of the insulin resistance syndrome has increased at an alarming rate worldwide, creating a serious challenge to public health care in the 21st century. Recently, epidemiological studies have associated the prevalence of type 2 diabetes with elevated body burdens of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, experimental evidence demonstrating a causal link between POPs and the development of insulin resistance is lacking. We investigated whether exposure to POPs contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 28 days to lipophilic POPs through the consumption of a high-fat diet containing either refined or crude fish oil obtained from farmed Atlantic salmon. In addition, differentiated adipocytes were exposed to several POP mixtures that mimicked the relative abundance of organic pollutants present in crude salmon oil. We measured body weight, whole-body insulin sensitivity, POP accumulation, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and gene expression and we performed microarray analysis. Adult male rats exposed to crude, but not refined, salmon oil developed insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, and hepatosteatosis. The contribution of POPs to insulin resistance was confirmed in cultured adipocytes where POPs, especially organochlorine pesticides, led to robust inhibition of insulin action. Moreover, POPs induced down-regulation of insulin-induced gene-1 (Insig-1) and Lpin1, two master regulators of lipid homeostasis. Our findings provide evidence that exposure to POPs commonly present in food chains leads to insulin resistance and associated metabolic disorders.', 'This article provides information and a commentary on trials presented at the American Heart Association meeting held in November 2005, relevant to the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of heart failure. All reports should be considered as preliminary data, as analyses may change in the final publication. In REPAIR-AMI an improvement in ejection fraction was observed in post-MI patients following infusion of bone marrow stem cells. However, the ASTAMI study showed no benefit of stem cell implantation in a similar patient cohort. The JELIS study reported a reduction in major coronary events in patients receiving statins plus fish oil compared to statins alone. MEGA showed that low dose statins in a low risk population reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events. Two studies of levosimendan in acute heart failure gave conflicting results, in the REVIVE-II study levosimendan was reported to have a superior effect on the composite primary outcome compared to placebo, however, in SURVIVE despite a trend to early benefit with levosimendan, there was no difference in effect on long-term outcome versus dobutamine. The PROACTIVE study showed encouraging results for the use of pioglitazone in post-myocardial infarction patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes.', 'Information is lacking on the potential effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the adipose tissue of patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated whether n-3 PUFAs have additional effects on adiposity, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue function (production of adipokines and inflammatory and atherogenic factors), and gene expression in type 2 diabetes. Twenty-seven women with type 2 diabetes without hypertriglyceridemia were randomly allocated in a double-blind parallel design to 2 mo of 3 g/d of either fish oil (1.8 g n-3 PUFAs) or placebo (paraffin oil). Although body weight and energy intake measured by use of a food diary were unchanged, total fat mass (P < 0.019) and subcutaneous adipocyte diameter (P < 0.0018) were lower in the fish oil group than in the placebo group. Insulin sensitivity was not significantly different between the 2 groups (measured by homeostasis model assessment in all patients and by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in a subgroup of 5 patients per group). By contrast, atherogenic risk factors, including plasma triacylglycerol (P < 0.03), the ratio of triacylglycerol to HDL cholesterol (atherogenic index, P < 0.03), and plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P < 0.01), were lower in the fish oil group than in the placebo group. In addition, a subset of inflammation-related genes was reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue after the fish oil, but not the placebo, treatment. A moderate dose of n-3 PUFAs for 2 mo reduced adiposity and atherogenic markers without deterioration of insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Some adipose tissue inflammation-related genes were also reduced. These beneficial effects could be linked to morphologic and inflammatory changes in adipose tissue.

It states that diabetes causes metabolic and physiological abnormalities in the retina, which include the upregulation of several inflammatory markers, including COX-2. This direct mention establishes a clear link between the gene COX-2 and the pathophysiological changes occurring in diabetes.  2. **Role of COX-2 in Diabetic Retinopathy**: The abstract discusses the role of inflammation in the development of diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. It notes that COX-2, along with other inflammatory mediators, is increased in diabetic conditions. This increase is significant because it contributes to the pathogenic processes leading to retinal damage, which is a critical aspect of diabetic retinopathy.  3. **Therapeutic Approaches Targeting COX-2**: The text also highlights that several therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators, including COX-2, have been identified.

It discusses the use of a COX-2 inhibitor (meloxicam) in a study involving diabetic rats. This direct mention establishes a clear connection between the gene COX-2 and the disease diabetes.  2. **Mechanism of Action**: The abstract details how the inhibition of COX-2 affects various pathological processes in diabetes, particularly in the retina. It mentions that high-dose aspirin, a COX-2 inhibitor, reduced leukocyte adhesion and suppressed blood-retinal barrier breakdown, which are significant complications in diabetic retinopathy. This indicates that COX-2 plays a role in the inflammatory and vascular changes associated with diabetes.  3. **Effects of COX-2 Inhibition**: The text further explains that high-dose aspirin, which inhibits COX-2, also reduced the expression of CD11a, CD11b, and CD18, and retinal ICAM-1 levels.

COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) is a well-known gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation and pain.  2. **Connection to Diabetes**: Diabetes is characterized by chronic inflammation and is often associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers, including prostaglandins. Since curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties and is shown to suppress the activity of COX-2, it is relevant to explore how curcumin might interact with diabetic pathways, potentially influencing the expression or activity of COX-2 in diabetes.  3. **Curcumin's Role in Chronic Diseases**: The abstract mentions that curcumin has been shown to be active against various chronic diseases, including diabetes. This broadens the relevance of COX-2 as a target for curcumin in the context of diabetes management or treatment.  4. **Potential Therapeutic Implications**: Given that curcumin is described as a multitargeted agent with anti-inflammatory effects, its interaction with COX-2 could be significant in the therapeutic management of diabetes, particularly in reducing inflammation-related complications associated with the disease.  5. **Scientific and Clinical Relevance**: The mention of numerous studies and clinical trials involving curcumin, including its effects on COX-2, underscores the importance of understanding these interactions in a clinical and therapeutic context, especially for chronic diseases like diabetes.

It states that glucose selectively increased mRNA and protein expression of COX-2 in human aortic endothelial cells. This direct mention establishes a clear link between the gene COX-2 and the physiological changes observed in diabetes.  2. **Mechanistic Insights Involving COX-2**: The abstract further explores the consequences of COX-2 upregulation in diabetic conditions. It is noted that the increase in COX-2 expression is associated with an increase in thromboxane A2 and a reduction in prostacyclin (PGI2) release. These changes in prostanoid profile are significant as they influence vascular function and could contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes-related complications.  3. **Role of COX-2 in Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Dysfunction**: The abstract discusses how the upregulation of COX-2, induced by high glucose levels, leads to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. This is a critical aspect of diabetes, where endothelial dysfunction is a common complication. The linkage of COX-2 expression to these pathological changes underscores the gene's relevance in the context of diabetes.  4. **Interaction with Other Molecular Pathways**: The text also describes how the activation of PKC and the formation of peroxynitrite and tyrosine nitration of PGI2 synthase are involved in the process.

This directly links the drug (fish oil) to the gene (COX-2), which is central to the hypothesis.  2. **Mechanism of Action**: The abstract details how the suppression of COX-2 by fish oil is mediated through the modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. This provides a mechanistic insight into how fish oil interacts with the biological pathways involving COX-2, supporting the hypothesis of an interaction between the drug and the gene.  3. **Specific Fatty Acids Identified**: It is specifically noted that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in fish oil, preferentially inhibit COX-2 expression. This specificity further supports the direct interaction between components of fish oil and the COX-2 gene.  4. **Experimental Evidence**: The use of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including the use of a murine monocytic cell line (RAW 264.7) stably transfected with a COX-2 promoter reporter gene, provides robust evidence of the interaction between fish oil and COX-2.  5. **Implications for Disease**: The abstract also discusses the broader implications of this interaction in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases, suggesting that the effects of dietary fatty acids on inflammation and disease risk may be mediated through their interaction with TLRs and COX-2.

In vitro, thiazolidinediones promote adipocyte differentiation of preadipocyte and mesenchymal stem cell lines; however, the molecular basis for this adipogenic effect has remained unclear. Here, we report that thiazolidinediones are potent and selective activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily recently shown to function in adipogenesis. The most potent of these agents, BRL49653, binds to PPAR gamma with a Kd of approximately 40 nM. Treatment of pluripotent C3H10T1/2 stem cells with BRL49653 results in efficient differentiation to adipocytes. These data are the first demonstration of a high affinity PPAR ligand and provide strong evidence that PPAR gamma is a molecular target for the adipogenic effects of thiazolidinediones. Furthermore, these data raise the intriguing possibility that PPAR gamma is a target for the therapeutic actions of this class of compounds.', 'Patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. There is indirect evidence that agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) could reduce macrovascular complications. Our aim, therefore, was to ascertain whether pioglitazone reduces macrovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. We did a prospective, randomised controlled trial in 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes who had evidence of macrovascular disease. We recruited patients from primary-care practices and hospitals. We assigned patients to oral pioglitazone titrated from 15 mg to 45 mg (n=2605) or matching placebo (n=2633), to be taken in addition to their glucose-lowering drugs and other medications. Our primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, non fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or surgical intervention in the coronary or leg arteries, and amputation above the ankle. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN NCT00174993. Two patients were lost to follow-up, but were included in analyses. The average time of observation was 34.5 months. 514 of 2605 patients in the pioglitazone group and 572 of 2633 patients in the placebo group had at least one event in the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80-1.02, p=0.095). The main secondary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. 301 patients in the pioglitazone group and 358 in the placebo group reached this endpoint (0.84, 0.72-0.98, p=0.027). Overall safety and tolerability was good with no change in the safety profile of pioglitazone identified. 6% (149 of 2065) and 4% (108 of 2633) of those in the pioglitazone and placebo groups, respectively, were admitted to hospital with heart failure; mortality rates from heart failure did not differ between groups. Pioglitazone reduces the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes who have a high risk of macrovascular events.', 'Extensive research during the past 2 decades has revealed the mechanism by which continued oxidative stress can lead to chronic inflammation, which in turn could mediate most chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors including NF-ÎºB, AP-1, p53, HIF-1Î±, PPAR-Î³, Î²-catenin/Wnt, and Nrf2. Activation of these transcription factors can lead to the expression of over 500 different genes, including those for growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell cycle regulatory molecules, and anti-inflammatory molecules. How oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways leading to transformation of a normal cell to tumor cell, tumor cell survival, proliferation, chemoresistance, radioresistance, invasion, angiogenesis, and stem cell survival is the focus of this review. Overall, observations to date suggest that oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and cancer are closely linked.', 'Adiponectin (also known as 30-kDa adipocyte complement-related protein; Acrp30) is a hormone secreted by adipocytes that acts as an antidiabetic and anti-atherogenic adipokine. Levels of adiponectin in the blood are decreased under conditions of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Administration of adiponectin causes glucose-lowering effects and ameliorates insulin resistance in mice. Conversely, adiponectin-deficient mice exhibit insulin resistance and diabetes. This insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin seems to be mediated by an increase in fatty-acid oxidation through activation of AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha. Here we report the cloning of complementary DNAs encoding adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) by expression cloning. AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. These two adiponectin receptors are predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains, but to be structurally and functionally distinct from G-protein-coupled receptors. Expression of AdipoR1/R2 or suppression of AdipoR1/R2 expression by small-interfering RNA supports our conclusion that they serve as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin, and that they mediate increased AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha ligand activities, as well as fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin.', 'The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of three nuclear receptor isoforms, PPAR gamma, PPAR alpha, and PPAR delta, encoded by different genes. PPARs are ligand-regulated transcription factors that control gene expression by binding to specific response elements (PPREs) within promoters. PPARs bind as heterodimers with a retinoid X receptor and, upon binding agonist, interact with cofactors such that the rate of transcription initiation is increased. The PPARs play a critical physiological role as lipid sensors and regulators of lipid metabolism. Fatty acids and eicosanoids have been identified as natural ligands for the PPARs. More potent synthetic PPAR ligands, including the fibrates and thiazolidinediones, have proven effective in the treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes. Use of such ligands has allowed researchers to unveil many potential roles for the PPARs in pathological states including atherosclerosis, inflammation, cancer, infertility, and demyelination. Here, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of PPAR action and the involvement of the PPARs in the etiology and treatment of several chronic diseases.', 'Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the lynchpin between steatosis and cirrhosis in the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disorders (NAFLD), was barely recognized in 1981. NAFLD is now present in 17% to 33% of Americans, has a worldwide distribution, and parallels the frequency of central adiposity, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NASH could be present in one third of NAFLD cases. Age, activity of steatohepatitis, and established fibrosis predispose to cirrhosis, which has a 7- to 10-year liver-related mortality of 12% to 25%. Many cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis are likely endstage NASH. While endstage NAFLD currently accounts for 4% to 10% of liver transplants, this may soon rise. Pathogenic concepts for NAFLD/NASH must account for the strong links with overnutrition and underactivity, insulin resistance, and genetic factors. Lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, cytokines, and other proinflammatory mediators may each play a role in transition of steatosis to NASH. The present ""gold standard"" management of NASH is modest weight reduction, particularly correction of central obesity achieved by combining dietary measures with increased physical activity. Whether achieved by ""lifestyle adjustment"" or anti-obesity surgery, this improves insulin resistance and reverses steatosis, hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. The same potential for ""unwinding"" fibrotic NASH is indicated by studies of the peroxisome proliferation activator receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist ""glitazones,"" but these agents may improve liver disease at the expense of worsening obesity. Future challenges are to approach NAFLD as a preventive public health initiative and to motivate affected persons to adopt a healthier lifestyle.', 'The nuclear hormone receptor PPAR gamma promotes adipogenesis and macrophage differentiation and is a primary pharmacological target in the treatment of type II diabetes. Here, we show that PPAR gamma gene knockout results in two independent lethal phases. Initially, PPAR gamma deficiency interferes with terminal differentiation of the trophoblast and placental vascularization, leading to severe myocardial thinning and death by E10.0. Supplementing PPAR gamma null embryos with wild-type placentas via aggregation with tetraploid embryos corrects the cardiac defect, implicating a previously unrecognized dependence of the developing heart on a functional placenta. A tetraploid-rescued mutant surviving to term exhibited another lethal combination of pathologies, including lipodystrophy and multiple hemorrhages. These findings both confirm and expand the current known spectrum of physiological functions regulated by PPAR gamma.', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. In high-risk subjects, the earliest detectable abnormality is insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Impaired insulin-mediated signaling, gene expression, glycogen synthesis, and accumulation of intramyocellular triglycerides have all been linked with insulin resistance, but no specific defect responsible for insulin resistance and DM has been identified in humans. To identify genes potentially important in the pathogenesis of DM, we analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from healthy metabolically characterized nondiabetic (family history negative and positive for DM) and diabetic Mexican-American subjects. We demonstrate that insulin resistance and DM associate with reduced expression of multiple nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)-dependent genes encoding key enzymes in oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function. Although NRF-1 expression is decreased only in diabetic subjects, expression of both PPAR gamma coactivator 1-alpha and-beta (PGC1-alpha/PPARGC1 and PGC1-beta/PERC), coactivators of NRF-1 and PPAR gamma-dependent transcription, is decreased in both diabetic subjects and family history-positive nondiabetic subjects. Decreased PGC1 expression may be responsible for decreased expression of NRF-dependent genes, leading to the metabolic disturbances characteristic of insulin resistance and DM.', 'In developed societies, chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis and cancer are responsible for most deaths. These ailments have complex causes involving genetic, environmental and nutritional factors. There is evidence that a group of closely related nuclear receptors, called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), may be involved in these diseases. This, together with the fact that PPAR activity can be modulated by drugs such as thiazolidinediones and fibrates, has instigated a huge research effort into PPARs. Here we present the latest developments in the PPAR field, with particular emphasis on the physiological function of PPARs during various nutritional states, and the possible role of PPARs in several chronic diseases.', ""Obesity and the related disorders of dyslipidemia and diabetes (components of syndrome X) have become global health epidemics. Over the past decade, the elucidation of key regulators of energy balance and insulin signaling have revolutionized our understanding of fat and sugar metabolism and their intimate link. The three 'lipid-sensing' peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma and PPAR-delta) exemplify this connection, regulating diverse aspects of lipid and glucose homeostasis, and serving as bona fide therapeutic targets. With molecular underpinnings now in place, new pharmacologic approaches to metabolic disease and new questions are emerging.""]"	1.5694462633791582	0.0	0.1558346094946401	16325	PPAR	95	"['Endocannabinoids and N-acylethanolamines are lipid mediators regulating a wide range of biological functions including food intake. We investigated short-term effects of feeding rats five different dietary fats (palm oil (PO), olive oil (OA), safflower oil (LA), fish oil (FO) and arachidonic acid (AA)) on tissue levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide, oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, stearoylethanolamide, linoleoylethanolamide, eicosapentaenoylethanolamide, docosahexaenoylethanolamide and tissue fatty acid composition. The LA-diet increased linoleoylethanolamide and linoleic acid in brain, jejunum and liver. The OA-diet increased brain levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide (not 2-arachidonoylglycerol) without changing tissue fatty acid composition. The same diet increased oleoylethanolamide in liver. All five dietary fats decreased oleoylethanolamide in jejunum without changing levels of anandamide, suggesting that dietary fat may have an orexigenic effect. The AA-diet increased anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in jejunum without effect on liver. The FO-diet decreased liver levels of all N-acylethanolamines (except eicosapentaenoylethanolamide and docosahexaenoylethanolamide) with similar changes in precursor lipids. The AA-diet and FO-diet had no effect on N-acylethanolamines, endocannabinoids or precursor lipids in brain. All N-acylethanolamines activated PPAR-alpha. In conclusion, short-term feeding of diets resembling human diets (Mediterranean diet high in monounsaturated fat, diet high in saturated fat, or diet high in polyunsaturated fat) can affect tissue levels of endocannabinoids and N-acylethanolamines.', 'Recent studies have shown that fish oil, containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5 omega 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 omega 3) retard the progression of renal disease, especially in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Despite increasing knowledge of the beneficial effects of fish oils, little is known about the mechanisms of action of omega-3 PUFAs. It has been reported that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines. Both EPA and DHA have been shown to activate PPARs. The aim of this study was to examine if omega-3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory effects via activation of PPARs in human renal tubular cells. An immortalized human proximal tubular cell line [human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells] was used in all experiments. Conditioned media was collected from omega-3 PUFAs- treated cells and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the above cells for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nuclear Extracts were prepared from the HK-2 cells for transcription factor activation assay. Both EPA and DHA at 10 micromol/L and 100 micromol/L concentrations effectively decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression. EPA and DHA also increased both PPAR-gamma mRNA and protein activity (two- to threefold) in HK-2 cells. A dose of 100 micromol/L bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) abolished the PPAR-gamma activation induced by both EPA and DHA and removed the inhibitory effect of EPA and DHA on LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in HK-2 cells. Overexpression of PPAR-gamma further inhibited NF-kappaB activation compared to the control cells in the presence of EPA and DHA. Our data demonstrate that both EPA and DHA down-regulate LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB via a PPAR-gamma-dependent pathway in HK-2 cells. These results suggest that PPAR-gamma activation by EPA and DHA may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the beneficial effects of fish oil.', 'Adiponectin has insulin-sensitizing, antiatherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties, but little is known about factors that regulate its secretion. To examine the effect of fish oil on adiponectin secretion, mice were fed either a control diet or isocaloric diets containing 27% safflower oil or 27, 13.5, and 8% menhaden fish oil. Within 15 days, fish oil feeding raised plasma adiponectin concentrations two- to threefold in a dose-dependent manner, and the concentrations remained approximately twofold higher for 7 days when the fish oil diet was replaced by the safflower oil diet. Within 24 h, fish oil markedly induced transcription of the adiponectin gene in epididymal adipose tissue but not in subcutaneous fat. The increase of plasma adiponectin by fish oil was completely blocked by administration of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma inhibitor bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether. In contrast, there was no effect of fish oil feeding on adiponectin secretion in PPARalpha-null mice. These data suggest that fish oil is a naturally occurring potent regulator of adiponectin secretion in vivo and that it does so through a PPARgamma-dependent and PPARalpha-independent manner in epididymal fat.', 'Recent studies have suggested that n-3 fatty acids, abundant in fish oil, protect against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha activation and a subsequent decrease in intracellular lipid abundance. To directly test this hypothesis, we fed PPAR-alpha null and wild-type mice for 2 weeks with isocaloric high-fat diets containing 27% fat from either safflower oil or safflower oil with an 8% fish oil replacement (fish oil diet). In both genotypes the safflower oil diet blunted insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production (P < 0.02 vs. genotype control) and PEPCK gene expression. Feeding wild-type mice a fish oil diet restored hepatic insulin sensitivity (hepatic glucose production [HGP], P < 0.002 vs. wild-type mice fed safflower oil), whereas in contrast, in PPAR-alpha null mice failed to counteract hepatic insulin resistance (HGP, P = NS vs. PPAR-alpha null safflower oil-fed mice). In PPAR-alpha null mice fed the fish oil diet, safflower oil plus fish oil, hepatic insulin resistance was dissociated from increases in hepatic triacylglycerol and acyl-CoA but accompanied by a more than threefold increase in hepatic diacylglycerol concentration (P < 0.0001 vs. genotype control). These data support the hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids protect from high-fat diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance in a PPAR-alpha-and diacylglycerol-dependent manner.', 'Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been proposed as important pharmaco-nutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated the ability of CLA and n-3 PUFA alone or in combination to modulate IBD in a pig model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Sixty-four, 15-day-old pigs were used to evaluate the effect of CLA, n-3 PUFA and a 50:50 mixture of CLA and n-3 PUFA on growth, clinical activity and colonic PPAR-responsive gene expression. Diets were formulated to contain: 1.33% soybean oil (control); 1.33% CLA; 1.33% fish oil; or 1.33% of a 50:50 mixture of CLA and fish oil. Intestinal inflammation was induced by an intragastric challenge with DSS on day 42 of dietary supplementation. The colonic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), PPAR gamma- and delta-responsive genes, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. The onset of IBD was delayed, colitis less severe and growth suppression attenuated in pigs fed CLA, which correlated with induction of colonic PPAR gamma and its responsive gene PPAR gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC1-alpha) and downregulation of TNF-alpha. However, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA alone or in combination with CLA resulted in an early onset of disease (i.e., day 2) and faster recovery on days 6 and 7, which correlated with a marked induction of the PPAR delta-responsive gene uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). CLA and n-3 PUFA acted synergistically to upregulate colonic KGF expression in DSS-challenged pigs but n-3 PUFA blocked CLA-induced PPAR gamma activation. Dietary CLA-supplementation upregulated colonic PPAR gamma expression and contributed to delaying the onset of experimental IBD, whereas n-3 PUFA failed to protect from IBD, although it accelerated colonic regeneration and clinical remission by activating PPAR delta.', ""n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3), are present in mammal tissues both from endogenous synthesis from desaturation and elongation of 18:3 n-3 and/or from dietary origin (marine products and fish oils). In rodents in vivo, n-3 LC-PUFA have a protective effect against high fat diet induced insulin resistance. Such an effect is explained at the molecular level by the prevention of many alterations of insulin signaling induced by a high fat diet. Indeed, the protective effect of n-3 LC-PUFA results from the following: (a) the prevention of the decrease of phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinase (PI3 kinase) activity and of the depletion of the glucose transporter protein GLUT4 in the muscle; (b) the prevention of the decreased expression of GLUT4 in adipose tissue. In addition, n-3 LC-PUFA inhibit both the activity and expression of liver glucose-6-phosphatase which could explain the protective effect with respect to the excessive hepatic glucose output induced by a high fat diet. n-3 LC-PUFA also decrease muscle intramyofibrillar triglycerides and liver steatosis. This last effect results on the one hand, from a decreased expression of lipogenesis enzymes and of delta 9 desaturase (via a depleting effect on sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). On the other hand, n-3 LC-PUFA stimulate fatty acid oxidation in the liver (via the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha)). In patients with type 2 diabetes, fish oil dietary supplementation fails to reverse insulin resistance for unclear reasons, but systematically decreases plasma triglycerides. Conversely, in healthy humans, fish oil has many physiological effects. Indeed, fish oil reduces insulin response to oral glucose without altering the glycaemic response, abolishes extraggression at times of mental stress, decreases the activation of sympathetic activity during mental stress and also decreases plasma triglycerides. These effects are encouraging in the perspective of prevention of insulin resistance but further clinical and basic studies must be designed to confirm and complete our knowledge in this field."", 'Compelling evidence exists for the cardioprotective benefits resulting from consumption of fatty acids from fish oils, EPA (20:5n-3) and DHA (22:6n-3). EPA and DHA alter membrane fluidity, interact with transcription factors such as PPAR and sterol regulatory element binding protein, and are substrates for enzymes including cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450. As a result, fish oils may improve cardiovascular health by altering lipid metabolism, inducing haemodynamic changes, decreasing arrhythmias, modulating platelet function, improving endothelial function and inhibiting inflammatory pathways. The independent effects of EPA and DHA are poorly understood. While both EPA and DHA decrease TAG levels, only DHA appears to increase HDL and LDL particle size. Evidence to date suggests that DHA is more efficient in decreasing blood pressure, heart rate and platelet aggregation compared to EPA. Fish oil consumption appears to improve arterial compliance and endothelial function; it is not yet clear as to whether differences exist between EPA and DHA in their vascular effects. In contrast, the beneficial effect of fish oils on inflammation and insulin sensitivity observed in vitro and in animal studies has not been confirmed in human subjects. Further investigation to clarify the relative effects of consuming EPA and DHA at a range of doses would enable elaboration of current understanding regarding cardioprotective effects of consuming oily fish and algal sources of long chain n-3 PUFA, and provide clearer evidence for the clinical therapeutic potential of consuming either EPA or DHA-rich oils.', 'Dietary supplementation with the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to rats preconditions the liver against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, with reduction of the enhanced nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) functionality occurring in the early phase of IR injury, and recovery of IR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that liver preconditioning by n-3 PUFA is exerted through peroxisone proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPAR-Î±) activation and interference with NF-ÎºB activation. For this purpose we evaluated the formation of PPAR-Î±/NF-ÎºBp65 complexes in relation to changes in PPAR-Î± activation, IÎºB-Î± phosphorylation and serum levels and expression of interleukin (IL)-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± in a model of hepatic IR-injury (1 h of ischemia and 20 h of reperfusion) or sham laparotomy (controls) in male Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were previously supplemented for 7 days with encapsulated fish oil (General Nutrition Corp., Pittsburg, PA) or isovolumetric amounts of saline (controls). Normalization of IR-altered parameters of liver injury (serum transaminases and liver morphology) was achieved by dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation. EPA and DHA suppression of the early IR-induced NF-ÎºB activation was paralleled by generation of PPAR-Î±/NF-ÎºBp65 complexes, in concomitance with normalization of the IR-induced IÎºB-Î± phosphorylation. PPAR-Î± activation by n-3 PUFA was evidenced by enhancement in the expression of the PPAR-Î±-regulated Acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox) and Carnitine-Palmitoyl-CoA transferase I (CPT-I) genes. Consistent with these findings, normalization of IR-induced expression and serum levels of NF-ÎºB-controlled cytokines IL-lÎ² and TNF-Î± was observed at 20 h of reperfusion. Taken together, these findings point to an antagonistic effect of PPAR-Î± on NF-ÎºB-controlled transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators. This effect is associated with the formation of PPAR-Î±/NF-ÎºBp65 complexes and enhanced cytosolic IÎºB-Î± stability, as major preconditioning mechanisms induced by n-3 PUFA supplementation against IR liver injury.', 'Omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in fish oil, improve the prognosis of several chronic inflammatory diseases although the mechanism for such effects remains unclear. These fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are highly polyunsaturated and readily undergo oxidation. We show that oxidized, but not native unoxidized, EPA significantly inhibited human neutrophil and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro by inhibiting endothelial adhesion receptor expression. In transcriptional coactivation assays, oxidized EPA potently activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), a member of the nuclear receptor family. In vivo, oxidized, but not native, EPA markedly reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion to venular endothelium of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. This occurred via a PPAR alpha-dependent mechanism because oxidized EPA had no such effect in LPS-treated PPAR alpha-deficient mice. Therefore, the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids may be explained by a PPAR alpha-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of oxidized EPA.', 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been recognized as a major health burden. It is the most important cause of chronic liver disease and a major independent cardiovascular risk factor. Lacking a definite treatment for NAFLD, a specific diet and an increase in physical activity represent the most commonly used therapeutic approaches. In this review, major literature data about the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) as a potential treatment of NAFLD have been described. n-3 PUFAs, besides having a beneficial impact on most of the cardio-metabolic risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis) by regulating gene transcription factors [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î±, PPARÎ³, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein], impacts both lipid metabolism and on insulin sensitivity. In addition to an enhancement of hepatic beta oxidation and a decrease of the endogenous lipid production, n-3 PUFAs are able to determine a significant reduction of the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-6) and of oxygen reactive species. Further strengthening the results of the in vitro studies, both animal models and human intervention trials, showed a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on the severity of NAFLD as expressed by laboratory parameters and imaging measurements. Despite available results provided encouraging data about the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs as a treatment of NAFLD in humans, well-designed randomized controlled trials of adequate size and duration, with histological endpoints, are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of PUFA, as well as other therapies, for the treatment of NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. It is worthwhile to consider that n-3 PUFAs cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from exogenous sources (fish oil, flaxseeds, olive oil) which are typical foods of the Mediterranean diet, known for its beneficial effects in preventing obesity, diabetes and, in turn, cardiovascular events. According to these data, it is important to consider that most of the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs can also be obtained by an equilibrate nutrition program.']"	0.2986690617699249	2.3937758329838912e-87	0.0090304182509505	10520	Fish oil	36691282	"['The National High Blood Pressure Education Program has released three Joint National Committee reports and a task force report on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure. Like its predecessors, the 1988 Joint National Committee report was developed using the consensus process; it is based on the latest scientific research and reflects the state of the art regarding hypertension management. This report updates findings of previous reports in several respects: it broadens the step-care approach to provide more flexibility for clinicians; encourages greater patient involvement in the treatment program; emphasizes a consideration of the quality of life in the management of patients; and addresses the cost of care. It also provides more emphasis on control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease; includes a discussion of the new cholesterol guidelines; recommends a reduction in alcohol consumption; and discusses the use of calcium and fish oil supplementation. This document expands earlier reports on special populations, including blacks and other racial and ethnic minority groups, young and elderly patients, pregnant patients, surgical candidates, and hypertensive patients with cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchial asthma, gout, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The report also updates previous drug tables to include new drugs, revised recommended doses of some drugs, and drug interactions. Consideration of step-down therapy after blood pressure has been controlled is suggested. This report is intended as a guide for practicing physicians and other health professionals in their care of hypertensive patients and as a reference for those participating in the many community high blood pressure control programs throughout the country.', 'Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease in Western and developing societies. A major metabolic abnormality of non-insulin-dependent diabetes is impaired insulin action (insulin resistance). Diets high in fat from vegetable and nonaquatic animal sources (rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and saturated fats) lead to insulin resistance. In rats fed high-fat diets, replacement of only 6 percent of the linoleic omega-6 fatty acids from safflower oil with long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil prevented the development of insulin resistance. The effect was most pronounced in the liver and skeletal muscle, which have important roles in glucose supply and demand. The results may be important for therapy or prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.', ""Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is essential for the growth and functional development of the brain in infants. DHA is also required for maintenance of normal brain function in adults. The inclusion of plentiful DHA in the diet improves learning ability, whereas deficiencies of DHA are associated with deficits in learning. DHA is taken up by the brain in preference to other fatty acids. The turnover of DHA in the brain is very fast, more so than is generally realized. The visual acuity of healthy, full-term, formula-fed infants is increased when their formula includes DHA. During the last 50 years, many infants have been fed formula diets lacking DHA and other omega-3 fatty acids. DHA deficiencies are associated with foetal alcohol syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, unipolar depression, aggressive hostility, and adrenoleukodystrophy. Decreases in DHA in the brain are associated with cognitive decline during aging and with onset of sporadic Alzheimer disease. The leading cause of death in western nations is cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between fish consumption and reduction in sudden death from myocardial infarction. The reduction is approximately 50% with 200 mg day(-1)of DHA from fish. DHA is the active component in fish. Not only does fish oil reduce triglycerides in the blood and decrease thrombosis, but it also prevents cardiac arrhythmias. The association of DHA deficiency with depression is the reason for the robust positive correlation between depression and myocardial infarction. Patients with cardiovascular disease or Type II diabetes are often advised to adopt a low-fat diet with a high proportion of carbohydrate. A study with women shows that this type of diet increases plasma triglycerides and the severity of Type II diabetes and coronary heart disease. DHA is present in fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel) and mother's milk. DHA is present at low levels in meat and eggs, but is not usually present in infant formulas. EPA, another long-chain n-3 fatty acid, is also present in fatty fish. The shorter chain n-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid, is not converted very well to DHA in man. These longchain n-3 fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) are now becoming available in some foods, especially infant formula and eggs in Europe and Japan. Fish oil decreases the proliferation of tumour cells, whereas arachidonic acid, a longchain n-6 fatty acid, increases their proliferation. These opposite effects are also seen with inflammation, particularly with rheumatoid arthritis, and with asthma. DHA has a positive effect on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and some cancers."", 'Data from laboratory studies, observational research, and/or secondary prevention trials suggest that vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids may reduce risk for cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD), but primary prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations (i.e., unselected for disease risk) are lacking. The ongoing VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D (in the form of vitamin D(3) [cholecalciferol], 2000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (Omacor fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 1g/day) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and CVD among a multi-ethnic population of 20,000 U.S. men aged â¥ 50 and women aged â¥ 55. The mean treatment period will be 5 years. Baseline blood samples will be collected in at least 16,000 participants, with follow-up blood collection in about 6000 participants. Yearly follow-up questionnaires will assess treatment compliance (plasma biomarker measures will also assess compliance in a random sample of participants), use of non-study drugs or supplements, occurrence of endpoints, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints will be confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths will be ascertained through national registries and other sources. Ancillary studies will investigate whether these agents affect risk for diabetes and glucose intolerance; hypertension; cognitive decline; depression; osteoporosis and fracture; physical disability and falls; asthma and other respiratory diseases; infections; and rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid diseases, and other autoimmune disorders.', ""Both insulin resistance (type II diabetes) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the role of Abeta oligomer-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation leading to phosphorylation and degradation of the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). IRS-1 couples insulin and other trophic factor receptors to downstream kinases and neuroprotective signaling. Increased phospho-IRS-1 is found in AD brain and insulin-resistant tissues from diabetics. Here, we report Abeta oligomers significantly increased active JNK and phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser616) and tau (Ser422) in cultured hippocampal neurons, whereas JNK inhibition blocked these responses. The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) similarly inhibited JNK and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and tau in cultured hippocampal neurons. Feeding 3xTg-AD transgenic mice a diet high in saturated and omega-6 fat increased active JNK and phosphorylated IRS-1 and tau. Treatment of the 3xTg-AD mice on high-fat diet with fish oil or curcumin or a combination of both for 4 months reduced phosphorylated JNK, IRS-1, and tau and prevented the degradation of total IRS-1. This was accompanied by improvement in Y-maze performance. Mice fed with fish oil and curcumin for 1 month had more significant effects on Y-maze, and the combination showed more significant inhibition of JNK, IRS-1, and tau phosphorylation. These data indicate JNK mediates Abeta oligomer inactivation of IRS-1 and phospho-tau pathology and that dietary treatment with fish oil/DHA, curcumin, or a combination of both has the potential to improve insulin/trophic signaling and cognitive deficits in AD."", 'Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.', 'The highly processed, calorie-dense, nutrient-depleted diet favored in the current American culture frequently leads to exaggerated supraphysiological post-prandial spikes in blood glucose and lipids. This state, called post-prandial dysmetabolism, induces immediate oxidant stress, which increases in direct proportion to the increases in glucose and triglycerides after a meal. The transient increase in free radicals acutely triggers atherogenic changes including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Post-prandial dysmetabolism is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events even in nondiabetic individuals. Improvements in diet exert profound and immediate favorable changes in the post-prandial dysmetabolism. Specifically, a diet high in minimally processed, high-fiber, plant-based foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts will markedly blunt the post-meal increase in glucose, triglycerides, and inflammation. Additionally, lean protein, vinegar, fish oil, tea, cinnamon, calorie restriction, weight loss, exercise, and low-dose to moderate-dose alcohol each positively impact post-prandial dysmetabolism. Experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that eating patterns, such as the traditional Mediterranean or Okinawan diets, that incorporate these types of foods and beverages reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk. This anti-inflammatory diet should be considered for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and diabetes.', 'The incidence of the insulin resistance syndrome has increased at an alarming rate worldwide, creating a serious challenge to public health care in the 21st century. Recently, epidemiological studies have associated the prevalence of type 2 diabetes with elevated body burdens of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, experimental evidence demonstrating a causal link between POPs and the development of insulin resistance is lacking. We investigated whether exposure to POPs contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 28 days to lipophilic POPs through the consumption of a high-fat diet containing either refined or crude fish oil obtained from farmed Atlantic salmon. In addition, differentiated adipocytes were exposed to several POP mixtures that mimicked the relative abundance of organic pollutants present in crude salmon oil. We measured body weight, whole-body insulin sensitivity, POP accumulation, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and gene expression and we performed microarray analysis. Adult male rats exposed to crude, but not refined, salmon oil developed insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, and hepatosteatosis. The contribution of POPs to insulin resistance was confirmed in cultured adipocytes where POPs, especially organochlorine pesticides, led to robust inhibition of insulin action. Moreover, POPs induced down-regulation of insulin-induced gene-1 (Insig-1) and Lpin1, two master regulators of lipid homeostasis. Our findings provide evidence that exposure to POPs commonly present in food chains leads to insulin resistance and associated metabolic disorders.', 'This article provides information and a commentary on trials presented at the American Heart Association meeting held in November 2005, relevant to the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of heart failure.

In REPAIR-AMI an improvement in ejection fraction was observed in post-MI patients following infusion of bone marrow stem cells. However, the ASTAMI study showed no benefit of stem cell implantation in a similar patient cohort. The JELIS study reported a reduction in major coronary events in patients receiving statins plus fish oil compared to statins alone. MEGA showed that low dose statins in a low risk population reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events. Two studies of levosimendan in acute heart failure gave conflicting results, in the REVIVE-II study levosimendan was reported to have a superior effect on the composite primary outcome compared to placebo, however, in SURVIVE despite a trend to early benefit with levosimendan, there was no difference in effect on long-term outcome versus dobutamine. The PROACTIVE study showed encouraging results for the use of pioglitazone in post-myocardial infarction patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes.', 'Information is lacking on the potential effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the adipose tissue of patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated whether n-3 PUFAs have additional effects on adiposity, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue function (production of adipokines and inflammatory and atherogenic factors), and gene expression in type 2 diabetes. Twenty-seven women with type 2 diabetes without hypertriglyceridemia were randomly allocated in a double-blind parallel design to 2 mo of 3 g/d of either fish oil (1.8 g n-3 PUFAs) or placebo (paraffin oil). Although body weight and energy intake measured by use of a food diary were unchanged, total fat mass (P < 0.019) and subcutaneous adipocyte diameter (P < 0.0018) were lower in the fish oil group than in the placebo group. Insulin sensitivity was not significantly different between the 2 groups (measured by homeostasis model assessment in all patients and by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in a subgroup of 5 patients per group). By contrast, atherogenic risk factors, including plasma triacylglycerol (P < 0.03), the ratio of triacylglycerol to HDL cholesterol (atherogenic index, P < 0.03), and plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P < 0.01), were lower in the fish oil group than in the placebo group. In addition, a subset of inflammation-related genes was reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue after the fish oil, but not the placebo, treatment. A moderate dose of n-3 PUFAs for 2 mo reduced adiposity and atherogenic markers without deterioration of insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Some adipose tissue inflammation-related genes were also reduced. These beneficial effects could be linked to morphologic and inflammatory changes in adipose tissue.

It is noted that the fish oil diet decreased liver levels of all N-acylethanolamines (except eicosapentaenoylethanolamide and docosahexaenoylethanolamide) with similar changes in precursor lipids. Importantly, it also states that all N-acylethanolamines activated PPAR-alpha. This directly links the intake of fish oil to the activation of the PPAR-alpha gene, which is crucial for understanding the interaction between fish oil and this specific gene.  2. **Impact of Dietary Fats on Endocannabinoid Levels**: The study investigates the impact of different dietary fats, including fish oil, on the levels of various endocannabinoids and related lipid mediators.

PPARs are a group of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors to regulate the expression of genes.  2. **Experimental Evidence of PPAR Activation**: The abstract details experiments showing that both EPA and DHA activate PPAR-gamma, a specific type of PPAR. This activation is quantified by measuring increases in PPAR-gamma mRNA and protein activity, which were reported to be two to threefold in the human renal tubular cells (HK-2 cells) treated with these omega-3 fatty acids.  3. **Mechanism of Action**: The study further explores the mechanism by which omega-3 PUFAs exert their anti-inflammatory effects.

It is noted that the increase in adiponectin secretion induced by fish oil feeding was completely blocked by the administration of a PPARgamma inhibitor. This directly links the action of fish oil to the PPARgamma pathway.  2. **Role of PPARgamma in Fish Oil-Induced Changes**: The inhibition of PPARgamma leading to the blockage of fish oil's effect on adiponectin secretion highlights the role of PPARgamma as a mediator in the mechanism by which fish oil influences adiponectin levels. This is crucial as it demonstrates a specific interaction between fish oil and the PPAR gene, particularly PPARgamma.  3. **Comparative Analysis with PPARalpha**: The study also notes that there was no effect of fish oil feeding on adiponectin secretion in PPARalpha-null mice.
