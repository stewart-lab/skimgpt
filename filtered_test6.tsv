0	657735	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	646	['PMID 23978414: In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and involved mechanisms of resveratrol on an established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) murine model. Wild-type and autophagic mediator ULK1 heterozygous knockout mice were induced to have NAFLD by high-fat diet for 8weeks. After that, resveratrol treatment was applied with the high-fat diet feeding for another 4weeks. Typical features of NAFLD, including histological changes, fibrosis, insulin resistance, oxidative status, and inflammation were characterized. After-treatment with resveratrol showed ameliorative effects on all measured features of NAFLD, from histology, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance to oxidative stress and inflammation. resveratrol treatment also reduced the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through the restoration of its inhibitor IκBα. Partial inhibition of ULK1 expression impaired the ameliorative effects of resveratrol on hepatic histology, fibrosis, oxidative status, inflammation, and NF-κB activity. In conclusion, resveratrol improved NAFLD-caused hepatic injury partially through regulating autophagic and IκBα-NF-κB pathways.', 'PMID 32042044: Autophagy is essential for cellular survival and energy homeostasis under nutrient deprivation. Despite the emerging importance of nuclear events in autophagy regulation, epigenetic control of autophagy gene transcription remains unclear. Here, we report fasting-induced Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21) signaling activates hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation via Jumonji-D3 (JMJD3/KDM6B) histone demethylase. Upon FGF21 signaling, JMJD3 epigenetically upregulates global autophagy-network genes, including Tfeb, Atg7, Atgl, and Fgf21, through demethylation of histone H3K27-me3, resulting in autophagy-mediated lipid degradation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of JMJD3 at Thr-1044 by FGF21 signal-activated PKA increases its nuclear localization and interaction with the nuclear receptor PPARα to transcriptionally activate autophagy. Administration of FGF21 in obese mice improves defective autophagy and hepatosteatosis in a JMJD3-dependent manner. Remarkably, in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, hepatic expression of JMJD3, ATG7, LC3, and ULK1 is substantially decreased. These findings demonstrate that FGF21-JMJD3 signaling epigenetically links nutrient deprivation with hepatic autophagy and lipid degradation in mammals.']	0.0614487510800821	0.5372071064802428	0.0178704805112174	36149	ULK1	96	['PMID 26636543: mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 target--ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin, pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, short-term pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria, which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles (mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death. Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell--survival or cell death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy.']	0.20775012657002	7.080303933178968e-58	0.0091254752851711	10520	pp242	36691282
